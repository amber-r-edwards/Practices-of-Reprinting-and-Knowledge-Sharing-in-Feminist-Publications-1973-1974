went. I fly airplanes. Women

aren't supposed to do that. I went
to Harvard Law School. Women aren't
supposed to do that either. And you
smile and get along and wish you
didn't have to. But you tolerate

it. So I don't say I've never felt
it. I think it's there. But I

still think the whole thing is having
everybody becoming tolerant... of
different living styles, of different
variances in personality. I think
it's a whole thing of human rights.
I'm obviously saying I’m a woman,

but I'm not gonna stand up and say:
"I am for women." Because you then
immediately become a one-issue can-
didate. Or at least the press will
make you a one-issue candidate.

There is, however, a very great
difference between being identified
as a woman and identifying your-
self with women. The essence of
feminism is not simply that we
“want a fair crack at it." It is
more a restructuring of the way
people relate to one another as well
as an identification with the his-
tory and culture of women.

Sex discrimination is not "just
awful." It is an insidious kind of
animal leash which has choked off the
possibilities of capable women every-
where for thousands of years. Teach-
ing a course in women's legal rights
would not make a woman a female
chauvinist. Pat Schroeder herself
has admitted that "the power struc-
ture is totally unthreatened by
us" because "they know we're out-
siders." A woman's legal position
before the law is unique—perhaps
more so than any other group's. Re-
cognizing that men have made the
laws and that those laws benefit
them, it is absurd to pretend that
a course in "male's legal rights"
is necessary to justify the same for
women. That would be like saying
that a course in discrimination
against whites is necessary before
there can be one in discrimination
against blacks!

Years ago individual blacks could
get along in a white world by "smil-
ing and being tolerant," and per-
haps today one woman can get along
in a man's world by the same ques-
tionable methods. There may be per-
sonal success in doing that. Nev-
ertheless, if we as women are to
identify ourselves with all women,
tolerance and subtlety are not al-
ways the answers. (That is not to
say necessarily that yelling and
screaming are either. Obviously
different styles succeed in different
situations.) To answer the question
of discrimination with tolerance,
however, is to be separate and above
other women, who need the voice of
a congresswoman desperately! Pat
Schroeder says that she is "very
concerned with women's rights, but
no more so than with some other is-
sues." It seems to us that it is
much less so. Women do desperately
need the voice of a congresswoman—
a share in her power.

A friend of mine recently made
her own bumper sticker to place
next to Pat Schroeder's slogan, "She
Wins. We win." It read, "She won.
We won.” We'd all like to be able
to say that, too—and mean it.

Pat Schroeder is not a feminist.
At least, not yet.

SOME FURTHER EXCERPTS FROM BIG MAMA

BIG MAMA RAG: IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC
REASON WHY YOU DECIDED TO RUN FOR
CONGRESS?

PAT SCHROEDER: Well, if you're
going to change Congress, you've
got to change the kinds of people
you send there. And I'm very tired
of young men on power trips. I
think we've suffered greatly from
that kind of government.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THE NEW WOMEN
IN CONGRESS ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF
PERSON THAN THESE MEN ON EGO TRIPS?
SCHROEDER: Sure. Yvonne Braith-
waite’s father was a janitor.
Barbara Jordan came out of the South.
We certainly were not a wealthy
family by any means. And yet you
go back and see many of them (con-
gressmen) and they've inherited the
They come from the business
structure or political family. Or
they have certain ties, or they’ve
been ego-maniac types that have been
smooth pretty boys that have been
able to work their way up, and back
scratch a lot. And I really don't
see the women doing that. They've
always announced, "This is where
I was. This is where I stand. Take
it or leave it.”

BMR: WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION DOES
THAT HAVE WITH THEIR BEING WOMEN? DO YOU THINK IT HAS ANY?
SCHROEDER: I think a lot of it is

they couldn't get in on the back-

threatened by us. (women) They
know we're outsiders.

BMR: DO YOU THINK WOMEN WOULD GO
ON THE SAME TYPES OF TRIPS THAT MEN
HAVE?

SCHROEDER: Oh, sure. Nothing makes
me madder than to encounter a woman
who's made it and says: “I've never

If you're going
to emulate the suppressor, then you
have no right to rise to the top.

BMR: ARE THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT
YOU'VE CONSIDERED MODELS? THAT YOU'VE LOOKED UP TO AND RESPECTED?
SCHROEDER: I think one of the
greatest persons I can think of is
Albert Schweitzer. He could have
stayed in Europe and had a phenomenal
career on the concert circuit...
but instead he opted not to give up
music, because it was his love, but
he opted to be a doctor and help
people in Africa.

BMR: IS THERE A WOMAN WHOM YOU
PARTICULARLY ADMIRE?

SCHROEDER: Umm. I really must
say I admire most of all... the
hoards of women who have gone be-
fore us... really bought the line
about being more responsible, more
reasonable and allow their husband,
you know... Incredible the amount
of sacrifice. Anybody who was
able to buy it, and do it was just
almost beyond my comprehension. It's just give give give give give
and no take, thank you, and there
have been incredible amounts of
women like that.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THAT'S ADMIR-
ABLE OR KIND OF STUPID?

SCHROEDER: Well, we're living in a
different time, you know... I
think women have been the givers of
society and I've always admired the
givers more than the takers. And I
think one of the reasons I admire
Albert Schweitzer so much is that he
didn't have to be a giver, he could
have been a taker—because he was a
man and males were expected to be
the takers... People always say
how neat it was for you to run for
Congress and I keep saying it wasn't
nearly so neat of me as it was of my
husband. He could have absolutely
verboten it. He had the power to
shut it off... There was no ques-
tion. If he had demanded a divorce
immediately, every male in the city
would have understood. He has the
power. I don't. I'm on the out-
side asking for it. It's much
easier for me to ask for it than
it is for him to give it up. He has
the power to say: "No. I stay in
Denver with my law practice and my
very secure position." Women have
had to give up for years, and men
haven't, and so I'm always much
more respectful of the one having the
power and giving it up. It's tougher.
He's in the power structure of
Denver. He's giving all that up and
going to Washington where he's total-
ly unknown.

BMR:.. WHY DID HE DO IT?

SCHROEDER: Oh, I don't know. I
just think he's been very sym-
pathetic to the cause all along.
He's been—I shouldn't say radi-
calized—but he's become sensitized
by being in that position. (i.e.,
