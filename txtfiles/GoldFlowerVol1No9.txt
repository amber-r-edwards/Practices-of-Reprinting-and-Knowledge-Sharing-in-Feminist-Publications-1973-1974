HOW TO

How to Have Intercourse  
Without Getting Screwed,  
A Guide to Birth Control,  
Abortion, and Venereal Disease was published  

by the ASUW Women's  
Commission in January  
1972. The second  
printing was funded by  
the Graduate and Professional Student Senate and by the Associated Students of the University of Washington.  

The booklet is dedicated  
to those individuals whose own dedication ensured the passage of abortion reform in Washington State,  
and especially to Dr. A. Frans Koome for his courage both before and after the victory of Referendum 20.  

Since the authors of  
the booklet (Lynn K. Hansen, Barbara Reskin, Diana Gray) have not been trained in medicine, they have drawn  
upon the generous contributions of knowledge by members of Seattle's medical community.  

Special thanks go to  
Dr. Elaine Henley, who read the manuscript several times and provided both technical advice and moral support.  
Lee Minto, director of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Gordon Bergy, University of Washington Health Service,  
and Dr. A. Frans Koome were also kind enough to read the manuscript and to make helpful suggestions.  
Others who provided factual or editorial contributions included Dr. Julius Butler, Dr. J. H. Leversee,  
Jeanne Mannegold, and Jan Krause of the Abortion Referral Service, and Julie Coryell, Elaine Schroeder, and Verna Smith.

HAVE INTERCOURSE...  

without getting screwed  

introduction  

This booklet was written  
to help women and men deal  
with the consequences of sexual activity. Too often,  
lack of knowledge about help  
that is available and about  
how to get that help makes  
sexual relations a cause for  
anxiety and tension. When  
the persons involved are unmarried, their problem be-  
comes even worse: Even if  
they have the guts to put up  
with humiliations and moralizing, they may be denied  
contraceptive help. This  
booklet is an attempt to fill  
that need. Its first goal  
is to give general information  
about conception, contraception, abortion, and  
venereal disease. A second,  
and very important, goal is  
to make known to the reader  
the agencies and services in  
the Seattle area to which  
people can turn for help  
without getting any hassle  
about their morals or activities.  

If there is a more specific  
purpose to the writing of  
this booklet, it is to let  
women know that in their  
search for help they do not  
have to put up with the vagaries of private physicians.  
There are community services  
that regard contraceptive  
assistance as a right of all  
women (regardless of age or  
marital status). For too  
long, women have been at the  
mercy of the private physicians' monopoly of contraceptive technology, a monopoly that has been accompanied  
by a moral tyranny that  
has denied medical care to  
large subgroups of women.  
The authors believe that women  
have the right to know  
about the kinds of assistance  
that are available for controlling conception and  
birth, and they believe that  
women have the right to have  
access to this technology.  
One purpose of this booklet  
is to give women the information they need, so that  
they can demand and obtain  
the kind of contraceptive  
care they want.  

Anatomy  

Female  

The external female sexual  
parts are referred to collectively as the vulva. It  
includes the labia major and  
the labia minor, as well as  
the clitoris, an organ homologous to the male penis and  
the source of sexual pleasure  
in the female. The entrance  
to the vagina may be partially covered by a membrane,  
the hymen or "maidenhead." This will tear during first  
sexual intercourse, or it may  
have been broken previously by  
the use of tampons or for  
some other reason. In an  
exceptional case, the hymen  
may be too thick to be opened without the aid of a physician. The vagina, or birth channel, is the organ of sexual intercourse,  
accepting the male penis and  
the ejaculated semen. The  
vagina extends from the hymen  
to a point past the cervix,  
or opening of the uterus. It  
is extremely elastic and will  
expand when the female is  
sexually stimulated. The vaginal tissues are lubricated by secretions from glands located in the neck  
of the uterus and at the  
opening of the vulva. These  
secretions aid in the ease  
of entry of the penis into  
the vagina during intercourse.  

The uterus, also referred  
to as the womb, is the muscular organ in which the fetus develops. In the upper  
part of the uterus is an  
opening to ducts called the  
fallopian tubes. The tubes,  
called oviducts, conduct the  
ovum or egg, from the ovaries  
to the uterus. A female has  
two ovaries, each of which  
contains thousands of immature  
ova present since birth. Once  
a month, usually, one ovum  
is brought to maturity and  
travels from the ovary to the uterus. If the egg is  
not fertilized within a period of from twenty-four to  
seventy-two hours, it disintegrates, and about fourteen  
days later menses begins.

Female Orgasm

In the female, the organ of
sexual pleasure, the clitoris,
is distinct from the organs
of reproduction. The vagina,
although it reacts to sexual
stimulation, is almost
without nerve endings, and
the role that penetration
plays in orgasm is almost en-
tirely psychological. (See
Appendix II for a discussion
of the myth of vaginal or-
gasm.) Generally, orgasm is
the result of direct or in-
direct clitoral stimulation;
this stimulation may occur
directly by manual or oral
means or indirectly by secon-
dary contact during inter-
course. Masters and Johnson
discuss techniques for stim-
ulating the female in Human
Sexual Inadequacy (see Appen-
dix IV).

Male

In contrast with the sexual
organs of the female, those
of the male are primarily ex-
ternal. They consist of the
penis, the scrotum (a sac
containing the two sperm-
producing organs, or testes),
and the sperm-carrying ducts
from the testicles in the
scrotum to the penis. Under
mental or physical sexual
stimulation, the penis can
become engorged with blood so
that it becomes stiff, or
erect. Immediately at, or
shortly after, sexual climax,
a seminal fluid containing
sperm from the testicles and
a secretion from the seminal
vesicles and the prostate is
ejaculated. Muscular con-
tractions taking place at the
base of the penis force the
seminal fluid past the pro-
state gland, through the ure-
thral canal, and out the
meatus, or the opening at the

Glans Penis

tip of the penis. This ejac-
ulate will generally contain
between thirty million and
sixty million sperm cells.
Secretions from the penis
often occur prior to climax
and ejaculation. These secre-
tions, supplemented by the
secretions from the female,
aid the entry of the penis
into the vagina. This fluid
contains active sperm that
are capable of fertilizing
an egg and causing pregnancy.

Conception

The initial step of con-
ception occurs when the ovum,
the female sex cell, is pen-
etrated by a spermatozoon,
the male sex cell, and the
two cells fuse into a single
new cell. From this united,
fertilized cell originate all
the billions of cells that
will eventually become an in-
fant.

After ovulation, the egg
travels from the ovary to-
ward the uterus through the
fallopian tube. During in-
tercourse, the sperm are de-
posited into the upper part
of the vagina in the region
of the cervix. Most of the
sperm are immobilized by the
acid condition of the vagina.
However, a small proportion
of the total number ejaculat-
ed eventually reach the pro-
tective alkaline fluids of
the cervix, enter the cavity
of the uterus, and begin
their upward movement into
the opening of the fallopian
tubes. There one of them
may fertilize the ovum, which
is migrating toward the uter-
us. Following its penetra-
tion, the sperm progresses

to the pole of the egg oppo-
site its point of entry and
there comes to rest. No
more sperm can enter the egg
or fertilize it. The next
step is the fusion of the
two cells' nuclei into one
parent nucleus; when this
has been accomplished, ferti-
lization is complete.

The fertilized ovum then

divides into two cells, then
the two into four, the four
into eight, and so on. The

still developing fertilized
egg continues its journey
through the fallopian tubes,
reaching the uterus on the
third or fourth day. It
travels around the uterine
cavity a day or two before
it adheres to the uterine
lining and becomes firmly
implanted. Pregnancy now
has begun.

For the fertilization pro-
cess to occur, sexual inter-
course must take place with-
in a period of from five to
seven days before ovulation
or two to three days after
ovulation. The unfertilized
ovum lives only from twenty-
four to seventy-two hours
after ovulation. Evidence
indicates, however, that a
sperm cell may live for up
to seven days in the female
genital tract, and hence
any unprotected intercourse
within seven days before
ovulation might result in
pregnancy.

STALKING THE ' TERRA

the other morning I got up determined, med-
itated, smoked half a joint and did 20 sit-
ups. felt the same -- my revolutionary con-
sciousness hadn't risen a bit so I went out.
a friend, lately of Virginia said to me re-
cently that loving is the essence of life
and sometimes I wonder. I mean about our
capacity for loving and potential capacity
for hating or maybe it's the other way around
except hating takes about seventeen times as
much energy and you always have to remember
to be mad or hateful so that means it's not
really natural to our bodies but everything's
mixed up now anyway to the point where some
people even remember the times they were
happy and loving because they have found
themselves there so seldom. anyway, as much
as our culture has isolated us we're still
contagious like friendly and horrible vibes.
that's one thing that I learned from trans-
cendental meditation was that positive happy
vibes were catchy; and that a bus driver or
a waitress has really a lot of influence on
whole groups of people especially in rush
hours. hacking in Boston I was as dependent
on my passengers for the mood tone as they
were on me as fighting the traffic 9 hrs.
makes one a bit spacey and maybe I came on a
bit hard to some people but I got impatient
with their lack of response. women were the
most apprehensive towards conversation, some
of them even terrified; it's taking us so
long to be friends to one another in the
open I wonder if the revolution can wait
sometimes never mind loving one another,
but the stoned barriers are beginning to
crumble: the other day I saw 2 women on
Hennepin Avenue holding hands but somehow

anymore that doesn't seem so significant but
maybe it is for Mpls. for too long I've
been trying to find someone who could say
something relevant and not totally negative
about what to do about the men in lieu of

the rising tide of women's consciousness and
Pat C. said the other night that some of

them can be saved and I liked that. I was
having trouble with hating all men because
my Judeo-Christian conscience says that you
should love everybody even though they hate,
rape & murder you. I fail to see where wo-
men's love for men has helped men or women
all that much since recorded time began.

but people are screaming you can't go around
hating half of the population because they
were born male. although I don't understand
why you can't hate anything you want to as
well as love anything and besides hate comes
either before or after rejection which is
part of the necessary progression to reclaim-
ing one's own self-love. and C--- said

once that although she loved John she still
had to forgive him for his prick. the ulti-
mate in human relations is of course to be
able to forgive the one you're sleeping with
for nothing, esp. a prick. anyhow, it seems
that all along men have just wanted to hunt
and be wild and run around and kill things
and women have always tried to change that
and make them civilized & loving like women
which is not their nature. so of course they
hate our guts for not letting them be their
pugilistic selves. John Paul Getty ought to
build a mammoth terrarium in the Pacific and
all men could have free one way passage and
slaughter each other to their hearts' content
and leave us women to build our Amazon nation.

Myths About Sex
and Conception

-You can't get pregnant the
first time you have inter-
course.

False. Getting pregnant
doesn't require any practice!
The possibility of concep-
tion occurring depends upon
the timing of intercourse
with respect to ovulation
and is not related to the
amount of sexual experience.

‘You can't get pregnant if
you are a virgin (have not
experienced vaginal penetra-
tion).

False. Sperm are able to
swim past the hymen without
any penetration into the va-
gina by the penis. If sperm
are anywhere near the vagina,
pregnancy is possible.

*You can't get pregnant if

you are nursing an infant.
False. Ovulation can still

occur, and some form of con-

traception is necessary to

prevent conception.

*Look out for men who claim
to be sterile. This claim
may be false. In the first
place, even if the man be-
lieves it to be true or
knows that at one time it
was true, this condition va-
ries over time for many men,
except when the result of
surgery. Furthermore, some
men use this as an excuse to
avoid the bother of practic-
ing contraception. It’s awk-
ward to demand a laboratory
report; nonetheless, be cau-
tious about claims of steril-
ity.

*Women don't have as strong
a sexual drive as do men.
False. A woman is a sex-
ual being, and it is perfect-
ly natural for her to ex-
perience sexual desire ("get
horny") and to become sexual-
ly aroused as a result of
either mental or physical
stimulation. A woman's cap-
acity for sexual desire and
activity is as great as a
man's. In fact, because in-
tercourse is generally less

demanding for a woman, she
is capable of more sustained
sexual activity than is a
man. Becoming sexually a-
roused is largely a product
of letting herself receive
the sexual stimuli around
her. If women seem to exper-
ience less sexual drive than
men, it is often because

they are too concerned with
attracting sexual desire to
be able to respond adequate-
ly themselves.

-If a woman does not experi-
ence "vaginal orgasm," she
is “frigid."

False. The vagina is al-
most completely without
nerve endings, and orgasm is
not a product of vaginal
stimulation. The clitoris
is the physical organ respon-
sible for orgasm in the fe-
male. Orgasm can occur as
the result of direct manual
or oral stimulation or as
the result of the action of
the penis against the vulva
during intercourse. It is
the movement of the penis
against the entrance of the
vagina, not penetration into
the vagina, that causes fe-
male orgasm during inter-
course. Thus, those posi-
tions that provide the most
friction of the penis against
the vulva are most likely to
provide female orgasm. Mas-
ters and Johnson report that
the male-above-face-to-face
position is one of the poor-
est in this respect.

Tribunal Indicts Minnesota for Crimes  
Against Women -- Raises Lobbying Funds  

BY MARY RETSINAS  

The inability to obtain  
safe, legal abortions imposes  
an incredible hardship upon  
the women of Minnesota. In  
order to expose the situa-  
tion, 125 women assembled in  
Luther Hall the evening of  
October 28 in order to put  
the government of the State  
of Minnesota on trial for  
crimes against women. The  
tribunal was sponsored by  
the Minnesota Women's Abor-  
tion Action Coalition, whose  
demands are: to repeal all  
abortion laws, end forced  
sterilization, and an end  
to restrictions on contra-  
ceptives. Endorsers includ-  
ed the Minnesota Organiza-  
tion to Repeal Abortion Laws  
(MORAL), MWPC, Women's Advo-  
cates, U of M Women's Liber-  
ation, West Suburban Council  
for Women's Liberation, and  
Dr. Jane Hodgson.  

MWAAC coordinator Linda  
Willaman began the evening  
by stating that each woman  
testifying represented thou-  
sands. She spoke on the be-  
half of an unnamed fifteen  
year old who could not be  
present because her illegal  
abortion had killed her.  
Robert McCoy spoke at consid-  
erable length, saying that  
those who favor legal abor-  
tion are traditionalists,  
seeing as abortion has only  
been illegal for a little  
over a hundred years. McCoy  
also stated that he felt the  
issue of a woman's right to  
control her own body should  
be underplayed, since this  
idea makes some people uncom-  
fortable. The identity of  
these odd individuals who  
don't think people should  
control their bodies is open  
to conjecture.  

Every single candidate for  
the Minnesota Legislature  
was sent an invitation to  
the tribunal. None came,  
one sent a contribution.  
Two women volunteered to  
testify that they were forci-  

but  

bly sterilized, but had to  
back down because they fear-  
ed repercussions from wel-  
fare. (Surprised, anyone?)  
Renee Ward of MORAL and  
Enid Griffen of NOW both  
spoke. Rebecca Muir of  
U of M Women's Liberation  
told of her illegal abortion  
in Montreal. The University  
health service diagnosed her  
pregnancy as a tumor, which  
delayed her past New York's  
24 week limit, so she was  
forced to seek an illegal  
abortion. She was given a  
D & C without anaesthetic  
and whisked onto the street  
with no time to recover, and  
with the information that the  
cabbie that picked her  
up would probably be from  
the police. She spent the  
night in terror of bleeding  
to death or spending years  
in a foreign jail. After de-  
claring a suitcase of Kotex  
to the customs officials,  
she had to run the length of  
the airport to catch the  
plane and avoid the police.  
Other interesting testi-  
mony was that of Mary Fuess-  
ner, who the Minnesota Daily  
described with sexism that is  
admittedly unusual for them,  
as a "Minneapolis housewife."  
Fuessner conceived twice  
with IUDs. She compared  

MWAAC - UNIVERSITY WOMEN’S LIBERATION  

health care here with that  

in Czechoslovakia, where she  
discovered her first preg-  
nancy. She stated that the  
New York doctor asked her  

why she didn't learn her les-  
son the first time around,  
and she said, "I knew I was  
back in America when I had to  
wait four hours to be hassled  
by a doctor." An interesting  
sidelight is that Mary was  
sterilized this summer, and  
now has reason to believe  

she is pregnant again, which  
if nothing else illustrates  
the necessity of having abor-  
tion available in the face  

of contraceptive failure.  

Etta Magnusen of MWAAC  
auctioned off portions of  
Bella Abzug's abortion rights  
act. The audience responded  
enthusiastically. In the  
course of the evening, $277  
was raised.  

MWAAC needs more money, be-  
cause on International Wo-  
men's Day, the Women's Abor-  
tion Action Coalition will  
hold a similar tribunal in  
New York on an international  
scale. Noted persons from  
all over will attend. Simone  
de Beauvoir will be the  
chairperson. WONAAC litera-  
ture says, "The tribunal will  
hear testimony from Black  
Women, Latina Women, Chica-  
nas, Native American and  
Asian Women, Gay Women, High  
School and College Women,  
Working Women, Women in the  
Military, and Catholic Wo-  
men." All sisters are en-  
couraged to testify and to  
attend, and if they can't,  
to help MWAAC out with money  
or with time. Women have  
certainly suffered long  
enough on account of laws  
that make it illegal for a  
human being to control her  
own body.

j Do not marry a girl who is extravagant, who during  

‘ courtship expects you to spend your money lavishly on  

her, who gives you no reason to believe that, after  

L marriage, she would help you to save, or to make the  
“® least sacrifice for you or for your mutual benefit.  

Should you have a good position, or have well-to-do  

parents, satisfy yourself during courtship that the girl  

‘ thinks more of you than of your money. What her motive  

4 is will be easy to discover; for if she expects you to  

i purchase expensive gifts for her, then she evidently  

f thinks more of such gifts than of you. After marriage  

§ she might turn you down and sue you for most of  

your income by way of alimony.  

The girl should not marry a young man who is sel-  
fish, who is spoiled by his parents, who has no ambition  
and insufficient moral courage to try to make anything  
of himself.  

Do not think of marrying one who does not regard  
marriage as a very sacred state of life, who would prefer  
to be a society belle than a mother.  

Do not contract a hasty marriage before knowing  
the background of the girl whom you court, before know-  
ing her parents, her ideals, her tastes, her willingness to  
cooperate with you, both in a spiritual and a material  
way.  

Do not mistake fascination for love, because the  
former may have nothing in common with the latter.  
You have often heard that “beauty is only skin deep.”  
Therefore, beauty should be subordinated to character,  
and you cannot learn one’s character in a brief time.  
Therefore, there can be no such thing as “love at first  
sight.” You should take ample time to study her char-  
acter, her disposition, her inclinations and she should  
try to discover your characteristics as well. One out of  
every five divorces takes place within the first year of  
marriage which is proof that the two young people did  
not sufficiently understand each other before they vowed  
loyalty for life.  

Never even begin to keep company with a widow.  
Leave her to the widower. And, of course, never give  
the least encouragement to the divorcee who asks you

for a date. You are not allowed to marry him or her  
before God. Surely you should not be willing even to  
run the risk of marrying one whose first marriage was  
a failure.  

Do not marry the man or the woman who has not a  
high regard for virtue, because you can be sure that,  
after marriage, you will be suspicious and jealous of  
him or her. That is the lesson of history and the lesson  
of common sense. Holy Scripture makes it very clear  
that Almighty God will not bless a marriage which was  
not preceded by a clean courtship.  

Do not form your ideas of marriage by the pre-  
vailing American opinion, because it is absolutely wrong.  
Marriage is held less sacred in the United States than in  
any country in the world; and the scores of sex books  
and sexy story magazines, which circulate in the United  
States, are barred even from pagan countries. Marriage  
is a Sacrament for you whether you wish it to be or  
not, and people do not prepare for the reception of Sac-  
raments by a sinful life, nor receive them in a state of  
sin. If they do, they are sure to get into trouble: “God  
is not mocked.”  

Early in courtship try to find out whether your  
girl can cook. You might have had several meals at  
her home, but they were likely cooked by her mother—  
and you are not marrying her mother. You will not  

‘ likely be able to afford a servant to do your cooking, and  

even if you were, good servants are hard to get today.  

If the girl you court would rather have a date or go  
to a movie, to a dance, to a refreshment parlor, than to  
attend church services during a Novena, during Forty  
Hours, during Lent, or on some important feast, then  
she is not likely to be a prayerful wife and mother after  
marriage. If you would have God bless your marriage,  
give Him the first and not the last place during the time  
you are keeping company.  

“Common sense” on the part of both parties is a  
prerequisite for happiness. You might call it level-  
headedness. This common sense is needed for the man-  
agement of the home, for the following of a budget, for  
the proper rearing of children, and even to do the right  
thing in social life.

A recent article in the Tribune said that  
the Minneapolis police do not consider my  
neighborhood, the Grant-Nicollet area, “the  
friendliest part of town," because of the  
"derelicts, prostitutes and drug peddlers"  
it harbors. Now what the neighborhood is  
like all depends on who you are, and if you  
are a youngish woman, then you do not suffer  
from lack of "friendly" attention.  

Uninvited attention is, for me, the great-  
est drawback of the neighborhood. I can go  
scarcely a block on foot, night or day, with-  
out slowing down cars and attracting offers  
of this and that. But this persistent inter-  
ference does not come from area residents -  
it comes from the hands and mouths and minds  
of invading men from all over the city and  
suburbs who are out to purchase a pound or  
two of female flesh.  

Drunks sprawled insensible at bus stops or  
stray dogs soiling city streets are both con-  
sidered public nuisances and are properly  
dispatched by the authorities. But the case  
of marauding men harassing women because they  
live in a given area is another matter en-  
tirely, because these men are the authori-  
ties, or their friends, or their brothers-in-  
law. During the national VFW convention this  
summer, the number of solitary men in big  
cars patrolling our streets was easily  
doubled.  

Oh, Those Solicitation Myths  

Of course, taxpayers could not consider  
derelicts, prostitutes, drug peddlers, or  
the people who live near them, the public.  
Whatever indignities the neighborhood must  
bear are naturally its own fault and are  
bred by its own inner forces. If anyone is  
responsible for the male behavior in the  
area, it is the prostitutes, not the men  
themselves.  

So the thinking goes, and so the soliciti-  
ing goes on. But contrary to popular soli-  
citation myths, it is not jaded profession-  
als snaring unwary teenage boys; rather it  
is men of all professions grasping myopically  
after any woman they see.  

Maybe we have always thought it is one de-  
vil of a fine thing for men to want us even  
when we do not want them. When they so  
prize us, separately or collectively, either

as a temporary taste delight or as an inex-  
haustible source of sustenance, it is only  
natural, indeed stimulating, for us to give  
them some reward for their efforts.  

But picture yourself walking, quite pur-  
posefully, to work, complete with briefcase,  
bag lunch, and a few library books. A car  
turns in front of you and the man inside  
gives you the eye, just as he gives every  
moving figure in his range that selfsame  
eye. You return his burning gaze, hoping to  
singe him back with your somewhat different  
feelings of distaste and belligerence. But  
unfortunately your look is only one sensuous  
ingredient away from pouty provocation; he  
speeds around the block after confirming his  
chances with a doubletake and arrives along-  
side you with an open door and a confident,  
"Hop in." It is 8:30 a.m. and you are late  
for work.  

I have not been stopped with curlers in my  
hair only because I do not use curlers. Give  
me a full grocery bag, a box of glass for  
recycling, a struggling child to be carried,  
and I will still receive my regular quota of  
cocky propositions. The only time I am not  
pursued is when I am with another man, and  
even then the second glances flurry around  
us to make sure he is not a woman too.  

In the eyes of these men, who by the looks  
of their cars and their clothes, are a rea-  
sonable cross-section of middle class Minne-  
apolis, most women are only one neighborhood  
away from being prostitutes. If black peo-  
ple all look alike to bigots, then we should  
not be too surprised when women all look  
alike to souped-up sexists.  

Men eyeballing women is the most wide-  
spread form of bad manners that is still  
considered to be acceptable. If street con-  
frontations stop short of actual rape,  
women have, supposedly, nothing to complain  
about. But nobody, not even a realistic  
woman, ever gets used to abuse.  

What do you do? Send your amusement, your  
anger, your disinterest straight to the next  
man who solicits your charms and hope that  
a fraction of it gets through. Then hold  
some of those same reactions in reserve and  
have your own jokes ready the next time you  
hear solid citizens snicker about women in  
the street.

The "Minnesota Citizens
Concerned for Life" and other
"Right to Life" groups who
oppose revising Minnesota's
antiquated abortion statute
have consistently continued
to claim that the termina-
tion of pregnancy is a medi-
cally dangerous procedure.
They have magnified the rate
at which complications occur
and have been guilty of pur-
posely inflating the statis-
tics which are readily avail-
able to all. I believe it
is time to look at facts in-
stead of listening to opini-
ons furnished by those groups
who wish to force all women
to continue with pregnancies,
desired or not.

Gordon Chase, the Administra-
tor of New York City Health
Service Administration re-
leased the following informa-
tion in October 1972:

In the first two years of
the newly revised law in New
York, 402,059 abortions were
performed in New York City. 
There was only one maternal
death associated with a legal

first-trimester abortion in
the second year (1971-1972),
and there is some question
about the duration of the
pregnancy. In the first
year, there were 3 first-
trimester abortion deaths for
a rate of 2.1 deaths per
100,000 abortions, and in the
second year this decreased to
0.5/100,000 abortions indica-
ting an exceedingly small
risk attached to first-tri-
mester abortions performed
with proper medical safe-
guards.

Like every other surgical
procedure, abortion has at-
tendant complications. In
the first year, the rate of
reported complications was
8.5/1000 abortions which de-
creased in the second year
to 7.2/1000 abortions.

These include all complica-
tions, minor and major, in
pregnancies of duration up to
24 weeks of gestation. It is
well known that the incidence
of complications increases
rapidly with the length of
gestation. For the first-
trimester abortions, the rate
of complications dropped from
4-6/1000 abortions during the
first year to 3.0/1000 abor-
tions in the second year.
There is some evidence that
the increase in the number of
complications (not the rate)
is due to the improvement in
the reporting procedure.

Since the abortion law be-
came effective, there has
been a definite improvement
in the maternal mortality
rate, that is, the number of
women dying of pregnancy com-
plications including the
after-effects of criminal
abortions. The overall

maternal death rate in New
York for the two year period
under the new law was 37.7
deaths per 100,000 live
births, a statistically sig-
nificant 28% decline from the
preceding two year period
when it was 52.2 deaths per
100,000 live births.

The infant mortality dropped
to an all-time low in
1971; this rate has continued
to decline since the advent
of the newly enacted legisla-
tion.

Out-of-wedlock births had
been increasing dramatically
in recent years. In 1971,
the number of out-of-wedlock
births dropped 11.8% from
1970. This was the first de-
cline since 1954.

The number of “incomplete
abortions" have also declined
drastically. "Incomplete
abortions" in many instances
reflect self-induced or
criminally induced abortions
especially when the patient
becomes infected as a result
of the abortion. Data from
10 reporting New York City
Municipal Hospitals show a
sharp decline from 415 incom-
plete abortions per month
in 1970-1971 to 220 per
month in 1971-1972. This
reflects a true decline in
the number of criminal abor-
tions.

is available to all. Let us
make decisions on the basis
of facts rather than opinions
based upon emotion.

UNIVERSITY  
HEALTH  
SERVICE  

Decent health care is our  
right. It is the right of  
every human being, and in-  
come, age, odor, and personal  
appearance and degree of sex-  
ual activity could not be  
more immaterial. It is our  
right as surely as it is our  
right to live and die in de-  
cent circumstances. It be-  
comes increasingly apparent  
that the ideal doesn't pre-  
vail, in Mill City or else-  
where.  

Women are badly screwed in  
the delivery of health care.  
Any woman who has gone to a  
contraceptive clinic knows  
what it's like to feel like  
meat on a rack. Contracep-  
tives that are obviously  
still experimental are dis-  
pensed to women free with  
VD tests and insults, seem-  
ingly a very low wage for  
being a guinea pig and plac-  
ing one's life on the line  
in the name of population  
control. Contraceptives  
that are at once safe, re-  
versible, and effective sim-  
ply do not exist. To add  
insult to injury, abortion  
is unavailable in Minnesota  
not only in the case of con-  
traceptive failure, but also  
in cases of rape, fetal de-  
formity and even death, and  
psychological distress to  
the woman. Women on welfare  
are coerced into steriliza-  
tion and abortion, under  
threat of having the source  
of support to living child-  
ren removed.  

The inequitable situation  
is maintained, in part, by  
the exclusive, inbred, mu-  
tual admiration society that  
is the medical profession.  
The U of M med school has a  
10% enrollment of women,  
which is considered by its  
administrators to be quite  
liberal (10% out of 53% of  
the population?). Those  
women who manage to wallow  
through this built-in sexism  
are often co-opted by anoth-  
er snare: the medical  
mystique.

their eight years schooling

is the brass to play god.  
This brass is a double  
bladed ax that permits them  
to simultaneously do great  
services and sometimes, make  
great blunders. Finally,  
one of the greatest oppo-  
nents of socialized medicine  
is the medical profession at  
large, and the AMA specifi-  
cally. Most physicians are  
also opposed to the expan-  
sion of medical schools,  
which might begin to remedy  
the criminal shortage of MDs  
in the U.S. There are 133  
physicians per 100,000 pa-  
tients.  

One place where women have  
succeeded in making concrete  
progress in the arena of wo-  
men's health care is the U  
of M health service. In  
1971, the University of Minn-  
esota Women's Liberation  
group set about to make the  
health service earn its keep  
by presenting and publiciz-  
ing these five demands:  

1) Pap smears at no extra  
charge; 2) post-miscarriage  
and post-abortive care; 3)  
pregnancy tests at no extra  
charge; 4) a publicized abor-  
tion referral service; 5) no  
moral harassment.  

Every student at the Uni-  
versity pays twenty-one dol-  
lars a quarter for the use  
of the health service, and  
although women were no ex-  
ception, they were seemingly  
not getting their money's  
worth since the essential  
services listed above were  
not available.  

The health service did not  
jump at the chance to meet  
the needs of women. When  
asked if the needs of women  
would be met by the health  
service, Director Donald Co-  
wen replied, "but there is a  
clinic across the street."  
In an overwhelming rush of  
moral beneficence, Pap  
smears, a test for uterine  
cancer, were granted in Jan-  
uary. Perhaps they were  
swayed by the argument that  
sperm counts could be obtain-  
ed free, hardly a matter of  
life and death except per-  
haps for a few males' egos.

MEETS  
WOMEN'S  
DEMANDS  

In the spring there was a  
student election, in which  
80% of those voting stated  
they supported all the fem-  
inists' demands as stated on  
the ballot. Since the  
health service is supported  
entirely by student fees,  
the health service position  
appeared less and less valid.  

In the fall of 1972, the  
directorship changed hands,  
and the demands were met.  
Nurse clinicians were  
appointed to chaperone the  
gynecologists, who certainly  
can use some help. Women  
who seek abortions are given  
written referrals, instead  
of the verbal ones they re-  
ceived on an erratic basis  
last year, and are told to  
return for a checkup. Last  
year the stated health ser-  
vice policy was to have  
nothing to do with pregnancy.  

Ms. Jane McNamara has been  
appointed as Patient Ombuds-  
man. McNamara claims she  
follows up every complaint  
put in the health service  
suggestion box. She is  
available through Periodic  
Health at 373-4017. Com-  
plaints may also be present-  
ed to U of M Women's Libera-  
tion at 373-0033. It is on-  
ly logical that the health  
service still needs to be  
supervised by its patients,  
even after all that work.  

The story has a fitting  
close. Bureaucracies have  
very short memories. Paul  
Ruprecht, present director  
of the health service, stat-  
ed in the Minnesota Daily,  
"Whatever is available today  
(for women at the health  
service) was available last  
year." It is to laugh...  
here's what's available,  
through the efforts of some  
angry, persistent women, and  
the University community  
that backed them: Pap  
smears at no extra charge,  
post-miscarriage and post  
abortive care, pregnancy  
tests at no extra charge,  
publicized abortion referral,  
a patient advocate, and  
chaperones for the gynecolo-  
gists. Power to the Sisters!

Revolution, Not Reform

Steinem Raises Funds,  
Hopes for DFL Women  

by Jan Jirak  

Gloria Steinem, one of  
America's most talented jour-  
nalists and an editor of Ms.  
magazine, arrived in Minnea-  
polis on Saturday, October 28  
to help the DFL female candi-  
dates with their campaigns.  

The day's activities began  
with a $10 brunch at 1730  
Franklin Avenue in Minneapo-  
lis. Ms. Steinem mingled al-  
most unrecognized through the  
gathering of almost 200 women  
and a few men in the opulent  
surroundings. The absence of  
mobbing and male reporter-  
pushiness seemed almost to  
amuse her.  

After the guests brunched  
on cheese, fruit, and sweet-  
breads, Koryn Horbal, state  
DFL committeewoman, intro-  
duced the male politicians  
and the female candidates.  
Gloria then began her address  
in her characteristically en-  
gaging manner with praise of  
the Minnesota women's move-  
ment. The women sat on the  
floor while Ms. Steinem spoke  
of politics in the traditional  
sense of the word, and also  
as any power struggle be-  
tween distinct groups of peo-  
ple. She addressed the prob-  
lem in a historical, anthro-  
pological sense, recalling  
the years of gynocracy fol-  
lowed by paternalism, and  

called for a new era of equal-  

ity. Economic considerations  
followed as an intensely  
feminist issue involving all  
women (We are all "one man  
away from welfare.").  
Steinem also stressed that  
"The parallel between women  
and all racial groups is one  
of the basic facts of Ameri-  
can life," and that the ra-  
cial minorities and women  

must join in their common  
cause. She called for a true  
revolution in the American  
way of thinking that discrim-  
inates against people who  
look different; not just re-  
form.  

In short, Steinem touched  
on every feminist issue ex-  
cept abortion and gayness.  

From Franklin Avenue the  
women shifted to the Labor  
Temple on Fourth Street for  
a $2 rally. The male, Estab-  
lishment press was there, and  
the crowd was bigger. The  
atmosphere lacked some of  
the feeling of trust that  
emanated at the brunch.  
There, under the glare of  
lights, Steinem hurriedly  
summarized her morning's re-  
marks. She also added some  
remarks on abortion and sev-  
eral about Nixon.  

The audience was with her  
all the way, but with less  
personal warmth than I felt  
at the morning's gathering.  
The Establishment press gave  
her almost no coverage. The  
next day's paper carried two  
lines about the event. The  
TV stations devoted about 60  
seconds. It seems only the  
feminist and educational  
presses dare acknowledge the  
importance of what Steinem  

represents.  

Perhaps her message of  
"Revolution, not reform" is  
best told by an incident  
that occurred as she left  
the Labor Temple. A nervous  
young man approached and  

asked her for her autograph.  

Gloria smiled and replied,  
"No, I don't think so--  
that's the old-fashioned way  
of doing things."

"I couldn't not come here  
today because of how fantas-  
tic the women of this state  
are. I should be asking  

you the questions, like how  
did you do it, and would  

you like to move to New  
York?"  

Well-educated women, most  
of them married to afflu-  
ence, predominated in the  
group of women gathered to  
hear Gloria Steinem speak  
in support of the Minnesota  
women candidates. Gloria  
geared her comments to their  
interests, but did not cod-  
dle them. "Marriage...is  
locking up women long e-  
nough to figure out who  
sired the baby." And she  
spoke of the poor woman's  
problem in a rich woman's  
terms: "Every woman is only  
one man away from welfare."  

Most of the audience en-  
joyed the privilege of white  
skin. She spoke of our kin-  
ship with blacks.  

"The parallel between wo-  
men and all racial groups  
is the basic fact of Ameri-  
can life...As long as one  
group of people is discrim-  
inated against because of  
the way they look, we are  
all in danger."  

The audience included wo-  
men who have had to use  
"feminine wiles" to main-  
tain themselves. Steinem  
spoke of Uncle Tomming.  

"We all know what Uncle  
Tomming is, don't we? It's  
giggling and laughing around  
men, and giving our ideas to  
the man next to us so it  
will be accepted, and say-  
ing, 'Oh, how clever you are  
to know it's Tuesday.'"  

Many of the women present  
had married influential men.  

She spoke of Pat and Dick  
Nixon.  

"President Nixon vetoed  
the child care bill. It's  
interesting to note that Mrs.  
Nixon belonged to a group  
that favored that bill--  
which just proves that you  
can't marry power. You have  
to have your own."  

All of us were high on  
Sisterhood. It carried us  
to the Labor Temple where we  
embraced more of our sisters  
for another session of cath-  
artic self-acceptance.  

There Steinem and the audi-  
ence communicated in a regu-  
lar rhythm of humor and  
laughter, truth and applause.  
Her remarks generally sum-  
marized her morning's mater-  
ial. She described Nixon as  
a war criminal, and said  
that McGovern, while he did  
not have all the answers,  
"at least would not punish  
us as Nixon does."  

She described many women  
as "man junkies." We must  
have a man at our side; "if  
they only knew how little  
difference it makes which  
man it is."  

'One Man Away from Welfare'

recognition, then knowing  
applause.  

Steinem commented that one  
of the most subtle, chauvan-  
istic responses to the wo-  
men's movement is that men  
are so fragile, they would-  
n't be able to function if  
women were equal--they would  
not be members "of the  
jockocracy in good standing."  

If we remember only two  
words from Gloria's message,  
let them be, "No  

"No more!  
more will we allow a power  
structure which allows all  
the typists to be one kind  
of person and all the money-  
makers to be another kind of  
person. Women are beginning  
to actively respond to this  
society, and their response  
is, “No More!"  

by Mary  

Ten years ago, I was a  
22-year-old newspaper re-  
porter in Duluth, Minn., with  
a surfeit of naive idealism  
about my ability to alter  
the world with my pen. In  
1962 there was no “women's  
movement."  

At that time, I read  
many fashion magazines.  
A young writer named Gloria  
Steinem appeared regularly  
in "Mademoiselle" and  
"Glamour." She wrote witty,  
bright features about "find-  
ing your fashion type" and  
more serious articles about  
young women working in jour-  
nalism and allied fields.  
She was an extremely attrac-  
tive young woman and often  
appeared in the fashion mag-  
azines as a model for would-  
be career women.  

One very cold, dank night,  
I leafed through a copy of  
"Show" magazine and stopped  
at an article by Gloria  
Steinem on her "undercover"  
stint as a Playboy Bunny.  
The story was well-written  
but, more important, there  
was a strain of real con-  
cern for and indignation  
about the state of women  
working in the Playboy Clubs.  
There was no name for wo-  
men's consciousness in 1962  
but Steinem displayed just  
that in her article. The  
kernel of some disquiet  
grew in my mind but laid  
dormant until two years ago,  
when I, along with millions  
of American women, joined  
the women's movement.  

Although my progress in  
the past 10 years has been  
modest and Steinem's im-  
pressive, I had an oppor-  

Steinem -- 10 Years After  

tunity to reflect on the  
similarity of all women's  
experience when I attended  
the DFL Women's Caucus Fund-  
raiser in one of the Dayton  
Mansions October 28.  

The handsome old rooms  
were filled with impressive  
political names--Don Fraser,  
Warren Spannaus, Richard  
Moe and Koryn Horbal. Joan  
Mondale attended. DFL  
women's candidates such as  
Phyllis Kahn and Linda  
Berglin were there. Women  
who were not interested in  
the women's movement and  
women who were passionately  
interested in the women's  
movement attended.  

The guest of honor and  
keynote speaker was Gloria  
Steinem.  

I had an opportunity to  
meet Steinem and speak  
briefly with her. She is  
one of the few "celebrities"  
I have ever met whose  
"persona" exceeded her  
press.  

She is a humane and in-  
telligent human being. She  
held the "name-filled" aud-  
ience in the palm of her  
hand: and inspired the poor-

It was satisfying to  
realize that this woman, who  
10 years ago was limited to  
commenting on a circumscrib-  
ed "women's world" is now  
recognized for her leader-  
ship and humanity and is a  
national political force  
who will leave her mark on  
history.  

Women have progressed.

The ARA petition campaign  
is a major project of WONAAC  
as it relates directly to  
our demand to repeal all  
abortion laws. The peti-  
tion campaign offers great  
opportunities to the abor-  
tion repeal movement by not  
only providing strong proof  
of the support of our de-  
mands but also by intro-  
ducing women to WONAAC and  
encouraging them to acti-  
vate their talents and ener-  
gies by getting signatures.  

New York Congresswoman  
Bella Abzug introduced the  
bill into Congress in May of  
1972, and she has called for  
hearings to get the bill  
out of the House Judiciary  
Committee and onto the  
floor. Abzug was re-elected  
on Nov. 7 and will continue  
the fight when Congress  
reopens in January. Our  
strong, visible petition  
campaign on both a national  
and local level will give  
credence and support for  
the Abortion Rights Act  
of 1972.  

Locally, the Minnesota  
Women's Abortion Action  
Coalition is planning to  
collect 25,000 of the  
1 million needed signatures.  

At this point, we have only  
5,000, and need lots of help  
to reach our goal. Petition-  
ing can be done anywhere,  
in neighborhoods, local  
shopping areas, downtown,  
schools, etc.-- the poss-  
ibilities are endless.  

MWAAC meets every Tuesday  
at 7:30 p.m. Everyone is  
welcome. We meet at the Old  
Millsbury Library, 100 Uni-

PETITION FOR ABORTION  
RIGHTS ACT OF 1972  

Title: A BILL TO ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF FEMALES TO TERMINATE  
PREGNANCIES THAT THEY DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE  

IS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, WE, THE  
UNDERSIGNED RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CALL UPON  
CONGRESS TO ENACT THE ABORTION RIGHTS ACT OF 1972.  

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress  
assembled, that  

(a) The Congress finds and declares that  

(1) the constitutional right of privacy, embodied in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amend-  
ments to the Constitution of the United States, and applicable to the States through the due process clause  
of the Fourteenth Amendment thereto, includes the right of any female to terminate a pregnancy that she  
does not wish to continue;  

(2) this right is a fundamental and inherent right, and is likewise not subject to infringement by the  
United States or by several States by virtue of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Con-  
stitution of the United States and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amend-  
ment thereto;  

(3) there is no countervailing federal, State, or public interest of a compelling or other nature suf-  
ficient to justify the infringement of this right by the United States or any State.  

(b) In order to secure the constitutional rights set forth in subsection (a) and this subsection, and in  
the exercise of its power to enforce the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United  
States, the Congress declares that it is necessary to prohibit the United States and the several States from  
enacting or enforcing any law, State constitutional provision, regulation, policy or other device which  
infringes upon the said right in any way, or which deprives any female of access to adequate medical  
assistance in the exercise of such right.  

SEC. 2. Neither the United States nor any State shall enact or enforce any law, State constitutional  
provision, regulation, policy, or other device which infringes the right of any female to terminate a preg-  
nancy that she does not wish to continue, or which deprives any female of access to adequate medical  
assistance in the exercise of such right.  

SEC. 3. Notwithstanding the amount in controversy, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2283  
of title 28, United States Code, or any successor provision thereto, the district courts of the United States  
shall have jurisdiction over actions brought to enforce the provisions of this Act; including but not limited  
to jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Act.  

SEC. 4. As used in this Act, the term "State” means any of the several States of the United States, the  
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United  
States.  

SEC. 5. If any provision of this Act or the application of any provision thereof to any person or cir-  
cumstance is judicially determined to be invalid, the remainder of this Act or the application of such provi-  
sion to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such determination.  

SEC. 6. This Act may be cited as the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972.”

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?

SCANT COMPLIANCE FOUND LOCALLY  
WITH EQUAL EMPLOYMENT LAWS  

Women seeking to enter new  
job areas--or to move up in  
those they've already  
entered--should become aware  
of the provisions of the  
year-old "affirmative ac-  
tion" laws that require pri-  
ority hiring of women on  
projects entailing $50,000  
or more in federal monies.  

Contractors for projects  
in the Minneapolis area--in-  
cluding the Model City pro-  
gram as well as several  
major construction projects  
--have not yet acted upon  
the laws, despite increasing  
pressure to do so.  

Legislative guidelines  
provide that federally-  
funded contractors must "re-  
cruit, hire, train and pro-  
mote persons in all job  
classifications" regardless  
of sex. Contractors must  
also assist with "corrective  
action" those who have been  
retarded in job advancement  
through previous discrimin-  
ation.  

This means that employers  
can no longer use the "no  
qualified women applicants"  
excuse when women are under-  
represented on their staffs.  
It means too that the high-  
ly paid skilled trades must  
open their doors to women--  
and that women must be off-  
ered opportunities to move  
into increasingly more re-  
sponsible positions in  
their present jobs.  

The law specifies that  
"officials and managers,  
professionals, technicians,  
sales workers, and craftsmen"  
are job fields which must be  
opened to women under the  
new guidelines.  

In order to ensure com-  
pliance with the law, con-  
tractors must prepare writt-  
en affirmative action pro-  
grams; they are then bound  
to increase employment of  
women according to their  
stated timetables and per-  
centages.  

Despite this law, only  
the University of Minnesota  
has already in operation an  
affirmative action program  
for women and minorities.  
The city of Minneapolis, the  
Model City program, and the  
many federally-funded con-  
struction projects have  
not yet come forth with  
written programs for women,  
despite legislative direc-  
tion to the contrary. Some,  
on the other hand, have sub-  
mitted programs to improve  
ratios of minority men en-  
gaged in government-contrac-  
ted work.  

The legislation provides  
that government contractors  
supply separate hiring pro-  
grams for women and minor-  
ities. Each must be based  
upon a "utilization analy-  
sis" which will include:  

"the size of the female un-  
employment force in the la-  
bor area; the percentage of  
the female workforce as com-  
pared with the total work-  
force; the general availa-  
bility of women; the avail-  
ability of promotable and  
transferable female employ-  
ees; the degree of training  
which the contractor is rea-  
sonably able to undertake."  

Upon completion of the  

utilization analysis, the  
legislation requires that  
goals and timetables must be  
established. "Goals should  

be specific for planned re-  
sults, with timetables for  
completion," the law states.  
“Goals, timetables and af-  
firmative action commitment  
must be designed to correct  
any identifiable deficien-  
cies." Again, the guide-  
lines specify “specific  
goals and timetables sep-  
arately for minorities and  
women."  

In addition, these goals  
must "consider the antici-  
pated expansion, contraction  
and turnover of and in the  
workforce."  

The year-old laws apply  
even to advertising, emplo-  
yee handbooks and annual  
reports--any company or ag-  
ency effort which directly,  
or indirectly affects em-  
ployment.  

"When employees are fea-  
tured in product or consumer  
advertising, employee hand-  
books or similar publications  

next, pipefitting  

"I wouldn't want to wake  
up next to a lady pipefit-  
ter."--R. Nixon.  

Six local women have  
challenged discriminatory  
hiring practices by applying  
for apprenticeships in four  
skilled trades.  

The women applied through  
the Labor Education Advance-  
ment Program (LEAP) last  
week for positions in cab-  
inet-making, carpentry,  
truck driving and carpet in-  
stallation.  

Only one woman is presently  
in the LEAP program, which  
is designed to place appli-  
cants as apprentices in the  
construction and related  
trades. Other LEAP enrollees  
are minority males.  

Apprentices in the skilled  
trades work for three years  
at 60-90 percent of journey-  
man wages. Hourly wages  
thereafter range from $4.59  
for cabinet-making to $7.33  
for painting.  

"Women must realize that  
the door to construction  
work is ajar," said Norm  
Overby of LEAP last week.  
"It isn't open yet, but you  
can at least get a foot in  
now."  

both minority and nonminor-  
ity, men and women should be  
pictured...When employees  
are pictured in consumer or  
help wanted advertising,  
both minorities and non-  
minority men and women  
should be shown."  

Action programs must be  
supported by active parti-  
cipation in summer-work,  
work-study, and on-the-job-  
training programs; formal  
career counseling programs  
and remedial job training  
must also be offered. And,  
should the point be missed,  
the law specifies that  
"female employees should not  
be required to possess high-  
er qualifications than those  
of the lowest qualified in-  
cumbent."  

Women who feel they have been  
discriminated against under  
these new laws should seek  
aid through the Women's  
Equity Action League, the  
Women's Advocates of St.  
Paul or the Equal Employ-  
ment Opportunities Commis-  
sion.

Walker Art Center's  
American Indian Art show  
pays eloquent tribute to a  
people who knew the "Secret  
of Humanity": "Because I  
am poor, I pray for every  
living creature."

A ARNE SES A IT,

The Exhibition--"American  
Indian Art: Form and Trad-  
ition" gathers together the  
American Indian's major art  
objects--pottery, basketry,  
hide painting, carved fig-  
ures, shields, pouches and  
painted hides.

The collection, which  
dates from the early 19th  
century to the present, pro-  
duced a profound shock in me.  
For before me I saw the  
remnants of a tradition  
both harmonious and open-  
handed. The American Indian  
understands that the land  
which nurtures him is amor-  
phous as the air he  
breathes--that the human  
walks over the land and  
sleeps upon it, but never  
owns it. And he has paid  
dearly for this understand-  
ing. I was painfully  
aware of the dichotomy be-  
tween the harmony of the  
collection and the knowledge  
of the Indian's destiny  
meted out by the white man.  
His nervous, grasping rape  
of the land nearly destroyed  
the Indian nation and has  
brought us today to this  
wasteland punctuated by the  
Vietnam war, filthy air and  
water and anomie among our  
people.

Thus, I responded to the  
great beauty of the Indian's  
art and craft. But I wonder  
if the collection is not  
telling me that only the  
darker human passions pre-  
vail and that the rape of  
the American Indian is only  
the white man's first step  
to destruction.

I chose among the wealth  
of the collection several  
objects as the most telling  

symbols of the American  
Indian:

The first is a large,  
wooden bowl sheltered in the  
wingspread of an eagle.  

(Catalogue no. 159, Kwakiutl,  
British Columbia, probably  
late 19th century.) The  
bowl, of carved and painted  

wood, was used at potlatches,  
great ceremonial feasts at  
which the Indians outdid one  
another in giving away mat-  
erial possessions.

The massive bowl rested  
on a 5-foot stand on my  
first visit to the Exhibi-  
tion and attracted great  
attention. The bowl demands  
to be touched. The tactil-  
ity of the object kept the  
harried guards in a state of  
apprehension, and on my  
second visit to the exhibi-  
tion, the great eagle had  
been removed to a place of  
safety, on a shelf about  
12 feet from the floor.

A Sioux girl's dress  
(catalogue no. 341, Sioux  
(Eastern).) provides a most  
ironic footnote to Anglo-  
Indian relations. The soft,  
buckskin garment has a care-  
fully beaded yoke on which  
wave two early American  
flags.

Among the many masks dis-  
played, a Nootkan Human Face  
Mask (Catalogue no. 600,  
Vancouver Island, British  
Columbia) offers the best  
statement of the Indian's  
acceptance of the necessary  
and sometimes horrific hu-  
man relation to the super-  
natural.

The huge head is of  
carved and painted wood,  
covered with luxuriant black  
horsehair, out of which  
stare black eyes made of  
bone and bead. I passed this  
head with a shudder on my  
first visit to the collec-  
tion but on my return felt  
that the eyes of the mask  
represented horror but ulti-  
mate acceptance of mortality.

An Arapaho Ghost Dance  
shirt (Catalogue no. 293) is  
a mute testament to the des-  
peration of the American  
Indian when he was driven  
further and further from his  
home.

After Chief Crazy Horse  
died, the Indian called  
upon his ancestors to return  
and save the Indian from the  
white man. The Indians im-  
portuned their ancestor-  
ghosts with a seven-year  
dance. The Ghost Dance  
Shirt bears the fantastic  
marks of this venture: On  

a ground of blue painted  
buckskin flutter four black  
birds, a tortoise and two  
men on a field of brilliant  
stars.

As I completed my  
second tour of the Exhibi-  
tion, I was struck by the  
grace and gaiety of the  
floral beadwork on an Ojib-  
wa beaded cloth bandoleer  
bag. The delicate coloring  
and graceful intertwining of  
the design display the wood-  
land Indian's intimacy with  
his surroundings.

"American Indian Art:  
Form and Tradition" runs  
through December 31, 1972.  
It is Walker Art Center's  
best show since reopening  
two years ago.

I have two criticisms  
of the Exhibition: The  
numbering and labeling of  
individual art objects are  
extremely difficult to find.  
The labels are grouped on  
walls adjoining each sec-  
tion of the Exhibition rath-  
er than being closely  
attached to each object.  
And the $8.50 charge for  
the Exhibition Catalogue is  
outrageous.

Despite these failings,  
Walker has done a service  
to the community in bring-  
ing us closer to the Amer-  
ican Indian's art and phil-  
osophy, best stated by  
Crowfoot, orator for the  
Blackfoot Confederacy, on  
his deathbed in 1890:

"It  
is the breath of a  
buffalo in the winter  
time. It is the little  
shadow which runs  
across the grass and  
loses itself in the  
sunset."

"American Indian Art: Form  
and Tradition" is a FREE  
Exhibition, although a don-  
ation of 50 cents is sugg-  
ested.

Hill, Young ‘Renegade’ Poet  
Hymns Native American Experience  

by Pat Monahan  

"An old woman said to me,  
they can keep you from being  
a poet, but they can't keep  
you from being a citizen."  
She is Oneida, a member of a  
tribe forcibly removed from  
its New York home and re-  
settled in distant Wiscon-  
sin.  

"I want to go out East  
and find Oneida speakers,  
and apply what I learn to my  
poetry." She does not know  
the language of her herit-  
age.  

"There's a richness to  
Indian languages, sounds,  
rhythms--such a richness--  
all these would enrich con-  
temporary poetry." She  
dresses plainly, speaks with  
a simple earnestness.  

Roberta Hill is young,  
an Indian, a student, a wo-  
man. And she is a poet who  
says, "being an artist means  
giving away part of your own  
self--if you just go along  
with what people tell you,  
with their demands, it  
ceases to be giving."  

"That doesn't mean," she  
hastens to add, "that the  
Indian person--or poet--  
should not be involved" in  
the Indian movement but that  
in her eyes, her art tran-  
scends categories in which  
"your imagination gets  
bound up."  

In Minneapolis this month  
in conjunction with the  
current Walker Art Center  
exhibition of Indian art, Ms.  

Hill shared her poems and  
opinions with participants  
in readings and interviews,  
as well as conducting poet-  
ry classes for inner-city  
schoolchildren.  

A graduate student at the  
University of Montana at  
Missoula, Roberta is com-  
pleting her Master of Fine  
Arts thesis, a book of po-  
etry. She plans, after  
spring graduation, to teach  
creative writing as well as  
continuing her own work.  

Her academic background  
is in psychology, which she  
studied in Wisconsin as  
an undergraduate.  

"I never really thought  
of being, you know, ‘a  
poet,'" Roberta remarks,  
but suggests that this non-  
literary training has all-  
owed her a certain imagistic  
freedom: "I don't worry  
about where the images come  
from, or if I've read it  
somewhere before."  

Encouraged by college  
teachers to develop her  
writing talent, Ms. Hill  
last year entered the cre-  
ative writing program in  
Montana, at a school which  
has a department of Ameri-  
can Indian Studies, empha-  
sizing the visual arts.  

kkk k  

"I've been writing poet-  
ry--well, good poetry, only  
about two years," she says.  

‘voices!"  

Her work has been published  
in poetry journals such as  
Intro, the American Poetry  
Review and Poetry Northwest;  
she is now touring the  
nation to promote exposure  
of contemporary Indian art.  

Roberta Hill asserts  
that she "wants to use  
Indian rhythms in English  
language poetry," but is  
troubled by technique: "If  
only I had four or five  
She cites Simon  
Ortez' experimental use of  
Indian rhythmic forms as a  
successful example of  
this development in Native  
American writing.  

"I am entrapped here,"  
she cries in one poem but  
asserts as well, "I am  
a renegade."  

"There is a lodestone in  
the prairie," she writes,  
invoking in another poem  
“the prairie...where tears  
salt bread." Traditional  
Native American images--  
soapstone, pony heads--  
appear in her poems, aug-  
mented with urban images  
which recall the experience  
of many modern Native Ameri-  
cans.  

"I think you can tell  
when you're laying yourself  
on the line, and when you're  
not," Roberta Hill says of  
the experience of creation.  
"When you are, it's good.  
When you're not, it's not."

Women’s  
Film  
Festi  

The image of women is cru-  
cial, and in the media of  
movies that image is contriv-  
ed into the nun or the whore,  
the mama, or the bitch. The  
film industry has been the  
dominant influence on our  
habits and beliefs. For too  
long, it has projected women  
as sex objects, aggressive  
castrators, passive idiots,  
masochists, and losers.  
"Movies have programmed our  
dreams." We have accepted  
all that for years, and it  
has to be changed!  

But just as movies have  
had the power to perpetuate  
the weak image of women, it  
also has the power to alter  
that image, to change our  
values and influence our i-  
deals. There WILL be a new  
kind of movie--one showing  
women as strong, compassion-  
ate and beautiful inside!  
Now for starters, there will  
be something of a women's  
film festival at St. Mary's  

December 17. It is not as  
complete as I would like it  

15 here in Minneapolis.), but  
there were many factors work-  
ing against it and this is  

1969 USA.  

Anyhow, not all of the films

but what the image is. Eight  
of the films are from this  
year's New York Women's Film  
Festival. Others were en-  
tries in other years. One  

of the films, a short, was  
made by the Minneapolis film-  
maker Susan Kraning.  

There is no reason why  
films made by women have to  
be categorized as such, ex-  
cept that for right now, if  
women won't band together to  
publicize their work, to sup-  
port and exchange ideas with  
one another, to pressure the  
film industry into trusting  
and respecting their talent  
--who will? It is my hope  
that this mini Minneapolis  
film festival will stimulate  
not only feminists', but also  
the general public's appetite  
for more women's films to  
come, that it will encourage  
other commercial theatres to  
discover the feminist aesthe-  
tic and that ultimately the  
film industry will abandon  
all of those horrible stereo-  

types of us. This series is  
a test. Personally, I am on-  

ly interested in breaking  
even in this venture...just  
so that I can show my male  
partners that a women's  
series is NOT risky business.  
I am more than willing to  
turn over any profit to a  
women's group or better yet  
have the money go to setting  
up a women's theatre. These  
are just a few possibilities.

A  
SPECIAL  
BOOKSTORE  

BY NANCY WHISKEY  

I went to my local book-  
store the other day, looking  
for something inspiring to  
read. I passed the shelves  
of Hemingway, Faulkner, F.  
Scott Fitzgerald, Steinbeck,  
yet nothing seemed interest-  
ing. Where, I wondered,  
could I get something written  
by women, movement-conscious  
women? I asked the clerk,  
but all I got was a blank  
look; evidently, he had never  

heard of the movement, let  
alone movement-conscious  
writers. I eventually found  
a small selection, under  
Sociology, of movement books,  
Sisterhood is Powerful, The  
Female Eunuch, The Second  
Sex, The Feminine Mystique.  

I had read parts of The Sec-  
ond Sex, but I was interested  
in current fiction -- easy  
stuff.  

THEN I heard about the Am-  
azon Bookstore. I felt a  
little embarrassed, just  
thinking about the name, but  
I summoned my courage (after  
all, I hadn't chosen the  
name), and found my way to  
3240 Cedar Ave. South. A big  
sign on the house read AMAZON  
BOOKSTORE - FEMINIST LITERA-  
TURE. I was lucky; the store  
had just reopened after being  
closed for the summer.  

Inside, I browsed through  
issues of Aphra, Women-a  
journal of Women’s Studies,  
Up From Under, No More Fun and  
Games. I couldn't decide  
where to start, I was so  
excited. There was a whole  
shelf of books for just bio-  
graphy and autobiography,  
another for fiction. There  
was a table of children's  
books--books where little  
girls are doctors, where  
little boys do the cooking  
with their father. There  
were newspapers (several  
from Lesbian collectives),  
anthologies, too much to  
remember--so I secured an  
annotated bibliography.  

There was also a table of  
back issues and miscellan-  
eous publications--a library  
in a way--and a couch to read  
on. "Joy of Cooking,” Tracy  
Nelson, Buffy St. Marie played  
on the record player.  

The only thing missing was  
coffee. They don't serve  
coffee "because," they said,  
“coffee is an addictive stim-  
ulant." So is their litera-  
ture, I thought, but kept  
silent.

A Very Serious Woman

A Book Review

October 21

Eddie Hebert's (D-La.) bill today was on
pensions for men in the armed services. "I'm
not going to fight you, Eddie," I said.

"You're not?" he said, startled. "What's
got into you, Bella baby?"

"You can have your pensions, Eddie, but no
money for any other military stuff."

"Khrushchev would be happy to hear you say
that."

"Listen, Eddie, I knew you were a devil,
but I didn't know you were that much of a
devil that you could communicate with the
dead."

"Huh?"

"Khrushchev is dead!"

"I mean that other fellow with the 'K'
then."

"Who? Kosygin?"
"Yeah - that's it."

- Jean Wolcott

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN

Whether in or out of the public eye, women
are seldom classed as acceptably interesting
and intelligent people. Either they are seen
as ordinary women, which disqualifies them,
or they are considered to be "characters,"
which plops them into a different, less ver-
satile category. Whichever way they are
identified, they are rarely accorded simple
respect. If women are respected at all, it
is in a confused, qualified way.

When Bella Abzug was elected to the House
of Representatives in 1970, there was never
any doubt in the minds of the press, her con-
stituents, or her new colleagues, that she
was a full-fledged character. Their question
was whether she was anything else, and Bella?
Ms. Abzug Goes to Washington (Saturday Review
Press, 26-95) is the answer.

Abzug begins this diary of her first year
in Congress by flatly stating, "I've been
described as a tough and noisy woman, a
prizefighter, and man-hater, you name it....
There are those who say I'm impatient, impe-
tuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash, and
overbearing.... But whatever I am, I am a very
serious woman."

She spent the rest of her term trying to
prove that energy, personality and femaleness
do not add up to frivolity. Now, thanks to
the fortunate outcome of a reelection jeo-
pardized by an unfortunate redistricting,
Abzug is preparing to give the 93rd Congress
its due dose of her undiluted politics.

In the spring of 1971 to extend the draft:
"This is the first time we've had an oppor-
tunity to vote on the war - or even discuss
withdrawal as an issue."

Abzug's antidote to House inertia was the
almost forgotten "resolution of inquiry,"
which must be acted on within seven working
days. She first used this obscure procedure
to request release of the Pentagon Papers,
and her strategic lead has been followed by
several other activist representatives.

This book is not the work of an artist or
theoretician, and many a demanding feminist
will be disappointed by her discussions of
the child care bill (passed by the House and
Senate, but squashed by Nixon's veto) and of
the Equal Rights Amendment. Abzug's views
are heartening and her anecdotes revealing,
but by themselves, they do not provide a sat-
isfying account of the politicking that went
on during the voting on these issues.

The Author Is No Ghost

But for the most part, Bella attains a
diary's primary objective; it tells what a
period of time was like for one person. Be-
cause this particular person happens to be
a public figure, she is not necessarily ob-
liged to make her diary a sweeping overview
of public affairs. Her main responsibility
is to tell honestly about her part in these
affairs, and this Abzug does undeniably well.

Her account has escaped the usual doctor-
ing and ghostly writing so common in politi-
cal autobiographies. Many of her daily en-
tries begin with exclamations such as "I'm
really exhausted," or "All day I was very up-
tight..." Abzug does not pretend that she
spent most of her time in victorious debate
on the House floor. She was running from
meeting to meeting only to find them both
adjourned for lack of a quorum, she was
halfheartedly trying to erase a campaign
debt, she was fighting off impossible demands
on her time.

Abzug wisely relinquished her opportunity
to popularize herself as a national politi-
cal figure; journalists around the country
have already done that and she knows it. She
merely explains what she has seen, done, won,
lost or wanted. "What the Associated Press
doesn't understand is that I'm not here to
fight about my hats."

What Is A Womanly Committee?

The first major battle her diary chronicles
is her fight for a seat on the Armed Services
Committee. Her chances were slight, since
she was undermining the seniority system and
the unquestioned tradition of appointing
semi-scarce congresswomen to "womanly" com-
mittees such as Education and Labor. When
she received her appointment to the Govern-
ment Operations Committee, Abzug learned that
the way of all politicians is promise....and
then compromise. All politicians, that is,
except Abzug.

Bella tells with breathless immediacy
("It's atrocious") how the House, through
the machinations of various wheels and deals,
spends most of its time and votes avoiding
the issues. Hence the jubilation of anti-
war, liberal congressmen when the House voted

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN

When a new book by-for-or-about-women is launched, feminists around the nation gravitate toward it with friendly eagerness, but almost insatiable, intimidating expectations. Our understanding of Women's Condition is on the borderline between diagnosis and solution. We are hovering between recognition and reconstruction and need but one exact pointer to set us bounding in the right direction.

Maybe it will be a book, a rally, an election, a massive women's union...whatever it will be, we are working and waiting for that joyous push to come.

Women and Madness by Phyllis Chesler (Doubleday, $8.95) now faces such strict, hopeful scrutiny that its chances for success are far outweighed by its chances for near success, which at this point, runs only slightly ahead of mediocrity and sheer failure. The feminist literary market is becoming more experienced and our critical faculties are well-honed. We have had good books; now we want great ones, books that will shatter the world.

Daddy’s Kind Hands Can Hurt

Mental health has long been blessed by hands deeply creased with paternalism. Chesler's book is precisely timed, because women, mad or sane, are just beginning to realize how little those guiding hands have helped them.

Chesler recognizes her burden in her introduction: "In bringing you this book, I feel like a time-traveler turned messenger, a bearer of bad news. I wonder how you will receive it, I wonder what will you do?"

Her message is that there exists a double standard of mental health so rigid that there is not a woman alive who could possibly qualify as normal under it. There are two kinds of sanity, and they are by no means "equal." In unassailable first and foremost place is sanity for adults, that is, for men. In a cozy niche somewhat further down the scale of normality, there resides a compact, neatly wrapped package which is sanity for women.

So women have two kinds of abnormality to choose from. They can behave like women, which makes them abnormal adults; or they can behave like adults (read men), and thus become abnormal women. Either way, most women have within them great potential for long-lasting "psychiatric careers."

That Portable Thin Line

Chesler points out, very effectively, that the difference between sane, acceptable behavior and mad, antisocial behavior on the part of women is often in the eye of the beholder. The line between feminine madness and sanity is not only thin; it is also portable. Just where that line is drawn at any given time often depends on the convenience of those who control a woman's life, usually a husband or parents.

A study of ex-mental patients and ordinary housewives quoted in Women and Madness points out a number of characteristics the two groups share. Husbands and mothers described women in both groups as "making no sense when talking; walking, sitting, or standing awkwardly; moving around restlessly; saying she hears voices; trying to hurt or kill herself; needing help in dressing; being bad-tempered; not knowing what is going on around her; saying she sees people who aren't there."

Yet once she is in the care of a (usually male) psychiatrist or plunged into a mental asylum, a disturbed woman is firmly directed toward traditional feminine behavior. A recent article in Rough Times (formerly The Radical Therapist) reports the experience of a woman who was immediately released from a hospital mental ward when she began wearing a skirt and promised to seek a job with Bell Telephone. Her involuntary admission to the hospital had been based on her reluctance to do these approved feminine things.

Similarly, women in asylums who are not inclined toward sex-stereotyped domestic labor are diagnosed as unwell. Chesler writes, "Those women remanded to state asylums worked as unpaid domestics, laundresses, ward aides, cooks, and commissary saleswomen. If they refused these jobs they were considered 'crazy' and 'uncooperative' and punished with drugs, shock treatments, beatings, mockery, and longer hospital stays. If they accepted these jobs, and performed them well, the hospital staff was often reluctant to let them go."

Women and Madness suggests that an increasing number of women are inextricably involved in psychiatric careers because “they feel, quite horribly, at home within them." A typical career woman is admitted to mental hospitals more often and is retained for longer periods of time than the average male mental patient. This statistic makes inexorable sense, for women cannot help but be confused and irresolute when their cure so closely resembles their malady.

‘Anatomy is history, not destiny’

The last half of the book is comprised of sixty interviews with "mad" women. Chesler divides them into five groups; those who have been sexually involved with their therapist, psychiatrically institutionalized women, lesbians, Third World women, and feminists.

No paraphrase of these interviews can convey the bristling energy of some or the limpid piteousness of others. They must be read verbatim, which is one reason why women everywhere in the English-speaking world should search out this book. The rest of the world's women must wait until it is translated.

Women and Madness fairly billows with great gusts of fear and promise, yet it does not quite fulfill the anticipation its opening chapters arouse. Chesler's concluding discussion of Amazon society and her psychological prescriptions are too general to lead psychiatric career women to the realm of genuine good health. I suspect that most of this vagueness stems from her hesitancy to prescribe feminism as a miracle cure. But she will not have written the breakthrough book we await until this indecision is resolved in a second volume.

As a time-traveler, Phyllis Chesler brings bad news from the past with dazzling boldness and accuracy. I hope she can do as well with good news from the future.

If there's one thing that Sagittarians find impossible --and it's maybe the only thing they'll admit as even difficult--it's refraining from speech when they've an opinion. And as they've opinions on well-nigh everything, the December-born are reminded of this failing frequently.  

And, because their sex is categorized as subtle and devious, it's many a Sagittarian woman who's uttered a silent (or more likely, audible) curse at her frankness. Like when she's found just the right curt words to handle a compromising situation. Or when someone attempted an intellectual put-down--and she responded, ignoring the intent, as though to a challenge.  

These occasional disruptions can ruffle her optimistic surface. But more destructive, in the long run, is the individualistic Sagittarian's conviction of inborn nobility: because she is herself so capable, (despite her lapses, or because of them) she is impatient with those who crumple under strain. She believes in the "bootstraps" theory of social improvement, which possibly only works for Sagittarians and a random Capricorn.  

Sagittarian idealism, then, is individual rather than social; the archer seeks her ideal embodied in individuals and may be hesitant to extend this idealism to utopian social thought. She holds high standards for herself but narrows her viewpoint to personal development alone.  

Given her own potential for such development, her focus is understandable;

herbs  
Throw away the patent panaceas and stock your shelves instead with these simple herbs:  

HOPS, taken as a mild tea, is a quick-acting soporific; the dried herb, stuffed into a pillow, is said to induce sleep as well.  

SAGE, a familiar seasoning, is considered a tonic and blood-purifier; as a hair rinse, the tea reputedly removes dandruff.  

GINSENG is a stimulant which, as a strong tea, is euphoric as well; YERBA MATE is very stimulating and said to diminish the appetite.  

ROSEHIPS are a concentrated source of vitamin C and are therefore prescribed for the common cold.  

WILLOW BARK contains the substance from which aspirin is derived; it is a natural pain reliever.  

VALERIAN is both a sedative and a stimulant; it is useful in minor nervous conditions in which sleep is not sought.  

The Women's Herbal Collective--dedicated to restoring to women knowledge of simple efficacious remedies for minor illnesses--suggests these common herbs as an introduction into the field of practical herbalism.

| Am An American Girl  

I am an American girl.  
I have seen the growth of this nation.  
I have seen your ‘home of the brave and land of the free'  
I have known of Hiroshima, the Korean War, the Bay of Pigs,  
Biafra, and now Vietnam.  
I have known the innocent bloodshed in Selma, Jackson, and  
on my own streets.  
I have seen your cars and skyscrapers.  
I have walked 29 miles for development.  
I have known the deaths of Malcolm, Martin, John, Robert  
and Bobby.  
I have tasted a million endless tears for a people so  
crushed and discriminated.  
I have carried guilt on my white skin and denied myself.  
I have seen man walk on the moon and heard the sonic barrier  
broken.  
I have seen millions of dollars spent on beautifying  
America.  
I have seen the destruction and pollution of water, air  
and land.  
I have seen your growth in cities.  
I have seen men dead on the same streets.  
I have known the creation of your drugs and synthetic  
escapes.  
I have felt the emptiness of insanity from the same.  
I have seen the rise and decline of tenement houses, only  
to be replaced by more.  
I have seen the bombing of a church in Alabama.  
I have known the deaths of three small children.  
I have lived in roach and rat infested slum houses.  
I have been told Russia will bury me.  
I have cried ten thousand tears for starving children in  
Appalachia.  
I have hungered countless times with my Indian children on  
barren reservations.  
I have felt the pain of hearing my son called nigger.  
I have felt the taunts and cruelty of your America.  
I have bowed to you in silence, white America.  
I have cried a thousand right-ons to Angela Davis.  
I have wept endless tears for Connie Trimble.  
I have slept behind steel bars and played your ridiculous  
games, America.  
I have cried too often, and yet you wonder why I am as I am.  
I am no longer going to cry.  
I am no longer going to cry.  

For I am no longer,  

an American girl.

sister in jail  
I too wait  
sister in jail  
I too burn  
sister in jail  
I too grow  
embittered  
sister in jail  
I too grow  
enraged and  
angered  
But that's all bullshit when  
What you need is  
money  
Because even the best  
shit  
won't deliver  
you  
from this  
concocktion.  
tears begin to run rampantly  
down my face  
as I realize  
they're merely forcing us  
to buy you  
off the market  
like a  
slave  
to free you  
In all their damned blindness  
they can't sense  
that  
you're  
sacred  
black sister  
as sacred as  
the  
first  
rain

Job in 'Nam  

Need a job man  
Then see Uncle Sam  
For a job in Viet Nam  

He'll pay the fare  

And even fly you there  

You get free food & medical  
care  

Of course you may come back  
in a box  

And the cause won't be  
chicken pox  

Nor from the holes in your  
socks  

But what do you care  

You get a free trip there  

And even free post mortem  
care  

So if you need a job man  
Go see Uncle Sam  
For a job in Viet Nam.
