UNION WOMEN

The Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) was
formed in Chicago in March 1974. CLUW's pur-
poses are to pursue political and legislative
action in the workplace and stronger representation
of women in union leadership. A CLUW organ-
izational meeting will be held June 6 at

7:30 p.m. at the United Electrical Hall,

3039 Central Ave. N.E. in Minneapolis. This
will be an opportunity for Twin Cities women
to learn about the Chicago convention and to
discuss issues concerning union women. All
bona fide union women are urged to attend.

ASSOCIATION

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO CALIFORNIA TO
LEARN HOW TO DO YOUR OWN DIVORCE.

Right here in Minnesota, over 400
people last year divorced themselves
without the use of lawyers and saved
themselves over $150,000.

If your marriage is dead and you're
about to get a divorce, call on us and
learn how to bury your dead marriage as
quietly as possible. You owe it to
your children and yourself to get back
to the business of living as quickly as
possible, by either saving your mar-
riage or separating peaceably.
