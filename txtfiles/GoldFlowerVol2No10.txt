A DIVINE COMEDY .......

I hear lots of men saying  
there's no humor in the wo-  
men's movement. They seem  
to think that when a woman  
becomes a feminist, she for-  
gets how to laugh.  

That propaganda is another  
boring example of male opaci-  
ty and American double-think.  
It is, in fact, the women's  
movement that allows us to  
laugh. Men who mourn the  
dearth of humor are too dense  
to know when they're being  
laughed at.  

In the old days before the  
second wave, women had one  
alternative to choose from in  
responding to her situation:  
insanity. Thinking women did  
go insane: Sylvia Plath at  
one extreme, and women who  
resigned themselves to the  
quiet madness of everyday  
life at the other. Psycholo-  
gists still accord qualities  
of an unbalanced person to a  
"normal woman"—dependence,  
weakness. Now, the women's  
movement encourages a second  
alternative: laughter.  

Humor lies in the incongru-  
ity of situations. During a  
recent TV documentary on H.L.  
Mencken the narrator said,  
"Sally's (the college English  
professor Mencken married) in-  
telligence was very real—but  
so was her femininity!" Some  
jokes, such as the poster of  
Golda Meir entitled "But can  
she type?" take a sadly com-  
mon situation and carry its  
incongruity one step further  
into humor. Everyone knows  
women who hold master's deg-  
rees plus years of experience  

But can she type?  

who are stuck in secretarial  
positions. The joke about  
the want ad requesting a per-  
son who can walk on water and  
type 60 words per minute is  
by now an old one. Perhaps  
if males do not think those  
jokes are funny it is because  
they see no incongruity in  
those situations; after all,  
drudge work is woman's natur-  
al domain no matter how qual-  
ified she is.  

“Hire him.  
He’s got great legs.”  

Sometimes feminist humor  
ridicules situations common  
to women. By placing a male  
in a woman's situation, we  
see how ludicrous the situa-  

tion is. For example, the  
"Hire him. He's got great  
legs." poster. A similar ex-  

ample was aired on the Mary  
Tyler Moore show recently.  
Resident oaf Ted Baxter wore  
a pair of platform shoes  
which gave him a precarious  
and awkward walk. The scene  
was the funniest of the whole  
show. I wonder how many peo-  
ple realized that it's just  
as ridiculous for women to  
wear such handicapping cloth-  
es—and by extension, dress-  
es, girdles (I saw an ad for  
girdles the other day, so I  
assume some women still wear  
them!) and to practice such  
self-mutilation as shaving  
and eyebrow-tweezing.  

"If Michelangelo had been  
a girl, her mother might have  
said, 'You draw nicely, dear.  
Now wash the shirts, give the  
baby his dinner, and sweep  
the kitchen for me, there's  
a good girl.'"  

Laughter is Powerful  

Men know the power of laugh-  
ter and have used it against  
women for centuries, making  
us ashamed of things to which  
no shame should be attached  
to keep us insecure and pow-  
erless. They made us ashamed  
of being strong, of being in-  
dependent, of having hair un-  
der our arms. Now that we  
have self-respect, we no long  
er laugh at those things. We  
do not admire the self-depre-  
cation of Lucille Ball, but  
turn rather to Lily Tomlin,  
who only does characters who  
like and respect themselves.  

Laughter is used as a wea-  
pon in the women's movement,  
too, to strip men of that mys-  
tical aura of power with  
which they surround themselv-  
es. A group of women talked  
recently about the difficulty  
of getting jobs, the insin-  
cerity of the business world,  
the way revealing one's true  
self would preclude any pos-  
sibility of employment. The  
discussion generated into a  
hilarious listing of "How not  
to get a job." The ideas  
ranged from wearing jeans to  
the interview to revealing  
one's involvement in radical  
feminism, each suggestion  
funnier and truer than the  
last. Finally a quiet woman  
said, "Just take a copy of  
Lesbian Nation with you to  
the interview—you'd never  
get hired!"  

This comment would not be  
funny if it were not based on  
some very tragic facts: the  
stifling conformity of busi-  
ness and the blanket practice  
of discrimination against  
gays.  

On the other hand, this  
joke makes us forget for a  
moment the excessive power  
personnel recruiters wield  
and puts them into proper per-  
spective. You can't help  
seeing, in your mind's eye,  

a self-important, blue-suited  
male, mouth open, eyes roll-  
ing, and for once, speechless.  

And finally, if men cannot  
see beyond their usually sim-  
ple-minded and often cruel  
definitions of humor to the  
more mature women's humor, I  
must remind them that the  
women's movement was born of  
a truly unhappy situation.  

It is a serious attempt to  
eradicate unnecessary misery  
from human life. There is  
nothing funny about being  
oppressed.”

The National Black Feminist  
Organization held its first  
meeting in New York City in  
December. The information  
below expresses viewpoints  
from that conference.  

Statement  
of Purpose  

The distorted male-dominated  
media image of the Women's  
Liberation Movement has  
clouded the vital and revol-  
utionary importance of this  
movement to Third World wo-  
men, especially Black women.  
The Movement has been char-  
acterized as the exclusive  
property of so-called "white  
middle class" women and any  
Black women seen involved in  
this movement have been seen  
as "selling out," "dividing  
the race" and an assortment  
of nonsensical epithets.  
Black Feminists resent these  
charges and have therefore  
established THE NATIONAL  
BLACK FEMINIST ORGANIZATION,  
in order to address ourselves  
to the particular and speci-  
fic needs of the larger, but  
almost cast aside half of the  
Black race in Amerikka, the  
Black Woman.  

Black women have suffered  
cruelly in this society from  
living the phenomenon of  
being Black and female, in a  
country that is both racist  
and sexist. There has been  
very little real examination  
of the damage it has caused  
on the lives and on the minds  
of Black women. Because we  
live in a patriarchy, we have  
allowed a premium to be put  
on Black male suffering. No  
one of us would minimize the  
pain or hardship or the cruel  
and inhumane treatment ex-  
perienced by the Black man.  
But history, past or present,  
rarely deals with the mali-  

cious abuse put upon Black  
women. We were seen as  
breeders by the master; de-  
spised and historically po-  
larized from/by the master's  
wife; and looked upon as  
castrators by our lovers and  
husbands. The Black woman  

has had to be strong, yet we  
are persecuted for having  

survived. We have been  
called "matriarchs" by white  
racists and Black nation-  
alists; we have virtually no  
positive self-images to vali-  
date our existence. Black  
women want to be proud, dig-  
nified and free from all  
those false definitions of  
beauty and womanhood that  
are unrealistic and unnatur-  
al. We, not white men or  
Black men, must define our  
own self-image as Black wo-  
men and not fall into the  
mistake of being placed upon  
the pedestal—which is even  
being rejected by white wo-  
men. It has been hard for  
Black women to emerge from  
the myriad of distorted imag-  
es that have portrayed us as  
grinning Beulahs, castrating  
Sapphires and pancake box  
Jemimahs. As Black Femin-  
ists we realized the need to  
establish ourselves as an  
independent Black Feminist  
organization. Our above  
ground presence will lend  
enormous credibility to the  
current Women's Liberation  
Movement, which unfortunate-  

The Myth of Black  

Starting Toward A  

ly is not seen as the  

serious political and econom-  
ic revolutionary force that  
it is. We will strengthen  
the current efforts of the  
Black Liberation struggle in  
this country by encouraging  
all of the talents and crea-  
tivities of Black women to  
emerge, strong and beautiful,  
not to feel guilty or divisive,  
and assume positions of  
leadership and honor in the  
Black community. We will  
encourage the Black communi-  
ty to stop falling into the  
trap of the white male Left,  
utilizing women only in terms  
of domestic or servile needs.  
We will continue to remind  
the Black Liberation Movement  
that there can't be libera-  
tion for half the race. We  
must together, as a people,  
work to eliminate racism from  
without the Black community  
which is trying to destroy us  
as an entire people, but we  
must remember that sexism is  
destroying and crippling us  
from within.

New Tomorrow

Audrey Colom Speaks  
To Minnesota Women’s  
Political Caucus  

BY SHIRLEY HEYER  

Audrey Colom, vice chair of the National  
Women's Political Caucus, spoke on the “Myth  
of Black Women and Feminism," at the annual  
meeting of the Minnesota Women's Political  
Caucus at Hamline University Nov. 17.  

"Feminist issues are clearly relevant to  
us," she said. "Our double jeopardy--based  
on sex and race--places us at the bottom.  

"For example, the annual median income for  
individuals places black women at the  
bottom, white women third, black males sec-  
ond, and white males at the top."  

In the struggle for equal rights, she  
said, "We need to avoid the 'd&c' (divide  
and conquer) tactic.  

"The civil rights movement and the femin-  
ist movement are addressing the white male  
club--with all women and minority men at the  
bottom. We, all women and minority men, are  
the majority in this country."  

The “myth” of black women and feminism,  
Ms. Colom said, is caused largely by false  
stereotypes, many of which are perpetuated  
by the media. These stereotypes are, she  
said:  

1) trying to "divide our loyalties.  

Telling us that we are black first and  
women second, or as Margaret Sloan, black  
feminist from Chicago, said, ‘That means on  
Mondays through Wednesdays they'll mess you  
over because you're female and Thursdays  
through Sundays they'll mess you over be-  
cause you're black."  

2) "the women's movement is a middle-class  
movement. Some of us accept the stereotype  
that the women's liberation movement is  
‘middle-class women trying to escape the  
home.' We don't need to be liberated to escape  
the home. Work in the home and child care  
are valid. Who says liberation is getting  
up at five, taking care of the family, going  
to a job and then coming home to take care  
of the family again? This is not women's  
liberation."  

3) "the black woman's place is behind her  
man, pushing him into his manhood. ...32%  
of black families are headed by women.  
Where are the men they are supposed to push  
into manhood? Don't lay the emasculation of  
black men on us black women. Bobby Seale  
said, 'Real manhood is not the subjugation  
of anyone.'"  

4) "this is a white/racist women's move-  
ment. A media cliché. The women's movement  
is actually as diverse as the black movement  
is. Just as there are sexists in the black  
liberation movement, there are racists in  
the women's liberation movement.  

"We need the Coalitions, such as the one  
between the Urban Coalition and NOW in the  
boycott against General Mills, or the action

MWPC's "Minority  
Women’s Workshop Resolution  

Minority women agree that their economic  
and social status in American society dic-  
tate that an unrelenting focus and all pos-  
sible energies be directed toward employ-  
ment, education, prison reform, breaking the  
welfare cycle, the best of comprehensive  
day care facilities and personnel, unfair  
percentage of conscription into armed  
services all contribute toward their snail-  
like pace toward gaining their fair share of  
goods and services for their families, com-  
munities and themselves. Although they  
agree that the general goals of the MWPC are  
laudable and necessary to improve the gener-  
al status of women, they feel that their  
focus on the above concerns, with the help  
of majority women in the caucus and certain-  
ly the approval of the MWPC Steering Commit-  
tee will help promote these basic necessi-  
ties. Further, it will gain greater support  
from their minority sisters who remain cool  
toward MWPC activities and all other current  
women's movements.  

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that a Task Force  
be established for all of the minority cul-  
tures, chaired by the minority women's work-  
shop discussion leader, to begin attacking  
the problems identified by the panel of  
minority women.  

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the ten individ-  
uals who signed up for the minority task  
force be the official base for developing  
sensitivity in MWPC toward:  

1) more visibility on panels, conferences,  
etc. throughout Twin Cities, suburbs and  
state;  

2) more reflection of minority women in  
MWPC literature (except for the YWCA, always  
seems to picture faces of the white women);  

3) development of skills bank of minority  
women;  

4) consciousness-raising efforts directed  
toward dispelling myths and prejudices held  
by both majority and minority women; and  

5) alleviating the threat minority males  
feel toward the women's movement as they are  
just beginning to fill new economic  
positions, but still encouraging minority  
women to develop and pursue individual  
creativity.  

Chisholm which passed the new—now-vetoed—  
federal minimum wage bill.  

5) “we black women must get serious. A  
recent nationally held Black Women's Caucus  
charged $50 for registration" and there were:  
complaints. And, frequently we criticize  
the women's liberation movement for high  

confusing racism and classism. -52% of  
blacks are in the middle class. ALL POOR  
women are affected by high registration  
fees."  

6) "non-participation. We must take  
offices. We must decide that the goals of  
the women's movement are our goals. We  
better get in there and work for ourselves  
and our sisters."  

7) “we see white women as members of  
white society. The role of white women  
has been defined in a racist society. Some  
fear white women will take the place of  
white men. This is based on a media stereo-  
type. Rather, the women's movement wants  
the elimination of the oppression. We can-  
not attack one prejudice while ignoring  
others. I have found that the women oppos-  
ing school busing also oppose change in  
women's roles.  

"The first wave of the women's liberation  
movement was the battle for the abolition  
of slavery. It could never have been won  
without the coalition of the women's move-  
ment with the anti-slavery movement. When  
the right to vote came with the 15th amend-  
ment, black women were left out in the cold  
with white women."  

8) "the personal. There is no indictment  
of black women/white males while condemning  
black males/white females. White sexual  
partners are acceptable for black females,  
but not for black males. Power doesn't come  
from your extemporaneous relationships with  
black women or with white women. There is  
a new role for black women in both the civil  
rights movement and the women's liberation  
movement and that is to build bridges, links  
in the HUMAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT.”  

Ms. Colom concluded her speech with a poem  
from Toni Cade's "The Black Woman, An Antho-  
logy," which ended, "'White womanhood is two  
enslaved; the difference is degree.'"

FROM THE REAR

(A TRULY ORGANIC ACCUMULATION)  
by Monica Manning  

A naked woman laying on her side showing large curvy hips, long legs split from not touching and a sphere in her crotch caught my eye. The sphere held  

New York City and the woman had a smile on her lovely face. A sense of admiration swelled within me as I continued to stare at the drawing performed with red ink and black felt tip pen. Ah, the walls of women's rooms never cease to amaze me. I spotted this particular drawing at the Black Forest Inn along with memorable verse such as,  
'Fuck Indians  
that's what whites  
have done  
to Indians for a long time  
sisters unite  
brothers let's fuck  
what about the  
Wounded Knee Indians?'  
Flash, flash - the awareness of words on bathroom walls.  

I remember a time I was placated upon the toilet in that place. The walls were sterile white with fresh paint. I  

was not only constipated, but mortified in my search for something to read because there was nothing. As I reached for the T.P. I noticed a scrawl. My mortification turned to gratification as I read 'what happened to all my  

reading material?' That satiated me like a good grunt... bringing to mind another public bathroom.  

In July of 1973 on a hopping Friday evening I wandered into the Dibbo Hotel on Main Street in Hudson, Wisconsin to hear a friend play music. Time was about 7:30 p.m. as I entered the can to make my bladder gladder. The walls were barren so I made my way to  

the bar. There was a smoky aura out there but I stayed true and listened to the music. Round about closing time (1:00 a.m.) I ventured back into the head finding the walls plastered with jabberwocky. Since I was hassled by the local police to get my rear in gear I didn't have time to read it all so I took note of the biggest boldest writing which was glaring on the door leading out. DEAD NIGGERS SUCK. Such was the consciousness of the Dibbo. My friend got sick on the way home.  

Seems to me that women's poddies have been the place to let it all hang out. Brenners Pub is a good example.  

'Lesbians! women unite, Gay  

is good.  

Love is what you feel not who  
The hanging it out leads to the getting it out in terms of thoughtful retorts like 'I don't know about the rest of you chicks but I really groove on my husband! (That's so incredible Fuck forever!) (Yeah I think he's pretty good too)' or 'Why do all these good gay women write on anonymous bathroom walls? I wish I could meet you all/ Lesbian love is beautiful... if it's so beautiful then why is it on a wall?)  

I wonder if Venus kept herself above arousal or did she merely rain her assessments downward as a lady cleaning a toilet may lift her eyes to the mixture of madness gushing forth a streamlined flush of mastered manure mixing feces with faces.  

Once when I was sipping hot cider in the Riverside Cafe the natural urge got to me so I strolled through the kitchen to a communal toilet. The surrounding walls were confining but not the writing. 'Rejoice Sisters  

God is a beautiful  

black lesbian'  

retort and he's dead!'  

I checked out the same walls today and found a new retort. 'It's true It's true but she's been beat up by a cop and strapped down in a mental hospital, and put down, put down by vicious, whiter, classier straighter females (sisters?). What to say but overloading. shit make big pile. Don't settle for Granny Goose while Old Dutch is around.  

On and on and on roll the graffiti. Spaced womb make for babe's cry (mynese proverb). If Dulcinea wasn't a man's dream would she be? Womenstration is coming! Ah, the orgasms abounding from women's writings in women's spaces are fetching.

THE HOUSE OF ELIMA

BY MARY ELLEN SHAW

HE SAYS: There haven't been any women of  
real genius.

SHE SAYS: You never see the mountain rising  
up behind your back.

"Elima" is a new magazine of poetry, jour-  
nals and reviews edited by Annie Gottlieb.  
An elima, she explains, is a house in a  
pygmy tribe set aside for the young girl/  
woman just unfolding into maturity. All of  
the women in the village, old and young,  
join together to sing and celebrate; the old-  
er women teaching lessons of an adult life.  
"Day after day, night after night, the elima  
house resounds with the throaty contralto of  
the older women and the high, piping voices  
of the youngest. It is a time of gladness  
and happiness, not for the women alone but  
for the whole people."

In “Elima," the same singing, the same  
unfolding takes place. The women writers  
speak from different backgrounds and decades:

. practiced poets of vision and sparse words;  
young poets raising up words like torches;  
women exploring the fragments of their  
childhoods and collisions with society.  
“Elima" incorporates journals, letters,  
poems and sympathetic quotes from estab-  
lished (male) literature. The magazine em-  
phasizes communicating what the experience  
of women has been, experimenting and prob-  
ing new ways of writing, and the process of  
fully-sexed, adult and potent.

In future issues, I would like to see some  
variety in format. The typesetting is  
blocked and unvaried, not inviting immediate  
or easy access. Another thing to look for-  
ward to is the tightening up of style. Work  
which is a beginning and exploration is nec-  
essary, but can't be kept up forever. If it  
were, it might put the magazine in that un-  
comfortable position so familiar to women's  
work, i.e., as an auxiliary and interesting  
sideline, but nothing to be taken seriously.  
There is a danger, on one hand, in bending  
too far to outside pressure, thus losing vi-  
tality and originality. But there is a  
greater danger, on the other hand, in not being  
as tough and demanding toward each other  
as the world will be.

There is an earthiness about much of the  
work, a focus, contact with the landscape on  
intimate, if sometimes brutal, terms. Tex-  
tures, plant life, paints, pots, glass, me-  
tal, body, animal. A child in Mexico with  
ulcerated eyes. The reality of bare walls  
in a New York prison cell, and the real wo-  

men who talked and fought and loved and  
lived there.

The journal fragments are personal and un-  
selfconscious. Each of them transfers a per-  
sonality, a person; someone known from years  
of late night word-fests; or that familiar  
voice in every woman's mind which tallies  
lists of betrayals and confusion. There is  

a concern with girlhood, of recreating the  

past to see what was forced, wheedled and  
conned; what was wasted and thrown away;  
what might have been possible.

Each poet gives us a handful of her voice.  
Styles and concerns vary, and there is a de-  
liberate range of deftness and facility.

Juli Loesch is flamboyant, outre, right-on  
and gentle:

Opened by a mailed fist  

on the carapace  
Opened by a  
tender craziness  
We open and open  

Roa Lynn has a terse, finely-sharpened  
bitterness, and she, too, is gentle:

So over the years  

The whole female world fragilely falls  

Into two groups, those that have, and  
those that haven't  

Got the courage to pierce their ears; a  
little American girl  

From Pittsburgh unexpectedly thrust her  
freckled cheek forward.

April Murphy speaks body-talk and cele-  
brates the rarely spoken-of phenomenon of  
active female sexuality:

lithe animal of my center, playful as an  

otter with her inside-out body.

Carol Muske speaks with a bony vividness.  
She uses images in a private, almost mythic  
vision:

My body moves bladelike through mirrors  

My head turns, a spool winding down  

To the last great ring of bone at the  

throat.

In this dark season  

I have grown a rough coat for winter  
Feel my hand budding with hardware  
My sweet smile  

Moving quiet through stone  

Like a new species.

There is a review of "Women and Madness."  
Marge Piercy is the reviewer; she is urgent  
and a bit frightening: what is being built/  
born/explored has to be done for survival.  
"Women can't yet believe we can be enhanced  
and protected by the achievements of any  
other women." "Women must feed one another  
emotionally, sexually, and intellectually,  
must support one another if the loser's  
cycle is to be broken.

I'm not sure absolute retreat and exile  
are necessary, but there is surely a need  
for a time of withdrawal and renewal. The  
house of elima is a good place to start;  
trading stories and songs, sharing harsh  
lessons if necessary, learning the duties  
and joyous freedom of maturity. A sounding  
out, a stretching, a testing begins here, as  
well as a ripening sense of community.

Before the door opens, the house of elima  
will rock and rock with laughter and song -  
and loud anger. And when the door does  
open, we will emerge in strength with full  
hands.

Sally Hughes Makes Student  
Government ‘Women’s Work’  

I've grown accustomed to positing all my  
hopes for female equality and a humane soc-  
iety in terms of a very distant future.  
Indeed, I've grown rather sour on occasion  
when I concede that only the dust of my sis-  
ters and I will witness a feminist/human  
millennium.  

But in the midst of my latest pessimism, I  
met Sally Hughes, who is a living measure of  
the progress women have made in the past 10  
years.  

She is a freshman at Metropolitan Commun-  
ity College, its first female Student Senate  
President and a leader of a late-February  
student protest against poor facilities and  
an unresponsive administration.  

Breach of the Peace  

In that protest, Sally was arrested for  
"breach of the peace" and "placing injurious  
materials in the streets."  

My interest was piqued at the outset—un-  
accustomed as I am to newspaper photos of  
young women being hauled off by police as  
leaders of protests. And upon reading the  
"Minneapolis Tribune's" account of the dem-  
onstration, so much remained unsaid that I  
phoned Sally for an interview.  

She readily agreed and a day later I  
arrived at Metropolitan's Memorial Hall,  
a building whose WPA drabness has been only  
slightly relieved by neo-psychedelic wall  
colors.  

I presented myself at the basement-level  
Student Senate office, expecting to find one  
or two students at their leisure. But I  
walked into a working organization's office.  

Seven or eight men and women were gathered  
around a desk and I caught conversational  
tailings: "...I told him we'd completed  
that..." "I've set up a meeting with them  
on Monday..." "The parking lot's been  
taken care of...."  

In another corner of the room two young  
women removed scarves and gloves and attend-  
ed to an infant.  

I realized I had encountered people ser-  
iously involved in their work and, conscious  
of my interruption, asked for Sally Hughes.  

"She's right there..." indicating the wo-  
man holding the baby.  

She gave the child to her sister and led  
me to the quietest corner of the office.  

Sally is tall and sturdily slender, her  
long, ash-brown hair hangs straight. She  
speaks directly and naturally.  

"There has been a real communication ga-  
p between the administration and students,"  

by Mary Hastings  

she said, explaining the basis of last  
month's protest.  

To dramatize their plight, 30 to 40 stu-  
dents gathered in front of the college be-  
fore dawn on February 1.  

Sally and the other demonstrators handed  
out informational leaflets and dragged sev-  
eral of the cafeteria's uncomfortable-look-  
ing table-stool units onto the walks to  
illustrate their claims of poor facilities.  

Police arrived shortly after the demonstra-  
tion began. "At first they were directing  
traffic out of the area," Sally explained.  

“Swooped Up”  

But when the tables and stools appeared, a  
struggle ensued.  

"We had a lot more participation once  
the police came," Sally said. Evidently the  
police recognized her as a central figure  
in the demonstration.  

"I heard them yell, 'Get her.' It was  

‘really strange the way they swooped me up."  

and Arrested  

She was the only student arrested. She  
has retained an attorney to defend her and,  

at this writing, is scheduled to appear in  
court.  

However, Sally said she understood that  
Metropolitan's president, Howard Bergstrom,  
would negotiate with the District Attorney  
to drop charges against her. Bergstrom will

Hughes, continued

state that the demonstration was a college
matter, not a civil issue.

Sally has been Student Senate president
since the resignation of former president,
Tim McHie.

She ran for the Senate presidency to bring
unity to the school and to get us better
facilities."

She explained that Metropolitan has "very
serious space problems." (The school has
an enrollment of 2,600 students, about half
part-time. The college uses six buildings.
But one is the library and the other is
McPhail Center, which also rents space to
the University of Minnesota.)

Resignation and
Day-Care --Top Priorities

Sally showed me a list of student demands,
arranged according to priority.

The first was the resignation of Bergstrom
(He has resigned, effective July 1; he
said his timing was "embarrassing" but co-
incidental).

“We want a day-care center on campus," she
continued. Day-care is the students' second
priority concern, despite the media's fas-
cination with a request for an integrated
restroom in the commons area.

"The administration has been working on a
day-care center for three years," Sally

In response to the protesters' de-
mands, Bergstrom sent the State Board
(which governs Metropolitan) a
"strongly worded statement" in support of
on-campus day-care.

The students also demanded that the
only parking lot run on a first-come-first-
served basis. Bergstrom had allowed about
one-third of the lot to be cordoned off
and reserved for faculty and staff but has
agreed to accommodate the students' request.

(Other than the very small school parking
lot, the only parking I noticed were metered
areas bordering Loring Park.)

Among the students' other demands were:

Partial tuition refunds. (At
present students get no refund
if they drop a course mid-
quarter or drop below a full
course load.)

"The only way we can get any
tuition refund is to withdraw
from school," Sally noted.

Student input into all major
college decisions.

More suitable tables in the
cafeteria and commons area.

Research into eligibility re-
quirements of the National
Junior College Athletic Assoc-
iation and an integrated lab-
oratory in the commons area.

The students also demanded
that charges against Sally be
dropped.

The fact that so many of the demands had
been met within 24 hours of the demonstra-
tion speaks well for the Senate's organiz-
ation and efficiency.

Woman-Power

Sally pointed out that this year all Sen-
ate officers, with one exception, are wo-
men. Indeed, the school as a whole appears
congenial to women.

The college newspaper, "Metropolitan
Journal," has its first woman editor this
year, Sherry Strong.

"Metropolitan has the first women's stud-
ies program among the state's community col-
leges," Sally said.

The program has been operating for a year
under the tutelage of two female faculty
members and offers two courses a quarter:
“Women in the 70's“ and “Advanced Critical
Readings."

Several of the women in the Senate off-
ice agreed that "there are a lot of Metro-
politan women involved in outside women's
groups," although the college has not yet
started its own women's group.

As impressive as the heightened conscious-
ness of Metropolitan's women was the coop-
eration evident between men and women in
the Student Senate office. The women were
obviously very much in charge of themselves
and the men accorded them the easy respect
and camaraderie that flourishes between
equals.

That atmosphere allayed my pessimism at
least temporarily. Feeling positive, I
study the photograph below: There is vio-
lence in it, which I deplore, but there is

Taking Your Chances

by Susan Cushman

When I was growing up my father had a ram-
rod policy about young women and travel. He
combined the interests of respectability and
safety in his edict that my sisters and I
could not travel alone or with female
friends because that was dangerous. We also
could not travel with male friends for fear
of losing our real or figurative virginity.
In short, trips were to be made with our
parents or not at all.

Many parents enforced similar stifling
rules which drastically curtailed our young
movements. Colleges and universities fol-
lowed the parental lead in establishing
hours for women while the men did as they
liked. “In the small midwestern town where
I was in undergraduate school, the dean of
women warned us many times about the "tran-
sient perverts" who unaccountably stalked
the cornfields. She advised us to have es-
corts after sundown, yet for four years I
took a nightly walk expressly for the soli-
tude, without encountering anything more
than an occasional overzealous dog.

It took a few months in a truly dangerous
city (St. Louis) for me to realize that
these authority figures had been right about
one thing - women are favorite targets of
most crimes. The question is what to do
about it. Each individual, it seems, must
find a comfortable balance between personal
safety and personal freedom. If the danger
is greater for a given group of people, the
freedom must apparently shrink to maintain
comparable survival odds.

A recently published book supports this
conclusion while at the same time offering
some useful suggestions for increasing fe-
male safety without seriously limiting li-
berty. "Lady Beware" by Peter Arnold (Dou-
bleday, 182 pages, $5.95) is written in a
somewhat annoying fashion, frequently speci-
fying times when a woman is alone as times
when "your man" is away. Nevertheless, the
book is valuable because it explicitly des-
cribes crimes against women and possible
preventative measures.

Some of these measures, such as installing
effective locks, can be taken infrequently
and require just one burst of determination
and concern. Others necessitate a change in
daily habits. Arnold presents everyday ways
of carrying a purse so as to discourage
purse snatchers, leaving an apartment so as
to discourage burglars, and walking so as to
discourage prospective muggers or rapists.

Perhaps the most helpful advice comes from
convicted men who describe their selective
attitudes when choosing victims. In many
cases the enticing combination is solitude
and preoccupation - a woman alone who does
not appear to be paying attention to her
surroundings. By making herself an easy
mark, a woman seemingly invites the most
simplistic and even half-hearted crimes.

The solution, of course, is not to cower
indoors with a cadre of male protectors.
Rather, each woman should analyze the way
she lives and then make that particular way
as safe as possible. If you frequently walk
at night, you'll be safer if you carry a po-
lice whistle. If you get around mostly by
car, it's a good idea to check the back seat
floor before you get in and to keep your
doors locked while driving to protect your-
self from unwanted passengers. Habits like
these improve your safety without interfer-
ing with your movements or compromising your
independence.

If you do suspect that someone is sizing
you up in an unfriendly manner, don't be re-
luctant to do something about it before you
are proved right. Policewomen who were
interviewed in "Lady Beware" agree that most
women who are attacked have a premonition
of danger but don't do anything about it.
Alertness doesn't help if women don't act
decisively on their perceptions. Stepping
into a lighted store or out of an uncomfor-
tably intimate elevator won't implicate a
possibly innocent person and can perhaps
save you a bad experience.

Chances

Another point that policewomen make is  
that forethought is in itself a safety  
measure. "A woman who never thought about  
being mugged or raped would be in great  
trouble if it happened. If a woman just one  
time thinks, "What if a man attacked me?”  
she'd be much safer. Just so she has some-  
thing to fall back on.

"If you've thought about it before, your  
thought will flash into your mind. If you  
haven't thought about it before, nothing  
will come to mind and you'll do nothing or  
you'll panic."

Once a woman is unavoidably in a danger-  
ous situation, she can often escape if she  
stays calm. Attackers usually have the  
edge because they take their victims by  
surprise. But many criminals underestimate  
female resources and can be surprised in  
turn quite easily.

With an unarmed attacker, the best method  
is probably to fight back immediately, mak-  
ing as much noise as possible. Since most  
men don't expect women to struggle seriously  
and women in danger are usually quite  
strong, the chances of escaping are reason-  
ably good.

A woman confronted by an armed assailant is  
better off pretending to comply with him un-  
til a chance for escape opens up. The im-  
portant thing is to remain calm enough to  
seize whatever opportunities are offered.

"Lady Beware" describes these situations  
and many others, following the "what if" for-  
mat suggested by one victim.

Handbooks can be distasteful, because they can make it seem  
as if genuine safety is only for fanatics  
who are willing to devote their lives to it.  
"Lady Beware" recognizes that safety is a  
desirable condition of life, but not the  
whole point of it. Arnold presents a range  
of preventative measures so that a reader  
can choose the ones that suit her. For  
instance, he starts out a chapter on hitch-  
hiking by saying women should never do it,  
and then proceeds to discuss women thumbing  
it, on the assumption that many nevertheless  
will. This kind of realism makes the book  
palatable.

We can't avoid taking chances in our daily  
lives and probably don't want to. But we  
should have a pretty fair idea of what  
chances we do take and how to handle the  
consequences. A book like "Lady Beware"  
can help.

Battles Won

“I met but few of the stars while I was in  
Hollywood. In New York I had met Mr. Charles  
Chaplin and Miss Greta Garbo, the latter a  
being who is, physically, of the lily tribe,  
but with a human heart and mind.

But I did meet Miss Marilyn Monroe.

In private life she was not in the least  
what her calumniators would have wished her  
to be. She was very quiet, had great natur-  
al dignity (I cannot imagine anyone who  
knew her trying to take a liberty with her),  
and was extremely intelligent. She was also  
exceedingly sensitive.

What will-power she must have needed in or-  
der to remain the human being she was, after  
the cruelty with which, in the past, she was  
treated! That is over now, and she is ac-  
cepted as the fine artist that she was. But  
that cruelty was completely odious. It  
arose partly, I think, from the envy of peo-  
ple who are devoid of beauty, and partly  
from the heartless stupidity of those who  
have never known a great and terrifying pov-  
erty. There are people, also, who cannot  
believe that beauty and gaiety are a part of  
goodness...

Immediately on my arrival in Hollywood, a  
certain American magazine with a huge cir-  
culation asked me to write for them...But  
still more important to them was that Miss  

since it was obvious that we were born to  
hate each other, would do so at first sight,  
and that our subsequent insults to each  
other would cause a commotion when reported.  
They never made a greater mistake.

That afternoon she wore a green dress and,  
with her yellow hair, looked like a daffo-  
dil. We talked mainly, as far as I remem-  
ber, about Rudolph Steiner, whose works she  
had just been reading...

In repose her face was at moments strange-  
ly, prophetically tragic, like the face of  
a beautiful ghost - a little spring-ghost,  
an innocent fertility-daemon, the vegetation  
spirit that was Ophelia.”

PSYCHOLOGY and WOMEN

AT MARSHALL 'U' HIGH SCHOOL

Dr. Lois Erickson at the
University of Minnesota has
developed a curriculum to pro
mote psychological maturity
in women using a developmental
framework derived from the
theories of Jane Loevinger
and Lawrence Kohlberg.

Loevinger's theory postulates
that an individual's ego develops
from a young child's differentiation
between self and non-self
through various stages of emotional
and social development to a possible
"integrated" stage in which complexity
of thought, perception of choices,
respect for others' autonomy, and a
valuing of justice are predominate.
Kohlberg's position is that moral
development progresses along stages
of growth which increasingly integrate
the concept of justice—from a
"what's in it for me" instrumental
hedonism orientation toward a possible
stage of moral decision-making based
on principles of universal justice.
Thus, they both see human growth as
progressing along stages—which direc-
tion can provide a goal for education.

This goal, movement along the
developmental stages of growth has
become the major objective in Erickson's
curriculum for women.

Extensive research indicates that
American men are more likely to reach
higher stages of development than
American women. Most women remain
on stage 3, social conforming
orientation, while about four times
as many men move ahead toward the
more complex modes of thought. Of
importance, it has been found that
no difference in moral maturity exists
between the sexes until adolescence,
at which time girls plateau in
psychological growth while boys
continue the movement toward higher
stages.

Dr. Erickson said several studies
demonstrate that girls "sell out"
their competency motivation sometime
in high school and get anchored in
a lifestyle that reinforces the middle
stages of growth, the social compromising
stage. The theories acknowledge this
inconsistency will lead to an erosion of
women's maturity, and the research
bears this out.

"We've talked about it so long,
now we must do something about it!"
is Erickson's position.

The curriculum model developed by
Erickson used a "Learning Psychology
by doing psychology" format first set
forth by John Dewey. Field interviewing
of girls and women across the life span
provided a means of viewing the process
of female development through different
ages, stages, and tasks. In the seminar
sessions the high school women reflected
about and integrated their interview data
and also focused on current articles on
the women's movement and related literary
works. A continuous thru-way focus was
maintained between the interview experiences,
the works of literature, and the examination
of "the self." Multiple assessments were
run on the class and on the Loevinger
measures of ego maturity and on the Kohlberg
measure of moral maturity.

This curriculum is the first in a series
of classes being developed to examine
sex roles and personal growth. A two-person
relationship class and a parenting class
(both with males) are now being piloted
and researched.

"Talk of American Spacewomen

Makes Me Sick”

Well, what do you know?

The National Aeronautics and  
Space Administration (NASA)  
recently announced that women  
appear no less able than men,  
physiologically, to withstand  
the rigors of space flight.

This remarkable fact was an-  
nounced following five weeks  
of testing eight Air Force  
nurses at NASA's Ames Re-  
search Center.

According to an account from  
the “Los Angeles Times,” NASA  
spokesmen stressed that these  
results "should not be taken  
as a back door commitment to  
put women into orbit, however."

No, the facts were just spun  
around cathode ray tubes and  
the story broadcast over ra-  
dio and television and clack-  
ed over wire service tele-  
types. You see, these tests de-  
termining the fitness of women  
as astronauts have already  
been run—14 years ago.

Thirteen women, several with  
more credentials than John  
Glenn and Scott Carpenter,  
were tested and found to be  
superior candidates for the  
astronaut program. Twelve  
more were slated for testing.  
But all have turned to other  
jobs after waiting for the  
space program to make use of  
their training, talents, and  
energies.

This latest "women are mak-  
ing progress" smoke screen  
was beautiful. The lovely  
Air Force cuties lined up to  
be panned by the television  
cameras—slowly. Yep, they  
were treated just like the  
guys and even did without sex  
during the five-week testing.  
And they all were single.

Interestingly, the publicity  
came after a well-done cover  
article on the first women  
astronaut candidates publish-  
ed in "MS" magazine last  
September. It was even more  
interesting that no one men-  
tioned the original women  
astronaut candidates in the  
latest coverage of women's  
progress.

By Heidi Reidel!

But women's news is seldom  
covered in detail by mass  
media, so what is well done  
is worth repeating.

Joan McCullough wrote of  
"The 13 who were left behind"  
in September's "MS," recount-  
ing the testing of women be-  
gun in 1959.

We all know about one small  
step for man and recognize  
the names, John Glenn, Neil  
Armstrong, Scott Carpenter.  
But what about Jerrie Cobb?

In 1959 Cobb had logged  
10,000 hours in the air,  
more than any other candidate  
being tested at that time. Cobb  
was the woman whose test re-  
sults would determine wheth-  
er other women would be test-  
ed. Her test results were  
exceptional and twelve other  
women were tested—

They, too, were found to be  
exceptionally qualified can-  
didates. In some ways, they  
were superior to men, accord-  
ing to McCullough's article;  
they weighed less on the av-  
erage, a potential saving of  
$1,000 a pound for cargo and  
human weight, for they also  
consumed less food and oxygen  
and could use a smaller cap-  
sule. They were more radi-  
ation-resistant, less prone  
to heart attack, and more dur-  
able in the event of heat,  
pain, noise, and loneliness.

Despite the flying color  
test results, NASA abruptly  
halted testing in July of  
1971, after 13 of the slated  
25 had been tested.

NASA had given no warning,  
no explanation, and no comment.

The women took the matter up  
with a specially convened  
Congressional subcommittee.  
The hearing lasted two days,  
with one NASA spokesman say-  
ing, "Talk of American space-  
women makes me sick to my  
stomach," and others insisting  
the program would be impeded  
if they were forced to in-  
clude women.

And John Glenn, for whom  
qualification regulations had  
been waived, said magnanimous-  
ly, "If we found women who  
could prove that they had  
more capabilities than the  
men, we'd welcome them aboard  
with open arms."

Once again women had to be  
more equal to be equal and the  
subcommittee admonished the  
"good ladies" to be patient.

Fourteen years have stretched  
on. Hans Mark, presently  
directing NASA's Ames Research  
Center, says, "So far we see  
no reason to believe there  
are any inherent problems to  
women flying in space," it is  
a little hard to swallow. And  
the American taxpayer should  
find that kind of repetitive  
song and dance intolerable as  
well.

These recently tested Air  
Force nurse volunteers are be-  
ing used to set medical stan-  
dards for women who may be  
included on American Space  
shuttles in the 1980s.

NASA administrator, Chuck  
Berry, told a recent space  
medicine conference, "For a  
long-duration flight such as  
to Mars, the crews would be  
confined inside their space-  
craft for nearly a year.  
With so much time on their  
hands, they'd react like oth-  
er normal human beings; they  
would want sexual diversion.  
It is therefore unrealistic  
to plan future flights with-  
out coming to grips with the  
problem of women. Naturally,  
the women would be fully-op-  
erational crew members...not  
only there for sex."

Gotcha, Mr. Berry. Over and out.

We are writing in regard to  
International Women's Day.  

We are all staff members of  
WBFO, a public radio station  
licensed by the State Univer-  
sity of New York at Buffalo  
and a member of the National  
Public Radio network. Women  
make up approximately 40% of  
our staff and hold positions  
in all areas of responsibili-  
ty--program director, produ-  
cer, engineer, program guide  
coordinator, announcer, li-  
brarian, etc. We also pro-  
duce two programs on a weekly  
basis of specific interest to  
women--"woman power" and  
“Sappho." All this just to  
give you an idea of who we  
are. Now to the point.  

On March 8, we plan to de-  
vote the entire 20 hours of  
our broadcast day to celebra-  
te International Women's Day.  
Women will be covering all on  
-the-air duties as well as  

technical and engineering.  
We have included a tentative  
schedule for the day. Since  
March 8 is still five weeks  
away, the schedule will un-  
doubtedly go through some  
changes. We hope to include  
drop-in modulars throughout  
the day - five (or so) minute  
tapes by/for/about women's  
activities both in and out of  
Buffalo. If you can prepare  
a short tape on your activi-  
ties or on any group in your  
area, we would love to have  
it for airplay. Needless to  
say, we need them as soon as  
possible. Also, we are pro-  
gramming a one-hour women's  
bibliography and if you can  
send us information about  
your activities as a group-  
bios, history, activities,  
and issues of any publicatio-  
ns, we certainly will use  
them.  

We are really excited about  
how plans for the day are pro-  
gressing. We did the same  
thing last year but hope this  
year's day shows the improve-  
ment we've all made. We want  
the day to be a chorus of wo-  
men's voices from all over  
the country--hope we hear  
from you soon.
