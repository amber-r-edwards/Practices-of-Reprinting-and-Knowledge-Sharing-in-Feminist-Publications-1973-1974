Trick Knees And Other  
BY KATE LIGARE  

I am not an  

feel complete and  
For various reasons, however, I never had  

the opportunity to be really physical around  

men during the first twenty years of my life.  

I watched them win their letters - first  

with admiration, then disgust, then bemuse-  

ment. I worked at a camp where the boys  

took longer and more arduous canoe trips,  

but I was always content with our placid  

pace, pleased enough to be out in the wild  

on my own.  
My contact and awareness began innocently  

enough. My college roommates and I decided  

we wanted to run on the indoor track at the  

male-inhabited stadium before breakfast.  

Then we wanted to play squash in the after-  

noons. And then we entered a beginner's  

squash tournament and beat some fellow male  

classmates. Such athletic competition and  

sweaty glory against men is one thing in  
square white  

courts with controlled light  

and heat; perhaps to a tradi-  

tional physical education department -  

but inconsequential in a more fundamental  

sense.  
As I began to camp and backpack alongside  

men during my wilderness summers, a whole  

new dimension of my existence as a physical  

woman came into focus. In a life where phy-  

sical strength and stamina became as essen-  
tial to everyday survival as good judgment  
and a quick mind, most female sexual stereo-  
types came cascading down.  

Concern over appearance became absurd;  
striving for a clean body and a head of hair  
were challenging enough when lakes still  
supported ice floes. Clothing became asex-  
ual. Everyone packed identical weights.  
People cooked for their friends. Those who  
had talent provided fish for supper. Mas-  
culine/feminine roles seemed only another  
artificiality of civilization that I was glad  
to leave behind, totally and forever, I  
thought at the time.  

I felt free to be dirty, to sweat, to  
strain to my physical limits and then enjoy  
the day-end exhaustion. It felt good to be  
primitive. I never had the sensation of  
being particularly organic or close to Mother  
Earth, but in retrospect, I guess our life  
did exist in such dimensions.  
Even that life, however, was somewhat  
transitory and escapist. When I began this  
summer, however, to work as a professional  
instructor alongside men, my confidence fal-  
tered for the first time. No longer was I  
merely enjoying the wilderness, but along  
with three men I assumed responsibility  
for the safety and well-being of 26 students  
for five weeks of instruction and backpack-  
ing in the rugged Wind River mountains of  
Wyoming. We had all received similar train-  
ing as instructors, yet it was obvious from  
the start that I was unequal. I soon came  
to agree, but that acceptance of self was  
difficult to achieve, even among men who  
obviously could not be terribly chauvinistic.  
I could read a map, catch fish, and do  
nearly everything as well as the other three  
instructors--except be as strong. I chose  
to not chew tobacco, but then so did they.  

Becky and Trick Knees  

When a girl collapsed of heat exhaustion,  
Dave carried her pack on top of his, while  
I coaxed her along, walking slowly and sev-  
eral hours behind. When a boy got sick, I  
was the one to fix tea and honey and sit up  
half the night by the fire forcing energy  
into his system. When another student seem-  
ed to have appendicitis, it was men who con-  
trolled and executed the evacuation proce-  
dures, while women stayed behind and quite  
literally kept the home fires burning. These

Judy Hickey, manager, and  
Darby Orange, publicity direc-  
tor of the Women's Auto Rac-  
ing Club, presided over a  
meeting Jan. 5 in Cedar Rapids,  
Iowa. Plans were discussed  
for the '73 racing season.  

‘A weekly race for members is  
being considered, plus Special  
Women on Wheels shows. Three  
events have already been  
booked for '73.  

This being the third year  
for some of the members, it  
was discussed having two  
classes in '73. One division  
for non-experienced members,  
basically street stock class  
with safety features only per-  
mitted. The other division  
for experienced drivers will  
feature a modified class.  
Rules for the modified class  
will be furnished at a later  
date.  

Ms. Hickey, manager of WARC,  
is undecided as to what the '73  
season will bring for her.  

She received a request from  
race promoter Lee Wall of the  

Women’s  
Sports  

Convention  

Greenboro Motor Speedway Inc.,  
North Carolina, under NASCAR  
sanction. Wall stated that he  
and other promoters think  

that the time is at hand to  
establish a regular class for  
women in that area. According  
ly Greenboro Motor Speedway  
Inc. has sought and received  
approval to establish such a  
class.  

Ms. Hickey and Ms. Orange  
will be leaving for the south-  
ern states at the end of January  
to discuss future plans for  
the nation's club. And to at-  
tend a National Convention on  
Women in Sports conducted by  
NOW (National Organization  
for Women) which will be held  
in February in Atlanta, Ga.

Dear Sisters:  

If your state is to ratify  
the ERA, emergency action is  
needed--and fast. Over in  
St. Paul (how appropriate!)  
the Archdiocesan Council of  
Catholic Women has launched  
a statewide attack on the  
proposed amendment. Unless  
they feel feminist pressure,  
many legislators will show  
their respect for Catholi-  
cism's political clout (and  
their yen for R.C. votes) by  
voting "no" on the ERA.  
Please don't give the Cath-  
olic Church a chance to kill  
this amendment. Urge your  
readers to deluge their con-  
gressmen and legislators  
with pro-twenty-seventh a-  
mendment letters. Thank you  
very much. May "Gold Flow-  
er" blossom now and forever.  

Sincerely,  

Wiccan Rede  

Read “Sty of Papal Masculist Sows". Like prisoners  

kept in the dark for pro-  

longed periods, some Catho-  
lic women retreat from the  
blinding light entering  
their cell when the door fi-  
nally is opened. Temporar-  
ily unable to bear the re-  
sponsibility of freedom,  
they cannot bear the thought  
of any other woman's liberty.

PEOPLE'S COMPANY

A Rape Crisis Center has opened  
in Minneapolis to aid victims  
of the "nation's least reported  
violent crime against a person,"  
according to Rita Gallagher of  
the Center.  

Headquartered in the Women's  

Counseling Service, the Rape  
Crisis Center will operate 24  
hours a day from the phone num-  
ber 824-RAPE.  

STOP  
RAPE  

Another rape center was opened  
last month by a group of south  
Minneapolis churches. But "they  
will just offer counseling for  
a short time," says Kathy Mc-  
Connell of the Crisis Center.  
"We will offer both immediate  
counseling and carry through the  
entire medical and legal pro-  
cess."  

"When a rape victim calls in,"  
Ms. McConnell says, “a volunteer  

will talk to her, give immediate  
counseling and determine if she  
needs transportation to safety or  
to a hospital. Volunteers will  
also see that the medical exam is  
correct, both medically and leg-  
ally."  

In addition, volunteers will  
assist the victim in pressing  
charges against her assailant, as  
well as offering pertinent infor-  
mation and personal counseling.  
Self-defense classes and a speak-  
er's bureau will also be part of  
the Rape Crisis Center's program.  

“Women should be aware that no  
local hospital considers rape an  
emergency situation," Ms. Gallag-  
her explains. "And women don't  
realize that the hospital is part  
of the legal process. In Minnea-  
polis, they'll check for traces  
of sperm to prove rape. The wo-  
man's body is checked for bruises,  
scratches and signs of assault,  
which are sometimes photographed."  

The Rape Crisis Center will  
provide referrals to selected  
physicians. “Few physicians will  
take rape cases because of the  
possibility of court testimony,”  
Ms. Gallagher points out.  

Statistics indicate that the in-  
cidence of this crime is rising,  
Ms. Gallagher says. "A woman is  
raped every 14 minutes. There have  
been 340,270 reported rapes in the  
U.S. since 1970--and that doesn't  
include attempts. And it is es-  
timated that ten times as many  
rapes occur as are reported."  

As for the legal aspects of the  
crime, Ms. Gallagher indicates,  
"Women don't realize that they're  
just a piece of evidence in the  
case, a material witness for the  
prosecution." Rape Crisis Center  
volunteers will provide victims  
with necessary information about  
the legal process as well as ac-  
companying the women through the  
courts.  

“Women's traditional attitude is  
that when you're raped, there's  
nothing you can do," Ms. McCon-  
nell says. "We are trying to  
change that."  

Trick Knees, (Continued from page 1)  

were not always easy tasks for a supposed  
feminist.  

For my job status did depend on how well I  
executed my tasks, and there were several  
times that, with good judgment but a begrud-  
ging sense of resignation, I was forced to  
give over tasks and responsibilities to men.  
At the same time, there were really no tasks  
that I performed that one of the male in-  
structors could not have done as well. It  
was simply, and in the most primitive sense  
possible, division of labor according to  
ability, which, in extreme cases of emer-  
gency and exertion, was of necessity measur-  
ed in highly physical terms.  

Beating a man in a game of squash is satis-  
fying, mainly because you are still playing  
and struggling with society's rules and pre-  
conceptions. Arguing with a man at a party  
can be satisfying because you are standing  
on nearly equal ground. But finding your-  
self in a position where you must be treated  
differently because you no longer have the  
equalizing benefits of intelligence and so-  
ciety at your side is a difficult situation  
for contemporary men and women to handle  
without a certain degree of patronization.  
Even having a close relationship with a man  
in the city is far different than thirty  
miles back in the hills. There, you are  
both nearer to the fundamental differences  
between the sexes, yet, at the same time,  
you are freer and farther removed from so-  
ciety's crippling perversion of these physi-  
cally-based differences.  

When I returned to the city this fall, I  
talked to a very physically active friend of  
mine about these realizations of the summer. —  
She understood immediately and said how glad  
she has been, in a way, to have had a trick  
knee most of her life. How much that freed  
her from any ultimate physical activity, how  
much easier it was to rely on a trick knee  
instead of having to admit to no longer hav-  
ing the strength or stamina to continue. I  
envied her, yet it also made me mad.  

For it is yet another aspect of society  
that makes physical women ashamed when they  
can no longer compete with men because of  
basic biological differences. It is just as  
important for a girl at camp to discover she  
can portage a canoe over a mile of twisty  
trails as it is for her to realize that a  
man can do it faster - and that she should  
let him do it in certain situations with no  
remorse or loss of self-worth.  

Society has done much toward the libera-  
tion of females, but it has also insulated  
them against a more fundamental and total  
acceptance of their physical selves in rela-  
tion to men and the tasks and crises of the  
physical world. A lack of this knowledge  
and/or experience results not only in a cri-  
tical naivete about the world and society,  
but hampers a full healthy contact with our-  
selves and our bodies.  

We will not all turn to organic farming  
and living off the land in our lifetimes. We  

may never suffer the horrors of war or flood,  

or disaster. Few of us will ever experience  
the frustration of female athletes competing  
in a world of male-dominated Olympics and  
record books.  

But we must, nevertheless, slowly begin to  
accept our bodies and their physical limita-  
tions, with or without trick knees, as sepa-  
rate from our feminist liberation. As a re-  
sult, women will end up feeling as strong  

and independent as ever, but simultaneously  

feeling free of the need to make apologies  
in whatever encounters they may have with  
the physical lives and abilities of the men  
with whom they work and live.

ERA Passes House, Faces Senate--

Will Bill’s Fate Affect Future Women’s Lobbying?

by Mary Hastings

The Minnesota House of  
Representatives passed the  
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)  
by a vote of 106 to 24 Jan-  
uary 17.

The Amendment, which en-  
countered heated opposition,  
may face even stronger re-  
sistance in the State Sen-  
ate. Sen. Jack Davies (L,  
Dist. 60), has scheduled a  
hearing on the Amendment  
before the Senate Judiciary  
Committee January 23. Dav-  
ies has the option of set-  
ting as many hearings on the  
Measure as he deems necess-  
ary.

The ERA states: "Equality  
of rights under the law  
shall not be denied or abri-  
dged by the United States,  
or any State, on account of  
sex."

The measure must be rati-  
fied by 38 states; at pre-  
sent 22 states have ratified  
it.

ERA is vital to women's  
progress toward economic and  
social freedom. But the bill  
is only the first--and  
seemingly "non-controversi-  
al"--step in that direction.  
Nonetheless, ERA has elicit-  
ed emotional opposition from  

People’s Food System  
(Good Food Cheap)  

such groups as Happiness of  
Women (HOW), The American  
Legion, The John Birch Soc-  
iety, The Ramsey County Re-  
publican Women's Association  
and The Minnesota T-Party.

It is doubtful that the  
wildly irresponsible charges  
of anti-ERA forces will de-  
feat the bill in the State  
Senate. However, the oppo-  
sition may produce an un-  
desirable effect in our leg-  
islators and women fighting  
for ERA. If an ERA victory  
is hard-won, legislators may  
feel smug about their polit-  
ical "morality" in support-  
ing a "controversial" mea-  
sure. And women may exhaust  
themselves in the fight for  
ERA and retire from the field  
with little desire to reded-  

icate themselves to the nec-  
essary work that must be  

done to pass an abortion re-  
peal bill, comprehensive  
child-care legislation and  
welfare reform measures.

Local Women's Movement  
groups have dedicated them-  
selves to passage of the  
ERA. The Coalition to Rat-  
ify the ERA has placed eff-  
ective lobbyists at the State  
Legislature.

History of Gold Flower and Staff  

Gold Flower, a monthly Twin  
Cities women's publication, is  
named for a Chinese peasant wo-  
man whose life typifies the stru-  
ggles of many women. While in  
early life, she flaunted conven-  
tion by loving the man of her  
choice, Gold Flower later accept-  
ed an arranged marriage, in  
which she lived miserably. Fin-  
ally, banding together with other  
village women, she achieved a

Minnesota Women's Political  
Caucus (MWPC), predicts that  
ERA will pass the State Sen-  
ate but may face stronger  

opposition than in the House.  

Dieterich noted that the  
MWPC will also dedicate lob-  
bying efforts to the passage  
of an effective child care  
bill this Session. MWPC  
will work with The Child-  
ren's Lobby and the Coali-  
tion for Comprehensive Child  
Care in this effort.

The 1971 Legislature app-  
ropriated $250,000 for The  
Child Care Facilities Act.  
Dieterich explained that the  
appropriation should be in-  
creased, but the Governor  
hasn't asked for an increase  
in his budget message.

Dieterich said that  
$700,000 would be a "reason-  
able figure".

"I think the vi a alia  
request will pass," she  
added. But the possibility  
of an increased appropria-  
tion is uncertain.

She added that MWPC will  
cooperate in supporting an  
abortion bill later in the  
legislative session.

How To  

Beat  

The  
Boss:  

Get it in  
writing  

BY PAT MONAGHAN  

"There's almost nothing you  
can do by yourself to fight man-  
agement," Frances Boelter main-  
tains. "Women have to take a  
united stand."  

Ms. Boelter, a personnel ad-  
ministrator at the federal De-  
partment of Housing and Urban  
Development (HUD), is one of  
several women who will speak at  
the Women's Employment Workshop  
this month.  

"The most important thing is  
to organize, then to document  

your efforts," the employment  

specialist claims. "Management  
has almost no recourse when pre-  
sented with official documenta-  
tion. Words and promises don't  
mean anything—it has to be in  
writing."  

Four employment specialists  
will define women's working rights  
at a midday workshop Jan. 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center, 24  
West 31st Street.  

Sponsored by Model City Women's  
Task Force, the information ses-  
sion is "designed to get women  
to realize how to make the laws  
work for them," says Frankie  
Quade, Model City staffer. "It's  
a practical workshop on how to  
make ‘affirmative action' work.  

"A lot of women," Ms. Quade  
continues, "are not even aware of  
what the words ‘affirmative act-  
ion’ mean. When I first read the  
laws I was amazed at the rights  
women do have."  

Registration begins at 9:30  
a.m. for the session, with the  
program beginning at 10 a.m.  

A formal morning session and in-  
formal workshops in the after-  
noon are planned, with a bagged  
lunch break. Workshops are sche-  
duled to conclude at 2 p.m.  

The idea for a workshop grew,  
Ms. Quade explains, from an em-  
ployment seminar sponsored last  
fall by Federally Employed Women  
(FEW) of St. Paul.  

“Ours will follow that model,  
concentrating on federal reg-  
ulations and particularly the  
affirmative action rules. It's  
vital that women learn about  
these regulations. There are  
many local businesses, like  
Honeywell and Control Data, that  
are covered."  

specialist claims. "Management  
has almost no recourse when pre-  
sented with official documenta-  
tion. Words and promises don't  
mean anything—it has to be in  
writing."  

Two years ago Ms. Boelter was  
a clerical worker; she now holds  
a professional management post.  
She specializes in "career devel-  
opment," a provision of federal  
affirmative action regulations  
which requires training and  
promotion for women and minority  
people.  

"The affirmative action reg-  
ulations are helpful to women in  
the clerical field as far as of-  
fering them training," Ms. Boel-  
ter explains, "and they help the  
professional woman by opening up  

jobs in her field."  

The affirmative action regula-  
tions, with other employment laws  
of importance to women, are the  
focus of the workshop, slated  
for Jan. 27 at Sabathani Com-  
munity Center. There is no  
charge for the program, which  
will feature workshops on spe-  
cific employment problems.  

Ms. Boelter describes problems  
common to working women, particu-  
larly those in the clerical field  
from which she started. "Often  
a woman hired as a secretary or  
typist will do research, compile  
reports, and do other profession-  
al or paraprofessional duties—  
then when she looks for another  
job, she's just a secretary."  

For this reason Ms. Boelter  
stresses the importance of  
“position descriptions—usually  
a management tool, but extremely  
beneficial to employees." Such  
descriptions define the actual  
duties of each employee and  
are prepared cooperatively by  
employee and manager.  

Secretaries should be trained  
for professional or para-  
professional jobs, Ms. Boelter  
insists, so that there will  
be more mobility from clerical  
to higher ranks. "This is an  
important issue for women, be-  
cause 95 percent of the clerical  
force is women and minorities,"  
she comments.  

"Job restructuring—taking a  
professional position, breaking  
out some jobs that don't need  
professional education, and  
giving those tasks to para-  
professionals." Not only would this  
enable an agency or industry to  
hire fewer professionals, thus  
lowering costs, but "it would  
give clerical workers somewhere  
to go."  

Ms. Boelter suggests that col-  
lege-educated women entering  
professional fields have greater  
potential for upward mobility  
than do most secretaries. "But  
we also see a lot of college-  
educated secretaries," she says,  
remarking that her agency and  
others have adopted policies  
which disallow this "underhiring  
of women."  

"Career development is as  
important to the employer as to  
the employee," Ms. Boelter con-  
cludes. "It's not a matter of  
promising everyone a professional  
job, but of letting everyone work  

to their top capability, to get  

the best possible job from each  
person.”

THE DESTINY OF  
WOMEN By Addie Mattson  

"I can applaud the present  
attitude of experimentation"  
in sexual roles. This was  
the closing comment of Dr.  
Eleanor Maccoby in her ad-  
dress to the 1973 Nobel Con-  
ference at Gustavus Adol-  
phus College recently. Dr.  
Maccoby is a research psy-  
chologist in the field of  
social and intellectual de-  
velopment of children at  
Stanford University.  

Dr. Maccoby dealt succes-  
sively with the entire  
sphere of criteria the sci-  
entific world has used to  
test sexual differences in  
the psychological area.  

She treated first upon the  
"feminine passive" theory.  
Many people, scientists and  
laymen alike, attach great  
significance to the female  
supine position of the sex-  
ual act--the male intrusive  
and aggressive, the woman re-  
ceptive and passive. Dr.  
Maccoby raised the point at  
this juncture as to whether  
the female's withdrawal was  
not really a form of aggres-  
sion--if indeed, the female  
did not actually originate  
the sexual approach by her  
seeming reluctance which in  
turn stimulates the male to  
pursuit.  

Dr. Maccoby cited reactions  
of young children of both  
sexes under various (to a  
child) threatening circum-  
stances. Children of both  
sexes respond in certain  
ways to the appearance of a  
stranger, removal of a toy,  
a loud noise, but these re-  
actions are not governed  
along consistent sexual  
lines. That is, the number  
of boy toddlers who hollered  
"mama" in one group was  
sometimes greater than the  
number of girls who cried,  
sometimes less.

Dr. Eleanor Maccoby  

When dealing with the ques-  
tion of an existing correla-  
tion between intellect and  
sex, Maccoby gave a simple  
yet thought-provoking illus-  
tration. She first related  
the case of a number of  
young teenage girls whose  
mothers had been given large  
amounts of male hormones  
during the course of their  
pregnancies. The girls were  
very active and competitive  
and had "noticeably" high  
I.Q.'s. (These attributes  
are generally considered  

to be masculine characteris-  
tics, of course).  

After the hum from the audi-  
ence died down, Maccoby  
grinned and then cited an-  
other group of girls whose  
mothers had been given fe-  
male hormones in large  
amounts while pregnant, and  
whose daughters were also  
highly competitive and in-  
telligent. The inference  
drawn from this, she said,  
was not that either male or  
female hormones had caused  
these qualities, but that  
the excessive amounts of  
hormones had made the differ-  
ences.  

Her point was well made:  
that even to the trained  
scientific mind, sometimes  
sexual differences and dis-  
tinctions lie in the eyes  
of the beholder; that even  
scientists sometimes see  
what they want to see.  

As Dr. Maccoby progressed  
more deeply into her lecture,  
a certain pattern began to  
emerge: that, in the early  
years (a few months to about  
three years of age) child  
development there are pre-  
cious few and inconsistent  
areas of differentiation be-  
tween the sexes.

How to meet people,  

verbal, mathematical and  
spatial visualization.  

On the first, verbal skills,  
she said that the feminine  
achievement in this area had  
been exaggerated. That al-  
though females talk earlier,  
the differences are still  
minimal in young children.  
The later "talkativeness" of  
women, she said, was due to  
conditioning which came into  
play as the parents began to  
reinforce stereotypes, i.e.,  
the strong silent male, the  
bubbly little "daddy's girl".  

Mathematical skills develop  
at an approximately even  
rate as well, again until  
role reinforcement comes  
into play.  

In spatial visualization,  
the development in the early  
years proceeds at an equal  
rate in children of both  
sexes. However,  

and this, I felt  

was Maccoby's most telling  
point, and the crux of her  
lecture, in mathematical  
skills and in spatial vis-  
ualization, by age seven or  
eight, boys are ahead of  
girls in these areas and as  
the children grow towards  
puberty, and beyond, the  
distinction grows more mark-  
ed and in time becomes a  
permanent differentiating  
factor.  

Dr. Maccoby found a vital  
link between the different  
achievement rates in math  
and spatial visualization  
skills at the early-teen  
stage. Girls, she said,  

at this age are very aware  
already of the "feminine  
mystique". They have learned  
to be "smart enough to play  
dumb". Already they have  
forfeited their psycholo-  
gical equality to social-  
sexual expediency.

Feminist Historian “Stumbles  
Over Women” in History  

by MARY HASTINGS  

Scott read diaries of Southern women and  
discovered truths lying behind many Ante-  
Bellum Southern myths about women and  
slavery. She noted that Southern women bore  
no resemblance to the Scarlett O'Hara proto-  
type. Rather, they were shrewd plantation  
supervisors who shouldered the responsibili-  
ty for such “indelicate” tasks as yearly  
hog-killing.  

Feminist pressures are changing people's  
behavior, but a Southern feminist histori-  
an doubts that "people's assumptions (about  
women) have changed."  

Talking on "Feminism and History," Anne  
Firor Scott inaugurated a series of five  
evening lectures at 8 p.m. January 15 in  
Murphy Hall Auditorium on the University of  
Minnesota campus.  

Scott embarked on her feminist study  
some 20 years before women's studies were  
fashionable. She was a new kind of scholar  
who brought new insights into the record.  

The evening series is part of an Ameri-  
can Studies course called "The Effects of  
Feminism on American Intellectual Life."  

"My emotional involvement in this work  
kept me going," she explained. She learned  
that "just because something isn't in the  
books doesn't mean it didn't happen."  
"I am now learning to study the lives of  
obscure people," she said. “Women in Amer-  
ica have lived, to a great degree, in pri-  
vate, so there are many private records  
people must use to find out about women."  

Prof. Elsa Green, coordinator of the  
course, introduced Scott to approximately  
275 persons. Scott is Senior Fellow at the  
Johns Hopkins Institute of Southern History  
and a specialist in the history of southern  
women.  

In assessing the effect of feminism on  
history, Scott noted that although "femin-  
ist tactics" have affected the atmosphere  
in American intellectual institutions, the  
proportion of women in them hasn't changed  
"since the agitation began."  

In the early 1960s, Scott continued,  
"feminism--long latent--again burst on the  
scene."  

She added that we are only half-way  
through the task of redefining the social  
history of America.  

Today a "considerable number" of young  
women have elected to become historians to  
find out more about themselves and "these  
women have begun to redefine the whole fo-  
cus of historical inquiry."  

"What we don't study reveals as much  
about a culture as what we do," Scott de-  
clared. And American historians--largely  
upper-middle class, white Protestant males--  
haven't studied women until the last few  
years.  

She added that the most striking aspect  
of this new group of women scholars is  
their "extraordinary cooperation with one  
another--this cooperation makes knowledge  
grow faster."  

Scott, a native Georgian, attended Har-  
vard University in the early 1940s and en-  
countered a "pervasive anti-Southernism."  
In reaction to this bias, she determined to  
write her thesis on Southern Progressives.  
And as she perused the records of the South  
since 1890, she "kept stumbling over women"--  
women who were effective leaders and organ-  
izers of such causes as child labor laws.  

Following Scott's lecture the audience  
engaged her in a half-hour question and  
answer period.  

Prof. Mary Turpie, head of the American  
Studies Program, was also at the podium.  

"I was puzzled at first because I hadn't  
encountered women much in my graduate stud-  
ies. Male historians simply hadn't noticed  
women."  

The next evening be January  
31 at 8 p.m. in Murphy Hall Auditorium.  
Carroll Smith Rosenberg, assistant profess-  
or of history and psychiatry at the Univ-  
ersity of Pennsylvania, will discuss the  
history of psychiatric thought.  

Her curiosity aroused, Scott set about  
discovering why Southern women had been so  
intent on remaining "invisible and ladylike"  
while being "quite revolutionary."  

The evening lectures are free and open  
to the public.

How to Have  
Intercourse  

Without Getting  
Screwed  

Contraception  

A variety of techniques is  
employed to prevent pregnan-  
cy when sexual contact oc-  
curs. These all share the  
label "contraceptive," but  
they differ widely in the  
way they work and in their  
convenience, cost, and ef-  
fectiveness. Table 1 shows  
the degrees of effectiveness  
of the contraceptive methods  
discussed in this manual.  

In this section several  
methods are discussed along  
with their advantages and  
disadvantages. Furthermore,  
some "nonmethods," or tech-  
niques that are employed for  
the purpose of contraception  
but are ineffective, are de-  
scribed.  

The Dilemma of Preplanning  

Frequently high-school-age  
and college-age women are  
just beginning to be sexual-  
ly active. Moreover, they  
are at a time in their lives  
when they often have not ar-  
rived at a stable relation-  
ship and, therefore, may not  
have a single, permanent  
sexual partner. These two  
conditions combine to create  
a situation wherein many wo-  
men do not know whether they  
will be engaging in sexual  
intercourse the following  
month, week, or day. Some-  
times women conclude from  
this uncertainty that they  
should not prepare them-  
selves for, or protect them-  
selves from the results of,  
sexual intercourse, because  
it would somehow indicate  
that they are promiscuous.  
Tied in with this concept is  
the notion that "nice girls"  

don't voluntarily submit to  
sexual relations, that they  
are pressured into them. In  
response to this, one can  
only say that in our society  
the burden of contraception  
typically falls on the fe-  
male and that women who do  
not assume this burden are  
usually women who get preg-  
nant. It is, of course,  
true that a few women may  
engage in intercourse the  
first time without having  
any idea beforehand that in-  
tercourse would take place,  
but after the first sexual  
act if not before, a woman  
should inform and prepare  
herself for future contra-  
ception. Preplanning may be  
temporarily damaging to  
one's self-image, but preg-  
nancies out of wedlock,  
which accounted for one-  
eighth of the children born  
in Seattle in 1968, are of-  
ten damaging to lives in  
more permanent and costly  
ways.  

This is not to imply that  
the burden of contraception  
should always fall on the  
female. Morally, men have  
an obligation to protect  
themselves and their partner  
and they should share the  
effort involved in success-  
ful contraceptive planning.  
(But don't count on it!)  

Birth Control Pills  

"The pill," which is al-  
most 100 percent effective  
when taken as instructed,  
produces a state of pseudo  
(or false) pregnancy in the  
body and thus prevents ovu-  
lation. There are two types  

of oral contraceptives, and  
with each the woman takes  

pills for twenty or twenty-  

and Nonmethods  
of Contraception  

one days of her menstrual  
cycle, starting on the fifth  
day after menses. One type  
is the combination, contain-  
ing both estrogen and pro-  
gestin. The other type is  
the sequential pill. Its  
name derives from the fact  
that for the first fifteen  
days following menses the  
woman takes a pill contain-  
ing just estrogen, followed  
by five pills containing  
both estrogen and progestin.  
The sequentials have been  
shown to be less effective  
and somewhat more hazardous  
than the combination pill.  
The pill frequently has  
side effects that may be  
negative, positive, or neu-  
tral. For the most part,  
these same side effects are  
associated with pregnancy.  
It may clear up the complex-  
ion, may prompt a small gain  
in weight, and may enlarge  
the breasts slightly. Its  
use also may be associated  
with increased or diminished  
sexual desire. Some clear  
advantages of the pill:  
1. It is easy to use and is  
believed to be the most ef-  
fective method, PROVIDED IT  
IS TAKEN DAILY!  
2. It is one of very few  
contraceptives that is inde-  
pendent of the sex act:  
nothing need be done immedi-  
ately before, during, or af-  
ter intercourse.  
3. It is not subject to  
those errors of use that of-  
ten affect the reliability  
of the mechanical methods  
after sexual interest has  
been aroused.

some brands include seven

hormonal ingredients.

periods, lightens the flow,  
and may eliminate cramps.  

Two types of disadvantages  
are associated with the  
pill:  

The first is a group of  
minor side effects that re-  
semble symptoms of early  
pregnancy and commonly dis-  
appear after the first few  
months of taking the pill.  
They may include nausea,  
breast tenderness, depres-  
sion, nervousness, backache,  
or increased vaginal dis-  
charge, which may be linked  
to increased rates of yeast  
infection associated with  
usage of the pill. However,  
these are not experienced by  
all women who take the pill.  

The second type of disad-  
vantage associated with the  
pill has to do with its  
safety, which recently has  
been the subject of much in-  
vestigation. The official  
government verdict as to the  
safety of using oral contra-  
ceptives is that while risks  
exist, "When these potential  
hazards and the value of the  
drugs are balanced, the com-  
mittee finds the ratio of  
benefit to risk sufficiently  
high to justify the designa-  
tion safe within the intent  
of the legislation."**  

The major hazard is an in-  
creased tendency of a few  
pill-taking women toward  
blood-clotting diseases,  
such as thrombophlebitis.  
This ailment can sometimes  
result in a pulmonary embol-  
ism, or blood clot in the  
lung, which is often disabl-  
ing and can be fatal. The  
frequency of such a fatal  
side effect is low: about  
1.5 deaths per 100,000 pill-  
taking women under 35 years  
of age, and 4 deaths per  
100,000 for women over 35.  
These rates may be compared  
with the death rate of preg-  
nant women who die from com-  
plications during their  
pregnancy: 20 to 25 per  
100,000 women. Moreover, it  
is estimated that for every  
100,000 illegal abortions,  
about 100 women die.  

There are unanswered ques-  
tions about a possible con-  
nection between taking the  
pill and acquiring cancer,  

especially of the cervix or  
the breast; about metabolic  
effects, such as diabetes  
and liver dysfunction; about  
genetic effects, such as  
polyploidy, in which the  
fetus has too many sets of  
chromosomes and always  
aborts; and about amenorrhea  
and anovulation, the failure  
to menstruate or ovulate  
after going off the pill.  
Clinicians have suggested  
that women can minimize the  
dangers associated with the  
pill by using a pill with the  
lowest possible amount of  
estrogen, by selecting com-

Pills vary widely in the amounts of estrogen and pro-  

gestins they contain.  

While there are some differences  

in the various compounds and their biologic activity,  
many authorities feel that those differences are not im-  

portant and that,  

in general, the less medication, the  
better, particularly in the amount of estrogens.  

Listed  

above are the pills now approved by the FDA, divided into  

two groups, the combinations and the sequentials.  

The  

preparations are listed in order of increasing estrogen  
component per tablet, then in order of increasing  
progestin component per tablet, and then, when estrogen  
and progestin components are the same, in order of  
increasing number of tablets per month.*

lic agencies.  

Injectable Contraceptives  

Injectable contraceptives  
(dipo-provera) are a new and  
still experimental type of  
contraceptive. They have...  

been used on a limited basis  
for several years and are  
just now becoming available  
to members of the medical  
profession, who may pre-  
scribe them for contracep-  
tive purposes. Their poten-  
tial drawbacks limit their  
distribution to women who  
are quite certain that they  
have finished their child-  
bearing or that they want no  
children. These contracep-  
tives should be available  
for general use in a few  
years.  

Injectable contraceptives  
are ovulatory depressants  
that consist of progesterone  
acetate, which is injected  
into the patient once every  
three months. Their advan-  
tages include the facts that

one injection lasts for a
three-month period, that
they have been demonstrated
to be at least as effective
as the pill because there is
almost no opportunity for
patient error, and that they
have minimal side effects.
Because the injected medica-
tion doesn't include estro-
gen, the dangers associated
with estrogen in birth-con-
trol pills aren't present.
One side effect is an almost

complete absence of menstru-
ation during the time the
woman is using the contra-
ceptive. A potential disad-
vantage is that menstruation
and ovulation may not begin
again for as long as a year
after cessation of injec-
tions. It is for this rea-
son that the use of injecta-
ble contraceptives is not
recommended for women who
are planning to have child-
ren.

This contraceptive method
is still being tested, and
women who select it as their
method of birth control
should recognize that re-
search on long-term effects
hasn't been completed. How-
ever, the method is availa-
ble through some agencies
and private physicians,
especially if the woman is
older and has no plans for
childbearing.

Intrauterine Device (IUD)

The intrauterine device is
a loop, ring, coil, or
shield made of malleable
plastic and inserted into
the uterine cavity. It is
inserted during menstrua-
tion, preferably on the
first day of the period, and
begins to function immedi-
ately to prevent conception.
While the IUD follows steri-
lization, injectable contra-
ceptives, and the pill in
effectiveness, a few women
out of every hundred women
using it for one year do be-
come pregnant. These un-
planned pregnancies can re-
sult, after expulsion of the
IUD from the uterus without
the woman's knowledge or can
occur with the IUD in place.
Expulsion is most likely to
occur within the first three
months after the device has
been installed. It is par-
ticularly during this period
that users should check to
see that it is in place be-
fore depending on it for
protection. This is done by
reaching into the vagina and
feeling for a small nylon
string that is attached to
the IUD. Unplanned pregnan-
cies with the IUD still in
place are most likely during
the first eighteen months.

Part IE
Contraception and
Nonmethods of Contraception

For the woman to be fully
protected, an additional
form of protection against
pregnancy, such as foam or
condom, should be used dur-
ing the middle part of the
menstrual cycle.

Exactly how the IUD works
is not known. Physicians
believe that it either sets
up muscular movements that
force the egg into the uter-
us before it is ready to be
implanted there, or it some-
how prevents the walls of
the uterus from accepting
the fertilized egg.

The advantages of the IUD
are limited to the 50 percent
to 75 percent of the female
population whose bodies tol-
erate it. Two advantages
are that, once in place, it
furnishes contraception in-
definitely and that the only
cost is the initial one.*
Moreover, like the pill, it
is a birth-control technique
that is independent of the
sexual act, except that for
the first several months af-
ter insertion users should
make sure it is in place be-
fore intercourse. Addition-
ally, when a woman wishes
to become pregnant, the IUD
is readily removable by a
physician.

A major disadvantage is
that about 25 percent of the
women who have been fitted
with IUDs experience pain or

*Use of extra midcycle pro-
tection in the form of foam
or condoms naturally adds to
the total cost of this meth-
od of contraception.

excessive menstrual bleeding
sufficient to require their
removal. Over a five-year
period, the proportion who
can continue to use the IUD
drops to about 50 percent.

A few women expel it, some
discovering that they have
done so only when they be-
come pregnant. Younger wo-
men and women who never have
had a pregnancy are those
most likely to experience
difficulties with the IUD.
However, a new device, the
Dalkon shield, has been
successfully tolerated by
women who have never been
pregnant. The shield is
less likely to be rejected,
and its use creates less
cramping and bleeding.
Another difficulty experienc-
ed by a few women is infec-
tion of the pelvic organs
because while qualified
physicians use sterilized in-
struments to insert the
IUD, bacteria from the vagi-
na can enter the uterus
during insertion. It is im-
portant that a woman with a
vaginal infection not be fit-
ted with an IUD until the
condition is under control;
otherwise, the risk of pel-
vic infection would be in-
creased. A final, but very
slight, risk is uterine
perforation, experienced by
fewer than forty women out
of every hundred thousand.
Uterine perforation, in
which the IUD punctures the
uterus and moves into the
abdominal cavity, can be
corrected surgically.

Diaphragm

The diaphragm is a rubber, dome-shaped device that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to cover the cervix to prevent sperm's entering it. To be effective, it must be used with a spermicidal cream or jelly, which is placed on both the inside and the outside and around the edge of the diaphragm. The diaphragm must be specially fitted for each woman by a physician. Refitting is sometimes necessary. For effective contraception, refitting is recommended if the original fitting was before or shortly after the loss of virginity, after a miscarriage or childbirth, after an operation, or after a weight gain or loss of at least ten pounds. A diaphragm will last for several years before it must be replaced.

The diaphragm can be inserted up to three to six hours before intercourse and shouldn't be removed until at least six hours after ejaculation. It may be left in place as long as twenty-four hours.

The diaphragm is less effective than the pill or the IUD. Out of every hundred women who use diaphragms for a full year, about twelve are likely to become pregnant. This failure rate, however, is largely due to improper use, and it is reduced to about three per year per hundred women if the diaphragm is carefully used with ample cream or jelly.

The main advantage of the diaphragm is that its use is completely safe. No side effects or long-range health hazards are associated with its use. A further advantage for those who have intercourse only occasionally is that it is used only at the time of intercourse and does not require taking medication for weeks or months when no intercourse is taking place.

The primary disadvantage of the diaphragm is that it must be inserted just before intercourse. Some feel that this action reduces spontaneity of the sex act. Also, it can become dislodged during intercourse. Masters and Johnson found that displacement occurs most often when a coital position other than the face-to-face, male-above position is used.

Condom

The condom, also called the rubber, the prophylactic, or the safety, is a thin rubber or animal-tissue sheath that is worn on the penis during intercourse. When used properly, it is about as effective as the diaphragm. The condom is unrolled onto the erect penis so that there is enough space at the tip for the ejaculate. Reservoir tip condoms are recommended. The penis must be withdrawn from the vagina immediately after the male ejaculates, while it is still erect.

The condom should be carefully removed, and the hands and the penis should be washed, particularly if the couple is going to continue to be in close physical contact.

A major advantage of the condom is that it is the only really effective means of contraception that can be purchased without a prescription. Another advantage is that, if used conscientiously and throughout the entire period of sexual contact, it may provide protection against venereal disease. Condoms are especially suited to those couples who have intercourse only occasionally and do not wish to go to the trouble and the expense of using the pill during periods in which there is no intercourse. Some problems with using the condom can be alleviated by careful selection. Condoms made of animal skin, while slightly more expensive, will minimize loss of sensation to the male. "Wet," or lubricated, condoms that will aid vaginal entry are also available.

A spermicidal cream or jelly can be used both to improve effectiveness and to aid in entry. One of these is applied to the condom after it is put on the penis. It should never be applied to the penis itself, because this could cause the condom to slip off during intercourse. Vaseline and other petroleum jelly should be avoided, because they can cause the rubber to deteriorate and tear.

Although condoms are 98 percent effective when used properly (put on before any penile penetration), even greater protection can be obtained by using the condom in combination with a spermicide, such as foam. This increases the protection to the same level as provided by the pill (100 percent).

Condoms are available at most pharmacies. The price varies by brand and by particular features, e.g., lubrication, and ranges from 30 cents to 75 cents each (10 cents each at Planned Parenthood).

Vaginal Spermicides

All spermicidal contraceptives consist of two components, a spermicide and a nonreactive base. The latter provides most of the substance and functions as a diaphragm to block mechanically. (See Figure 3.) Spermicidal contraceptives include aerosol foams, gels, creams, and suppositories. Each must be used immediately prior to intercourse, the time varying from type to type but ranging from fifteen minutes to one hour preceding intercourse.

Of all the types, the aerosol foam is probably the easiest to use and the least messy. It is also more likely to provide sufficient substance to cover the cervix and thus to prevent conception. Spermicidal suppositories are somewhat less effective. They should not be confused with "feminine hygiene" suppositories, which do not prevent conception.

The major disadvantage of using such contraceptives is that foreplay must be interrupted to apply them. Also, women may not urinate or walk around after they have been applied. Women who prefer to douche after intercourse must wait at least six hours. Spermicides must be reapplied if intercourse is to be repeated.

Vaginal spermicides are somewhat less effective than the diaphragm. Their effectiveness can be improved to 100 percent by using them in combination with the condom.

Spermicides can be purchased without prescription at most pharmacies. Aerosol foams are slightly more expensive than tablets or gels. Monthly contraceptive cost for this method would run between $1 and $2.

IPEACE GROUPS CAMPAIGN  
TO REPEAL DRAFT LAWS  

Three organizations in the nine states of Mid-America are coordinating their efforts to repeal the draft in 1973. If no action is taken by Congress to extend it, the President's power to induct men into the armed services will end June 30, 1973. THIS DOES NOT END THE DRAFT. Peacetime conscription will continue in the form of required registration by all 18-year-old men; prosecution of those who fail to register, classification of all young men according to induction priority assigned to them, and the prosecution of those who refuse to deal with the bureaucracy.  

If the induction power of the President expires, leaving a condition popularly called “zero draft calls," the manpower mustering authority and the selective service machinery (which classifies and holds ready the manpower needed for war or for counter-insurgency actions)...will be in abeyance...READY TO BE ACTIVATED FOR THE NEXT "VIETNAM"...for the continuing of militarism in peacetime.

Flo Kennedy  
Headlines University Conference  

This month Feminists of both sexes will have an unprecedented opportunity to get together with those of the same persuasion. University of Minnesota Women's Liberation will, on Feb. 2 and 3, sponsor a conference on The New Feminism: Cultural, Educational, Church Women and Political Implications. Feminist actions on a local, national, and international scale will be discussed. Guest speakers of national renown have been obtained. Present will be Flo Kennedy, black activist, civil rights lawyer, co-founder of NOW and the Feminist Party, and author of Abortion Rap, and Barbara Roberts, M.D., coordinator of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition and part-time abortionist in her home state of Maryland. Also present will be an abortion rights activist from Canada, and a local black woman who will discuss forced sterilization.  

There will be a women's art display, and women poets and singers will present their work. There will be a multi-media show and a well-known feminist film will be aired.  

The function will be held in Coffman Memorial Union at the University of Minnesota. Admission will be inexpensive. For more information, give us a ring at 373-0033.  

The opportunity to not only pull the Feminist community together, but to be entertained and inspired is without parallel. All are welcome, all are urged to come and support it.  

AMERICA CANNOT DEMILITARIZE WITHOUT REPEALING THE DRAFT. Not only must the induction power of the President expire, but the law which creates the selective service bureaucracy, and provides the pool of men which history shows CAUSES NATIONS TO GO ON MILITARY ADVENTURES ABROAD: this law MUST BE REPEALED.  

The American Civil Liberties Union, founded after WWI to save civil liberties from the militarization caused by the war, and The American Friends Service Committee, founded during WWI to educate for peace and relieve the suffering from war, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, founded before WWI to educate people in the relation of peace and freedom...

FEET

by Jan Jirak

A woman's rising conscious-
ness in the liberation move-
ment can be compared to the
instance of someone standing
on your foot. At first you
say, "Excuse me, but you're
standing on my foot." In
rare instances, the offender
will say, "Oh, I'm sorry--"
and get off. More often,
through blindness, he will
say, "No, I'm not--you must
be imagining things." Recog-
nizing his myopia, and trying
to be sympathetic, you say,
"Pardon me, sir, but you are
standing on my foot, and it
does hurt." This exchange
will probably repeat itself
several times with increas-
ing emotion on both sides
until finally the offender
backs off.

Too often the stander's
nose is too high in the air
to let him notice the stand-
ee. This calls for action.
Sometimes you must push him
off. He gets hostile and
complains about how "women's
libbers" make everything in-
to a power struggle. Usual-
ly the support of other wo-
men is needed to get him
off.

Since women have been step-
ped on for so long, many
of them, not knowing any
other state of affairs, ac-
tually think they like it.
They even “invite" such ac-
tions by exposing their feet
and embellishing them until
they look good enough to
walk on. Of course, most
men take the mere presence
of female feet as an invita-
tion.

Women, too, are accomp-
lices in the assault. They
encourage it by treating
themselves and other women
as though they were capable
only of being stepped on.
"Anatomy is destiny"--you
were made with feet, so they
were made to be stepped on.
(Men have feet, too--I won-
der why their anatomy gives
them a different destiny.)

As a result of a long his-
tory of being stepped on,
many women are "flat-footed"
--and as much as they'd like
to walk on their own two
feet, they limp. Even if
their powers haven't been
damaged, everyone thinks
they have; so they have to
walk twice as fast as a man
to keep up with him. Em-
ployers don't trust her to
keep walking; they think
she'll just get married and
go back to being stepped on
again.

And so, until we all get
back on our feet again, I
recommend supportive shoes
to help us walk (women's
organizations) and a little
foot powder (women's publi-
cations) to make the walk
easier.

: Praxis School

Beginning January 17, the
"Socialist Feminism"
The Praxis School will enter
its second quarter. The
class has three parts; "His-
Story", which was covered in
the fall; "Theory" which will
be covered this quarter; and
"Strategy", which will be
tackled in the spring. Each
quarter, and indeed each
class meeting, however, is
open to all.

: Freedom and Justice

We felt that when we were
on more solid ground-in the
history and theory of femin-
ism, we could develop a use-
ful strategy to liberate
both women and the oppress-
ed.

For the title "Socialist Fem-
inism" is in earnest: we re-
ject the notion of women
simply receiving a bigger
piece of the American pie;
we want a just society.

Fusion in the Maze
The attempt to fuse femin-
ism and socialism is not as
yet finished, and in most
ways has, as yet, been far
from successful. But the
need remains: our daily ex-
perience can rarely tell us
whether we should be a lib-
eral feminist, or a social-
ist feminist. 

Understanding the varying view of real-
ity each kind of feminism
assumes, and looking at our
own experience in light of
such a view, can help us
find our way through the
maze. It is for this
reason that the theory course
offered this quarter seems
so crucial. Many of us have
read various feminist works
(Beauvoir, Firestone, Greer,
etc.) as they stimulated us
to change our lives, to be-
come feminists at all. Most
of us also have predilections
to various positions on
the political spectrum, us-
ually from extreme left to
liberal. But few of us have
read these same feminist
works critically and compar-
atively, with an eye to
their broader political per-
spective. It is this task
we plan to begin this quart-
er. As a special treat, we
will also be reading the new
theoretical works put
forward by various women's
groups: The Chicago Women's
Union political statement;
The NAM (New American Move-
ment) sexual politics paper;
papers read at the Socialist
Feminist Conference held
over Thanksgiving in Durham,
N.C.

The Praxis School is spon-
sored by the Mpls. chapter
of the New American Movement,
a new national organization
struggling for democratic
socialism in the U.S. Other
NAM projects include The
North Country Peace Campaign,
a political education and
action project, and The Met-
ropolitan Taskforce, a group
researching and struggling
to change the local balance
of power. The “Socialist
Feminist" class meets Wed-
nesdays from 7:30 to 9:30,
for six weeks. Tuition is
by donation.

The Politics of Abortion

By Mary Retsinas

I am respectfully compelled
to answer Jan Jirak’s arti-
cle. To begin with, we do
not hate men. That is a slan-
der that has been used against
the women's movement since
the year one. It has been
used to scare women away from
the women's movement and away
from fulfilling themselves,
because by so doing they are,
by definition, a threat to
men. We do not hate men. We
love our sisters, and hate the
oppression of women. If
hatred happens to be a part of
our collective personality,
we must not forget that hatred
is one facet of a healthy per-
sonality. It is when hatred
is inappropriate to the situa-
tion that it becomes unhealthy.
It is a common phenomenon
among oppressed peoples to
find members turning on one
another in response to exter-
nal frustration, instead of
directing the resulting hatred
constructively against the
source of the oppression.
Women must strive to overcome
this tendency, because what-
ever political direction we
take, it will be too important
to be frittered away in self-
hatred. It is quite falla-
cious to say ‘people who hate
find their ability to love
atrophied.' Please; let's be
honest. Human love is very
freely mixed with hatred.

The "Women Hate" point is a

very weak and paranoid one,

and it is used to reinforce

the other point: that abor-
tion is murder.

The only alternatives offered
are the pill, vasectomy,
condom, and advice that can
only be offered in indiffer-
ence or ignorance. There is
NO completely effective, re-
versible, safe means of con-
traception. The side effects
of the birth control pill are
well known, and they are side

A House of

A group of women is establish-
ing a Women's House in St. Paul
for both temporary housing and
for social and cultural activi-
ties.

The Women's House will be a
place where Twin Cities women
and their children can stay
during critical periods. As a
social and cultural center the
house will provide space for
meetings, classes, child care,
a women's library, small dis-
cussions and a "room of one's

effects that do kill and crip-
ple women. Furthermore, the
pill is not completely effec-
tive. The failure rate is
given at between one and five
percent. If it is one per-
cent, then of the eight and a
half million women taking the
pill, eighty-five thousand
will suffer an unwanted preg-
nancy. Must they be forced

to go through with it? Must
any woman be forced? Who,
after all, is more fit to de-
cide whether or not any woman
has the money, the energy, the
time to undergo pregnancy?
Marjorie Mecklenberg or presi-
dent what's-his-name? Paul
Ehrlich or the pope? The Min-
nesota state legislature?
Certainly not. The person
who is the most qualified to
decide is the woman herself,
because it is she who makes
the sacrifices.

"Population control is es-
sential," the article says.
But population control is not
the issue at all. "Popula-
tion control" is something
practiced by power-trippers
who get a kick out of mani-
pulating others. Population
control is what happened when
the Pill was originally ex-
perimented with, with Puerto
Rican women used as guinea
pigs. Population control is
what happens when black women
and women on welfare are
sterilized without their know-
ledge or consent. Population
control is what's happening
now in Southeast Asia, where
they're trying out a risky
birth control injection.
Population control is also
genocide, and we deplore it
and want no part of it. What
we want is for people to be
able to control their own
bodies and lives, which might
wind up being to the disad-
vantage of those who have
taken the decision away, and
want to control their stock-
pile of cannon fodder.

You're damned right "rich,
white establishment males use
the abortion issue to keep
women down." If we had the

One’s Own

means to control our own
bodies, this would have all
kinds of repercussions with
our psyches and with society.
If women were not constantly
tormented by the fear of un-
wanted pregnancy, there could
be no keeping us down.

Of course a fetus has life,
but then, so do carrots and
frogs, and so, at one time,
did the hamburger you ate for
lunch. Nobody calls them
"human." There are those who
feel that fetal life is human
life, and their opinion is to
be respected in a democratic
fashion, but this minority
has no right to impose its
will on the majority. No one
should be forced into an abor-
tion, nor should be forced
out of it. The decision must
be the responsibility of the
individual woman.

There is a final reality
that must be faced: the
reality of the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of
women each year at the hands
of illegal abortionists under
conditions that are shocking
and humiliating and filthy
and inhumane. Also not to be
forgotten are the thousands
of unwanted children whose
parents torture them: starve
them, break their bones, burn
them with cigarette butts,
hold them in boiling water.
Both are forms of human misery
that could be largely eradi-
cated by safe, legal abortion.

In early March the Women's
National Abortion Action
Coalition will hold an inter-
national tribunal on the sub-
ject of abortion, contracep-
tion, and forced steriliza-
tion. Women who have had
abortions or have been forci-
bly sterilized are urged to

testify. All are welcome to
attend. Simone de Beauvoir,
herself guilty of controlling

her own body, will be chair-
person. Cheap transportation

will be provided. For more

Ms. Jirak says:
"I agree totally with Ms.
Retsinas' comments about
man-hating. My remarks
were directed to a very
small minority and were
meant as a cautionary note
against the dangers of ex-
cessive bitterness and cul-
tivated hatred. I apologize
for not expressing that more
clearly.

I also agree that all peo-
ple should control their own
bodies. That is why I can't
agree with abortion (as much
as that would simplify
life): abortion denies the
child all control over her
(or his) own body."

Aquarius is often called
the sign of the procrastin-
ator and Arcotti--as an
Aquarius of the first water
--thus duly sits to compose
this column mere hours be-
fore deadline.

This is not, of course, to
suggest that Aquarius is
lazy. Far from it, she is
the living exemplar of the
adage, “If you want some-
thing done, ask a busy per-
son to do it."

Women of the Waterbearer's
sign have much to learn from
the greatest of their breed-
-women like Virginia Woolf,
Elizabeth Blackwell, Susan
B. Anthony, Gertrude Stein,
Susan Sontag, Amy Lowell--
and what these women teach
is the lesson of concentra-
ted energy. Any common-
place Aquarian (Aquarienne?)
has energy to spare, but she
deludes herself that it is
boundless and squanders it
in meaningless projects.

Rumors abound about this
eleventh zodiacal sign, most
of them flattering but mis-
leading. So, in an orderly
fashion not at all typical
of the sign, let us examine
several of these myths and

Q,

the circumstances that give
rise to them.

1. Altruism. Aquarius be-
ing conversationally promis-
cuous, her social manner
suggests that she is a true
egalitarian, associating
with persons of any class,
color, creed or sex. Alas,
the lass too often is spur-
red less by humanitarian in-
terest than by fascination
with the unusual, for Aquar-
ius commits herself sélect-
ively and then usually to
those she considers of her
own superior mentality. If
you have ever felt frauded
by Aquarian "altruism," bear

in mind that this sign above

all is able to love mankind
and dislike people.

2. Eccentricity. Ah, ec-
centricity. The Aquarius
female is oft pictured as
a strange old lady who in-
sists on wearing tennis
shoes in winter to match her
straw fedora. An exaggera-
tion, that, but Aquarius
herself is prone to exagger-
ate, whence springs many of
those curious mannerisms of
which astrologers love to
gossip.

Aquarius occurs when the
sun, opposite the sign it
rules, is weakest; the Aqua-
rius ego is the weakest in
the zodiac. Hold the jeers

momentarily: Aquarius exag-

gerates herself because she
fears she'd be overlooked
if she didn't. Contradict-
ory Aquarius desperately
wants to stand out from the
masses of humanity--which
she professes to love.

3. Loyalty. Although each
Aquarian will have a differ-
ent excuse for her aloof-
ness, all are difficult to
know well. But once you've
penetrated her defenses,
you'll have to amputate her
from your life to be rid of
her. Probably Aquarius’ fin-
est capability is that of
loyal friendship, in which
sex is an optional part.

To understand Aquarius,
watch your reactions as the
sun transits that sign.
People curse the midwinter
cold; they've left their
boots at home and are light-
ly dressed. Spring, still
months away, seems to hang
in the air, and the omni-
present snow insults our
expectations. Just so, Aqua-
rius lives in the future and
is impatient with the pre-
sent.
