**Dr. Wolf Analyzes Women's Roles**

**Linda Fowler**

Dr. Wolf is a nationally known sociologist, a feminist, and founder of the Denver chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). She is a professor at Colorado Women’s College (CWC) where she teaches a course on women in social situations. With the termination of the academic year, she will leave CWC to become head of the sociology department at Ohio Wesleyan University.

I interviewed Dr. Wolf in her office at CWC. We talked about the influence of various kinds of social structures on the development and behavior of women in the United States today, about the development of women within the family, and through groups of other women within the Women’s Movement.

**BMR:** Dr. Wolf, could you comment on the influences of the American family on the development of women?  
**Dr. Wolf:** A while ago I thought the nuclear family was the worst thing that could happen to women. It’s been an absolute disaster. And I thought perhaps communal living might be the answer. But then I did a study of three mountain communes, and almost without exception, women seemed to be carrying the load—doing all the work. And men are doing what I call the new role for men, the male drone role where they expect all the traditional privileges but none of the traditional responsibilities. The best of all possible worlds. So I don’t think that's the answer. What we're looking for is a real sharing of roles; a blurring of roles. And the term “unisex” doesn’t frighten me one bit.

I think we're going to go on having family units of some kind. What kind of unit would provide openness for every individual to develop? I think maybe in some ways a small family is better than a large one; mostly because of cross-cultural research which points out that when there are lots of male and female adults there is a division of labor, and it seems to go along sexual lines; there isn't a crossover.

**Raising Children Collectively**

**BMR:** What do you see as possibly developing for a family situation? Obviously, the commune isn't the answer. It’s pretty evident to me that in most communal situations there are certain surface differences that are quite different from the society at large, but when you come down to the basic interpersonal relationships they are exactly the same as they have been; so that doesn’t answer the question. What do you think about the collective as a system of child-rearing and family integration where several families might live together or in the same area? The raising of children is done collectively by the entire group.  
**Wolf:** I think so far it’s one of the best ways, and certainly for children. Children cease to be the responsibility of some poor woman basically and of the couple basically, and should and do sometimes become the responsibility of the whole collective. I think, probably, the best places I've seen for women, even though they haven't lasted very long, are those that have been in cities and people all work outside the home. They are families living together in a big house or on a farm and go into town to work—like in Boulder on the Nelson Road place. There you have a lot of problems, but I think maybe it’s more conducive to the development of women.

**BMR:** Do you think there is a significant difference between women who are functioning in marriage and women who are functioning more or less alone? Do you think there are any differences in the pressures that are felt in their ability to develop as individuals?  
**Wolf:** I think it’s probably easier to develop if you're living alone and you can choose friends without pressure. I think we should have great compassion for the housewife. Financially and emotionally there is a great amount of pressure for her to stay where she is and not change; and those who do manage to isolate themselves from this situation need support. The Women's Movement is providing this support in all kinds of unlikely places that a few years ago seemed hard to get to. We who have some awareness can't simply step away from all this—we've got to help one another—we need each other—we need the grassroots—we've got to help other women.

**Middle Class—Working Class**

**BMR:** It seems to me that it’s often very difficult to get this kind of awareness from the middle-class woman about what her own personal and social situation really is, because she has privilege to make her feel she has freedom and they are not the same thing at all. Working and lower-class women, on the other hand, rarely have the same kind of privilege. Their oppression is much more overt and they can see it more clearly.  
**Wolf:** They see economic oppression more clearly; they do not see interpersonal oppression as clearly and this has always been the case. We have to face some kinds of real things that occur in terms of communication. Communication goes from the top down—how the image of upper and middle-class women is emulated by working-class women. If you can get people to realize that, that’s an important first step.

**BMR:** Are you talking about taking steps to reach women in middle and upper-class communities as a means of influencing those women who are in lower socio-economic groups?  
**Wolf:** I think these steps have already been taken—in television, certainly a lot in magazines. A few years ago women who were in the Women’s Liberation Movement were funny; humor in a kind of scaffolding fashion (you laugh and then you destroy). It’s not happening too much now. This has made it acceptable for poor women who depend on a job and have been afraid to have Women’s Liberation attached to their name. Afraid to be other than, quote, feminine. You've got to get support from other women.

**BMR:** What things do you think begin to happen when women come together in groups within the Women's Movement? We talked about women functioning alone and also within the family. But then you go on to women functioning in groups of women. There seem to be changes that occur when this happens.  
**Wolf:** I think probably one of the great things about the Women’s Movement is that we have come to desire and like our own company, and we didn't used to. To go out with women was considered the worst kind of thing to do. You know, “Can't you do better than that?” Part of the whole horrible picture of hating ourselves, hating one another and judging everything in terms of the dominant class ideology—male. I don't think this happens so much anymore. I think women who are involved in the movement really enjoy the company of other women and really like women as individuals. This great sense of solidarity has come through the movement.

**Radicals in the Movement**

**BMR:** Do you feel that radicalism within the women’s movement has value?  
**Wolf:** It frightens some women; for some it is absolutely terrifying. If you say anything in terms of the family structure it scares them.  
**BMR:** Nothing is going to change, really, in the society until the family itself changes. This is the keystone.  
**Wolf:** This is why I felt reluctant in terms of what the future might bring even if you have a communal situation or if you have families living together; the kernel of the family is the same thing. Nothing changes. It’s like a raisin pie in which the raisins are in a certain relationship to each other: you can transport the pie all over the place but nothing changes internally.  
**BMR:** There is a surfacing now of radical Lesbians in the Women's Movement. What sort of effect do you think this is having on the movement and on societal structure generally?  
**Wolf:** I think Lesbian women are a very valuable part of the Women’s Liberation Movement. I think we have to include all women in the liberation movement. Probably when I came face to face with it, was when I, as a member of NOW, was called a Lesbian. At first I said, “Oh no. No, no.” And then you think, “Goddamit, what are you trying to beat me with?” I don’t think we should let this be a club.  
**BMR:** This is one of the most potent things to hit women with because this is something that definitely steps outside of the male-oriented culture and therefore is quite a threat to the patriarchy. Thereby it is a threat to women who are still very much identified with the patriarchy. The lifestyles that are developing within the Lesbian community are certainly radically different from the nuclear family unit that holds the whole society together. And this may be something of a key to what is needed to change the society as a whole. There is an absence of dominance-subordinance patterns and sometimes collective child-rearing in collective households. Do you think this might begin to really change things?  
**Wolf:** I think that’s fine if it does. I don't think it’s happening with great enough frequency to have any effect at all. What worries me is that there will be a kind of repressiveness. Economic situations, political situations have not been very conducive to an openness. There is a fear, as with the sexual preference bill in Boulder, and if there is enough momentum here I think it will have an effect of beating people back into closets, back into kitchens. And these hard-fought gains of all of us in terms of making life a little more decent for all kinds of people—I mean how many gains can we hold on to?

**Gays Meet Vice Chief**

At a recent meeting with Captain Jerry Kennedy, Denver Vice Bureau chief, Gay Coalition representatives discussed harassment of gays by vice squad officers in gay bars. Marge Johnson, coalition member, said that on various occasions vice squad officers had told women in The Three Sisters Bar, “We just came to look at all the pretty little dykes,” and “Don’t get uptight, girls—we just came to watch.” She also told Kennedy that vice officers have tried to solicit dates from female customers in the bar. “This is unprofessional conduct,” she said, and pointed out that Lesbians believe vice squad officers go there to provoke trouble.

Kennedy replied that to his knowledge no vice squad officer had recorded in the bureau log having been at The Three Sisters. He suggested that the bar managers keep a log of vice officer visits to the bar and that women record the name, physical description, and officer’s badge number and file a complaint with Kennedy if they feel they've been harassed.

Sometimes vice officers work undercover and, therefore, are not obligated to provide identification when requested to, according to Kennedy. He pointed out, however, that customers could get license plate numbers and turn them in to him.

He said he instructs vice bureau officers to “enforce the law and keep your opinions to yourselves.”

**Rape is a Vice**

Ms. Johnson also asked Kennedy whether the vice bureau is involved in surveillance of gay groups in Denver and in investigation of rape cases. He replied “no” to both questions. Ms. Johnson said she considers rape to be a vice.

Coalition members said they wanted to hold “education sessions” with vice officers and to get a liaison officer between the vice bureau and the gay community. Kennedy agreed to these requests. Gerald Gerash of the Gay Coalition pointed out to Kennedy that being gay is not the problem, per se—homophobia (fear of homosexuality) is the problem that needs to be dealt with.

Coalition representatives also recommended to Kennedy that there be gay representation on the vice bureau. Kennedy responded, “Do you have anyone to suggest?” Coalition people said not at the moment, but that they would communicate Kennedy's interest to the gay community. Any gay person who is interested in working on the vice squad is asked to contact Cordell Boyce at the Coalition office, 831-8838.
