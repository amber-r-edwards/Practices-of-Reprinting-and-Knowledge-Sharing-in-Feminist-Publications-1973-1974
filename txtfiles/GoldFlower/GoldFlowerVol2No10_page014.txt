PSYCHOLOGY and WOMEN

AT MARSHALL 'U' HIGH SCHOOL

Dr. Lois Erickson at the
University of Minnesota has
developed a curriculum to pro
mote psychological maturity
in women using a developmental
framework derived from the
theories of Jane Loevinger
and Lawrence Kohlberg.

Loevinger's theory postulates
that an individual's ego develops
from a young child's differentiation
between self and non-self
through various stages of emotional
and social development to a possible
"integrated" stage in which complexity
of thought, perception of choices,
respect for others' autonomy, and a
valuing of justice are predominate.
Kohlberg's position is that moral
development progresses along stages
of growth which increasingly integrate
the concept of justice—from a
"what's in it for me" instrumental
hedonism orientation toward a possible
stage of moral decision-making based
on principles of universal justice.
Thus, they both see human growth as
progressing along stages—which direc-
tion can provide a goal for education.

This goal, movement along the
developmental stages of growth has
become the major objective in Erickson's
curriculum for women.

Extensive research indicates that
American men are more likely to reach
higher stages of development than
American women. Most women remain
on stage 3, social conforming orientation,
while about four times as many men
move ahead toward the more complex
modes of thought. Of importance, it has
been found that no difference in moral
maturity exists between the sexes until
adolescence, at which time girls plateau
in psychological growth while boys
continue the movement toward higher
stages.

Dr. Erickson said several studies
demonstrate that girls "sell out" their
competency motivation sometime in high
school and get anchored in a lifestyle
that reinforces the middle stages of
growth, the social compromising stage.
The theories acknowledge this inconsistency
will lead to an erosion of women's maturity,
and the research bears this out.

"We've talked about it so long, now we
must do something about it!" is Erickson's
position.

The curriculum model developed by
Erickson used a "Learning Psychology
by doing psychology" format first set
forth by John Dewey. Field interviewing
of girls and women across the life span
provided a means of viewing the process
of female development through different
ages, stages, and tasks. In the seminar
sessions the high school women reflected
about and integrated their interview data
and also focused on current articles on
the women's movement and related literary
works. A continuous thru-way focus was
maintained between the interview experiences,
the works of literature, and the examination
of "the self." Multiple assessments were
run on the class and on the Loevinger
measures of ego maturity and on the Kohlberg
measure of moral maturity.

This curriculum is the first in a series
of classes being developed to examine
sex roles and personal growth. A two-person
relationship class and a parenting class
(both with males) are now being piloted
and researched.
