lesbianism in minn. 4 blinded justice

june 1973 vol. 2 no. 3

Malvina Reynolds is a songwriter with an  
active conscience and a perpetual overabun-  
dance of material. "I have to fight off sub-  
jects," she says. "People are always sug-  
gesting them to me. ‘Have you written any-  
thing about the Aswan Dam?' It bugs me;  
they don't know anything about songwriting."  

When I met Malvina at the Walker Art Cen-  
ter last month, she had just given in to the  
urge to write about Watergate. Having re-  
sisted the issue for months because "you  
can't satirize the satire," she had suddenly  
been taken by the phrase, “meet me at the  
Watergate." Soon she was singing the new  
song over the telephone to Walter Cronkite,  
and a few days later, appeared with it on  
the CBS Evening News.  

As with the Watergate song, "Songwriting  
happens when it happens." Most often, she  
is struck by something she sees or hears and  
the song forms on the spot.  

"I can't write sitting down quietly in a  
room. Usually I'm moving, riding in a car  
or on a bus."  

The 72-year-old resident of Berkeley,  
California, spends most of her time song-  
writing and performing. She has been at it  
for 30 years, after discovering that her doc-  
torate in literature was helpful when solving  
crossword puzzles, but not when looking for  
jobs.  

"I never could get a job teaching. Nobody  
told me why, but I have my own ideas on the  
matter."  

Malvina's songwriting began when she "fell  
in with people like Pete Seeger, Earl Robin-  
son, and Woody Guthrie who were interested in  
our folk heritage."  

"They brought in powerful music, understa-  
ted musically and lyrically. I got a guitar,  
learned a few chords and that's all I know  
now."  

At first Malvina's work was performed by  
others - Seeger, Judy Collins, Joan Baez,  
Harry Belafonte - which accounts for our  
close familiarity with her songs but not her  
name.  

She comments, "Other singers kept doing my  
popular songs over and over. I had other  
good songs no one knew about. So I decided  
to do it myself.  

"I am not a great singer by any means. But  
nobody minds. If I had a better voice, I  
would have gone in a different direction,  
not as good a direction. I would have shown  
off my voice."  

Malvina Reynolds Sings  
for People who Agree  

An Interview  

By Susan  
Cushman  

Instead, Malvina has become an irresistible  
social and political critic whose beliefs are  
so tunefully presented that one can't help  
but hum along.  

Malvina frequently denies that her own  
songs are folk songs, because one person  
can't write an instant tradition. Rather,  
she says she writes what sounds like folk  
songs.  

Folk songs have a durability which sur-  
vives countless renditions, and perhaps Mal-  
vina's songs sound folkish because you never  
really get tired of them. Before I attended  
her concert at the Walker, I was sure that  
my capacity for “Little Boxes" had been fil-  
led years ago. But Malvina knew better than  
I what effect the well-known words and tune  
could have on an audience.  

The fun is in the knowing  

The song was flawlessly funny, mostly be-  
cause of the exact fit between the knowing  
delivery and the equally knowing reception.  
Most of us had grown up with this song,  
singing it at our concerts, around our camp-  
fires, in our avant-garde church services,  
and unanimously confirming its complaint.  

As Malvina sang it, I realized that was one  
agreement we never quite outgrew; ten years  
later and we still didn't like those houses,  
much less, their way of life:  

Little boxes on the hillside,  

Little boxes made of ticky-tacky,  
Little boxes on the hillside,  

Little boxes all the same;  

There's a green one and a pink one  

And a blue one and a yellow one  

And they're all made out of ticky-tacky  
And they all look just the same.  

Speaking before the concert, Malvina men-  
tioned that a breakfast cereal manufacturer  
had once approached her requesting permission  
to use "Little Boxes" in a commercial. She  
refused.  

Most of Malvina's work has a laugh in it  
which surfaces in more or less painful ways.  
She comments that her songs are "largely  
satire. Something can't be funny unless it  
has bite in it that hurts, that matters.”  

One of my favorites is "We Hate To See  
Them Go," a wry tune describing a dream  
about sending "the gentlemen of distinction  
in the Army."

First of Two Parts

Ten per cent of Minnesota
women belong to one of the
most unprotected minorities
in the state. Ten per cent
is the amount of Minnesota
women who are lesbians, esti-
mates Karen Browne, founder
of the Lesbian Resource Cen-
ter, 710 W. 22nd St., Minnea-
polis.

Lesbians are doubly defined
as "second-class citizens" by
society because they are wom-
en and because they prefer
members of their own sex.

Historically, lesbians have
been condemned by law in ev-
ery state. Descriptions of
homosexuality as "lewd and
lascivious behavior" and “a
crime against nature" are
used by several states in
their statutes. If female,
as well as male, homosexuals
aren't specified by some
states' laws, it has been be-
cause females were considered
less important socially.

In Minnesota, terms against
homosexuality aren't quite so
harsh but the lack of civil
rights for gays is the same.

Legislature Says ‘No’

In May, in the final
squeeze of the state's leg-
islative session, a confer-
ence committee from both
houses rejected a provision
to the Human Rights Act pro-
hibiting discrimination in
employment to homosexuals.

The gay provision, which
was introduced by Sen. Nick
Coleman, had passed earlier
in the Senate. Coleman's
original proposal, which
passed in the Senate's Sub-
Committee on Judicial Admin-
istration in mid-April and
the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee a few weeks later also
protected gays in housing.

The gay provision itself
was an amendment to a broader
bill drafted by Sam Richard-
son, State Commissioner of
Human Rights.

Richardson's original draft
did finally pass through the
conference committee. It
prohibits discrimination in
the areas of housing, employ-
ment, education and public
services because of marital
status, physical or mental
disability, or status as a
welfare recipient.

No other state has passed
civil rights legislation for
gays. However, in New York
City an executive order was
issued forbidding discrimina-
tion against gays in govern-
ment employment. An Ann Ar-
bor, Michigan executive order

expanded the prohibition to
private employers.

In the Minnesota House,
gays have suffered defeat
this session in another piece
of legislation. The "Sodomy
Bill" would have legalized
homosexuality among consent-
ing adults. But Steve
Endean, lobbyist for the
Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union (MCLU) believes that
the defeat is just temporary
and that the bill will be
brought up again when the
legislature re-convenes next
January.

If the "Sodomy Bill" ever
becomes law, Minnesota will
join only seven other states
which have similar legisla-
tion.

Illinois pioneered legisla-
tive acceptance of homosexua-
lity between consenting
adults in 1961. Connecticut,
Colorado, Delaware, Ohio and
Hawaii all approved similar
legislation within the last
one and one-half years.

In Florida and Washington
D.C. restrictive laws simi-
lar to the present Minnesota
law were thrown out by the
courts as unconstitutional.

Mike Weatherbee, co-ordina-
tor of MCLU and Browne
acknowledge the importance of
the Human Rights Amendment as
a legal precedent.

The only national basis for
civil rights now is the 14th
Amendment to the US Constitu-
tion which prevents the gov-
ernment from discriminating

unless there's a rational rea-

son. "Housing isn't a case
here, though, because most of
it is privately owned. And
the amendment doesn't protect
against private employers,
either," Weatherbee pointed
out.

Because of the lack of
jurisdiction, no cases have
ever been brought against a
private employer or landlord
in Minnesota. "We (the MCLU)
frequently have to turn down
cases because there is no
law," said Weatherbee.

Landlords Discriminate

There are many cases in
Minneapolis where landlords
and employers have discrimin-
ated against lesbians, how-
ever.

Browne and her roommate,
Cindy Hanson, a former direc-
tor of Gay House and founder
of Gay Community Services
spent two months trying to
find an apartment. But after
each landlord asked where the
women worked, Browne and Han-
son were always turned down.

“Finally, we just told a
landlord that we worked in a
‘straight’ place and we got

an apartment," said Browne.

For the professional woman,
a major problem is hiding the
fact that she is a lesbian.

Helen Livingston teaches
first grade in a Catholic
grade school. Because of the
small size of the faculty,
she finally felt that she
couldn't keep her lesbianism
a secret anymore.

The school didn't fire her
directly but "ambiguously"
refused to renew her contract
for next year because of
“conflicting philosophies."

"Professional women who
come into contact with people
more than factory workers are
more likely to get fired,"
said Livingston.

Organized religion, espec-
ially the Catholic Church,
remains one of the main ob-
stacles to lesbians. Tradi-
tionally, religion has con-
demned everything but pro-
creative sex. Anything else
was "sinful" and "perverse."

But some branches of Pro-
testantism are changing.
Browne notes that a few city
churches are helping to fund
the Lesbian Resource Center.
(Other funds come from priv-
ate foundations and personal
contributions.)

Religion and government are
the main institutions which
prolong basic societal beliefs
against homosexuality. Even
if a lesbian can overcome the
religious obstacle by removing
herself directly from the
church, there are always more
concrete and visible barriers
within the government.

Government Says ‘No’

According to a 1969 issue of
Humanist magazine, "Federal
government serves to set the
tone and example of the syste-
matic exclusion of this sig-
nificantly large minority of
its citizens from full parti-
cipation in the society in
which they live, and their
systematic relegation to sec-
ond class citizens."

The "significantly large
minority" of lesbians in the
country is about 10 million,
estimate Del Martin and Phyl-
lis Lyon, co-founders of the
national lesbian organization,
Daughters of Bilitis.

The federal government's
disapproval of lesbianism is
expressed mainly in the civil
service.

The government still treats
homosexuality as an emotional
disturbance and emphasizes
psychoanalysis as a "cure."

“Homosexuality has been de-
fined into a sickness or dis-
order through subjective, per-
sonal, social, moral, cultur-
al and religious value judge-

No One

ments...the ones who accuse
don't do adequate scientific
study to validate what they
say," states the Humanist
article.

However, the Kinsey report
on Sexual Behavior in the
Human Female documents studies
of both sexes substantiating
that homosexuality is not a
"sickness" but a "preference."

The civil service prejudice
is stated in its list of gen-
eral qualifications. "Persons
about whom there is evidence
that they have engaged in...
homosexual...acts, without
evidence of rehabilitation,
are not suitable for Federal
employment." This rule is
without regard for the per-
son's individual qualifica-
tions for the job.

Stemming largely from the
McCarthy period of the 1950's,
the civil service's opinion
is that homosexuals will have
a "disrupting effect upon the
morale and efficiency of any
organization." Yet the rela-
tion between a worker's off-
the-job behavior and her on-
the-job efficiency is never
explained.

There is an obvious incon-
gruence in the government's
position. While civil service
is fearful of placing a homo-
sexual in an office of hetero-
sexuals, "The government
wouldn't hesitate to put a
Negro in an office of racists
or a Jew in an office of anti-
Semites," concludes the Huma-
nist article.

Currently, the government
is able to fire workers
because in the government's
definition, homosexuality is
a "rational basis" for firing,
said Weatherbee.

Again, the professional

lesbians are the ones most
affected by this policy.
This includes teachers, women
in the medical profession and
any other profession licensed
by the state.

The Human Rights amendment
could locally challenge gov-
ernmental hiring practices.

Courts Say ‘Maybe’

Discrimination in housing
and employment are problems
faced by both lesbians and
male homosexuals. Yet, gay
women are faced with another
legal problem--of having to
prove that they are "fit"
mothers.

Weatherbee said that there
have been several MCLU cases
where an ex-husband or rela-
tive has tried to get the
children taken away from
their lesbian mother.

Browne explained the only
"semi-victory" in the nation

(continued on page 4)

people change, you told me
and it isn't right for us

to stay in each other's arms
there is more for each of us
somewhere else

we will be stronger apart

we will find new energies
and I say I understand

we have gone through our
changes

I hate that word

I let you pack

we laugh, we are happy

for what has passed between
us and we have shared love
and I say I understand

it is not good to be together
if we need someone else
someone new and different

yet that night I reach across the

emptiness searching for your
warmth and I am cold and
alone

I scream and no one hears me
those screams in the night
that no one ever hears

Lesbianism == continued from page 3

for a lesbian mother regard-
ing child custody.

Two Washington men chal-
lenged their ex-wives who
were living together with
both women's children. With
the aid of a woman lawyer and
favorable testimony by sever-
al social workers, the women
retained custody of their
children.

But the women were ordered
by the court to no longer
live together nor even see
each other in the presence of
their children.

The MCLU has never had a
call concerning attempts by
the Welfare Department to
gain custody of children just
because their mother is a
lesbian.

Welfare tries to gain cust-
ody only if there is also a
reason to believe that the
mother isn't caring for her
children properly.

If a mother has to go to
court to retain custody of
her children, "most attorneys
will tell her to hush up her
lesbianism," said Browne.

Discrimination of lesbians
appears in written and un-
written forms.

Browne had much difficulty
in trying to find a landlord
that would rent to a "Lesbian
Resource Center." And once a
location for the center was
found, the telephone and pub-
lic utilities companies were
reluctant to connect their
services.

Browne, who is one of the
three women at the Lesbian
Resource Center who split a
$500 a month salary, predicts
difficulties the center might
have when it applies to the
state for incorporation.
"It's just hard for any gay
group to get a tax-exempt
status," she said.

The Lesbian Resource Center
as a whole has no definite
political philosophy so that
“all sorts of people feel
comfortable here," said
Browne.

"Yet, most lesbians are
obviously feminists," con-
cluded Livingston.

Few Alternatives

Before the Lesbian Resource
Center opened in mid-January,
Twin City lesbians had only
two places where they could
socialize as lesbians, Gay
House and "the bar."

But Gay House is male dom-
inated and never really at-
tracted that many women, said
Hanson.

Livingston continued,
"There was a lot of solidari-
ty at first but things kind
of died out. More women come
to the center than ever would
have come to Gay House."

In Minnesota there aren't
any laws, such as those in
California, which prohibit
kissing and handholding by
members of the same sex in a
bar. "Or if there are, no
one ever enforces them,"
Browne said.

Gay bars in the Twin Cities
are managed by "straights"
who can take advantage of the
fact that homosexuals have al-
most no place else to go to-
gether.

Hanson implied that the gay
bars are Chicago-syndicate
controlled and can afford to
"pay off" police so that the
bar's clientele won't be has-
sled.

If this is true or not,
Browne said that "the police
haven't given us any trouble
at the bars or the center."

Hanson thinks that a
"straight" syndicate can mo-
nopolize gay bars because the
high price of a liquor
license makes it impossible
for most gays to buy their
own bar.

Policeman Causes Trouble

Besides, owning a gay bar
can be a risky business.

A couple of years ago a
lesbian woman owned a gay bar
in a St. Paul suburb. One
night an off-duty policeman
came into the bar, allegedly
caused some confusion, then
called into his station with
false reports about what the
women were doing in the bar.

Upon closer examination of
the incident by a senior of-
ficer it was determined that
the policeman was at fault
for the disturbance and he
was subsequently discharged
from the force.

But the fear of being
exposed through publicity of
the event made most of the
lesbian patrons stay away
from the bar after that. The
bar soon closed.

Twin City lesbians' rela-
tive freedom from problems
with the police is a contrast
to Martin and Lyon's reports
in Lesbian/Woman of the con-
stant harassment of Califor-
nia police towards lesbians.

For women who don't care to
go to the bars, the Lesbian
Resource Center offers a
variety of activities. Dis-
cussion groups, theater,
films, dances, a coffeehouse
and softball team give les-
bians a chance to be in con-
tact with other lesbians.

Radicalesbians

The level of organized po-
litical activity varies among
lesbians of the Twin Cities
as it does among lesbians of
the country.

"Radicalesbians" are usual-
ly younger women who identify
politically and socially with
their minority. At the other
end of the spectrum are wom-
en, usually older, who are
so well established in their
communities and jobs that
they feel they stand to lose
too much personally if they
become politically active.
But all lesbians agree that
their rights are essential.
As Martin and Lyons state in
Lesbian/Woman, "No longer is
toleration acceptable. The
lesbians, along with all op-
pressed people, want freedom
and we want it now!"

lation to gay activist, James

Wry songs.

The bankers and the diplomats are going  
in the Army,  

It seemed too bad to keep them from the  
wars they love to plan,  

We're all of us contented that they'll  
fight a dandy war,  

They don't need propaganda, they know  
what they're fighting for.  

They'll march away with dignity and in  
the best of form,  

And we'll just keep the laddies here to  
keep the lassies warm.  

Malvina does not intend that her songs  
carry messages. "I sing what people have  
formulated anyway. I address myself to  
those who agree with me or are in a fringe  
limbo."  

Since many of her concerts are benefit  
performances for causes such as the women's  
and peace movements, the Ellsberg defense,  
and the American Indian Movement, her  
audience is naturally selected for her en-  
lightened and engaging point of view.  

Malvina's interest in women's issues is  
long-standing, as evidenced by her equivocal  
"We Don't Need the Men" written in 1958.  
The chorus chortles:  

We don't need the men, We don't need the  
men,  

We don't need to have them around, except  
for now and then.  

They can come to see us when we need to  
move the piano,  

Otherwise they can stay at home and read  
about the White Sox.  

Blind Justice  

Local Style  

(Cont’d)  

Fifteen years ago, Malvina considered this  
song a tongue-in-cheek exercise; the raucous  
enthusiasm it produced at her concert sug-  
gests that today the song carries more ser-  
ious implications.  

With a little less good humor, "No Room"  
recognizes the rise of world hunger and over-  
population:  

No room! No room! No room!  

Holy is the fetus,  

But babies once born are simply human,  

And if they die in the streets of  
Calcutta  

No one will notice but their ma,  

And ain't that just like a woman.  

The wider the grin, it seems, the deeper  
the bite.  

I seldom meet people who are satisfied  
with their lives, and it surprised me to so  
easily recognize a contented person when I  
saw her. Malvina Reynolds truly likes her  
life, and with good reason. She lives by  
her talents and her convictions, supporting  
herself by doing what she likes best on her  
own terms.  

Malvina Reynolds works without an agent.

with her, write her at 2027 Parker St.,

When I moved to Minneapolis last year I  
was surprised and gratified to see a public  
feminist display not far from my door. A  

larger than lifesize statue of a woman tak-  
ing notes prominently sat on the lawn of the  
Metropolitan School of Law a few blocks away  
from my apartment. "What a way to advertise  
for female law students," I cheerfully  
thought to myself, and if the door of the  
building had been open, I would have gone in  
to compliment the school on its ingenuity  
and enlightened politics.  

That locked door saved us all some embar-  
rassment. Only days later, I read in the  
morning paper that the statue was a throw-  
back to the fairly recent days when the  
building had housed a school for medical  
secretaries. Since that educational enter-  
prise had failed, the same founder was now  

attempting to establish the law school. Once  
the building had been relabeled, the statue  
was naturally considered inappropriate.  
Sculptural alteration was scheduled and soon  
came in the form of a black painted blind-  
fold and a pair of ironwork scales. Presto,  
and we viewed that great feminine character  
Blind Justice. So what if she was hunched  
over a desk and who cared that the notebook  
was a misplaced prop? At least she couldn't  
be mistaken for a prototypical law student.  
The school never got off the ground, and  
a "Space Available" sign eventually appeared  
at the statue's base. The fate of the sta-  
tue has not been announced, but her proven  
versatility will no doubt guarantee her a  
long, if somewhat curious, life.

Weather and the Real Woman

The women of Alexandria,  
Minnesota have come a long  
way.  
A discussion class on the women's  
movement brought local feminists together.  
Alexandria hasn't been the  
same. After the class was  
over, they decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-raising group.

Trap Door and T.V.

One of the women is Wendy  
Wallace. On weekdays, she  
pulls open a trap door in a  
building downtown and descends to a shop called "The  
Trap Door" where she and her  
mother sell carved gourds,  
silver rings, wicker baskets,  
wooden boxes, and other gifts.

On weekends, Wendy enters  
another door, that of the  
KCMT-TV station in Alexandria,  
and does the weekend weather.

Wendy has a long history  
of television work. When she  
was 15, she read the weather  
on TV in Fargo. Later, she  
did Unguentine and All-State  
Insurance commercials in California.

Women’s Work

She met little resistance  
when she applied for the job  
at KCMT; the job had already  
been pegged as "women's work"  
--the former weatherperson  
was a woman. Now, she says,  
if one of the talent is absent  
during the week, she substitutes in the weather slot,  
but never in any other. If  
the anchorman is gone, she  
will replace the weatherman,  
who replaces the sports announcer, who replaces the  
anchorman...

Unsatisfied with these conditions, she conceived a plan  
for another show, a show on  
women, and approached the  
station director with her  
idea. “I was shocked when he  
approved it," she said, and  
since February, Wendy has  
been hosting a 15-minute show  
called "What's New with Women"  
on Sundays at 12:15 pm.  
She has reported on such topics as welfare, divorce, and  
abortion, and has interviewed  
Carol Jetland, of the Minnesota Education Association  
Committee on Women.

Last fall an adult education  
class on the women's movement  
brought local feminists together,  
and since then Wendy's radicalization seems  
to have been prophesied in  
the name she and her husband  
Patrick gave to their 19-month-old daughter, Erin  
Pendrick. "Pendrick is a  
phonetic combination of our  
names...We took the 'Pen'  
from 'Wendy' and the 'drick' from 'Patrick.'"

Viewers and Colleagues

Viewer response has been  
disappointing. No one has  
written with comments on the  
issues she has presented.  
Several people have admired  
her hair. A couple of men  
have written her that they  
have fallen in love with her.  
Once, in a spirit of irony, a  
woman sent a poem (reprinted  
below) about motherhood "from  
her collection." Wendy said,  
"I read it as straight as I  
could and wanted a copy of the  
poem."

What is a mother?

A mother is soft hands and a  
warm heart.

A mother has lots of tears.  
She never runs out of them.

A mother is different.  
She never takes the last chop  
on the plate.

She likes chicken backs and  
necks.  
Dad and the kids don't.

When a mother dies, she goes  
to heaven.  
The coveted job of all:  
Sitting on soft, white,  
fluffy clouds  
Holding the angelic babies  
And wiping away their celestial tears  
With the corner of her apron.

Wendy feels she is not taken  
seriously by the men at  
the TV station and says she  
is not treated as a regular  
part of the staff. She is  
never invited to office parties  
or get-togethers, and is  
not treated with friendliness  
"as though it would not be  
proper." But, she says, "any  
time I pull a goof they all  
love me." Wendy says she  
"detests dresses," but one  
week when she substituted on  
another show, her clothes  
were supplied by a local  
dress shop. One day she wore  
a light blue dress complete  
with ruffles and lace. She  
wore her hair in pigtails.  
She says she felt like a 5-year-old  
on her way to a birthday party.  
When she arrived at the station, one  
of the men said, "Now you  
look like a real woman."

Three people wrote in.  
And there she gets the most.

'Feminist Librarian Rescues  
| Scarlett --- Portnoy Tags Along  

When Barb Caron began her  
job as the librarian in the  
Alexandria, Minnesota public  
library, she found that books  
like Portnoy's Complaint,  
Black Like Me, yoga and health  
books were kept behind the  
counter, and Gone with the  
Wind could not be checked out  
by anyone under 18.  

Today, a year later, those  
books are out on the shelf,  
along with such books as

and Madness, and William's

mothers, and career women.  

Solid Friends  

After the course was over,  
the women decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-  
raising group. They have  
since formed solid friend-  
ships and "helped each other  
through rough spots." Barb  
says the group "made me more  
comfortable with myself and  
gave me reinforcement." The  
group is now thinking of  
forming a speakers bureau.  

Barb has been introducing  
feminism to almost everyone  
in Alexandria. She teaches  
a mini-course in cooking to  
eight students from the local  
grade school. The course  
was open to everyone, but  
boys were the only ones who  
signed up!  

Expansion and Outreach  

Barb, who graduated in 1972  
from the College of St. Cath-  
erine, has revitalized the  
library physically as well as  
ordering new books. Along  
with a progressive Library  
Board, she has ordered new  
carpeting, shrubs, and paint.  

She has also expanded the  
library's services. She is

100 Boots Out of a Job  

Terminal Island, Calif.  

Eleanor  
Antin, has earned herself an  
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art  
(MOMA), New York, through an ingen-  
ious ongoing mailwork.  

100 Boots, a series of 50 postcards  
showing black rubber boots in drama-  
tic situations, is on view at MOMA  
through July 8—when the boots them-  
selves conclude their peripatetic ad-  
ventures with a stay in New York. In  
addition to the entire set of post-  
cards, the exhibition includes photo-  
graphic blow-ups of the boots' New  
York “crash pad."  

Executed over the past 2 1/2 years,  
Antin's 100 Boots was conceived as a  
means of circumventing the limitations  
of the gallery system. The postcards  
have been mailed at irregular inter-  
vals—ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks  
—to some thousand persons and insti-  
tutions around the world.  

As Antin describes it, she origin-  
ally thought of the work as a picar-  
esque novel, but later began to view  
the photographs as highlighted frames  
from a movie serial. Each postcard in-  
cludes a photograph of the boots,  

a title and data on the place and time  
of the photographs. All photographs  
were taken by Philip Steinmetz.  

The postcards were not necessar-  
ily mailed in sequence of occurrence.  
Instead, Antin reordered the events  
into a continuous narrative, which be-  
gins with the boots in conventional  
society, leads through their first  
crime ("100 Boots Trespass") and  
thence to a series of adventures, odd  
jobs and even an unhappy love affair.  

While most of the boots’ adventures  
have taken place in California (where  
Antin lives), their exploits will con-  
clude in New York when the MOMA ex-  
hibition closes. Jane Necol of the  
MOMA staff directed the exhibition,  
which is the first time the boots'  
wanderings will be fully displayed.

By Pat Monaghan

Lack of funds and the stig-
ma of being branded “the
other rape center" has forced
the feminist-oriented Rape
Crisis Center to close its
doors for the summer, but
staff members have indicated
an intention to reopen the
service after extensive re-
organization.

Joan Orke and Diane Sjer-
ven, in announcing the cen-
ter's temporary closure, laid
the blame to the center's
image as the area's second
rape counseling service. A
rape center at the Neighbor-
hood Involvement Program
(NIP) clinic, a social ser-
vice project of several
churches, opened slightly
before the Rape Crisis Cen-
ter.

Because of the existence
of two apparently similar
centers, funding agencies
"don't want to fund us, be-
cause they think it's a du-
plication of services," com-
plained Sjerven. “From their
point of view, it may be--
but there's a real difference
in the way rape victims are
treated at the two centers.”

Orke and Sjerven related
for "Gold Flower" the com-
plicated series of events
which led, last winter, to
the almost simultaneous es-
tablishment of two rape cen-
ters in Minneapolis.

According to Orke, who has
been active since last fall
in the movement to aid rape
victims, a women's group at
that time decided to open an
advocacy service patterned
upon the Washington, D.C.,
rape center. One member of
the group arranged a meeting
with the NIP management, to
explore the possibility of
assistance from that group.

When after extensive meet-
ings it became evident that
the two groups had different
philosophic intent, the wo-
men's group withdrew from
the NIP collaboration and
continued its plans indepen-
dently. NIP, however, estab-
lished its own center, open-
ing last December.

The Rape Crisis Center
opened in January--"probably
too soon," Orke admitted.
"But we felt pressured to
supply this choice of ser-
vices to women.

"We believe that women who
are raped should be able to
determine what's going to
happen to her, that she
should not be automatically
referred to counseling. NIP
is a counseling center; we
are an advocacy service. And
we also approach the issue
from a feminist point of
view."

Rape Crisis Center volun-
teers serve as advocates for
rape victims at the hospital
and police station, should
the victim request this ser-
vice. Volunteers also have
supplied transportation for
rape victims to safety.
Neither of these services are
offered by the NIP center.

"The main difference be-
tween the centers is the long
range goals," Sjerven said.
"We're interested in social
change. NIP is interested
only in treating the sym-
ptoms."

Since January the Rape
Crisis Center has operated
out of the Women's Counsel-
ing Service at Lyndale Ave.
and Lake St. However, lack
of funds has necessitated a
move by that agency to smal-

Lack of funds forces Rape
Center to close temporari-

ler quarters, and the Rape
Crisis Center lost its free
office space as a result.
With no funding and the
sudden need to rent space
for the center, the Rape
Crisis Center staff elected
to shut down its services
pending reorganization.
"Basically we still feel
a need for a 24-hour answer-
ing service, and to provide
advocacy as well as counsel-
ing," Orke said. Other
hoped-for services include
a library of rape-related
research, compilation of
statistics on occurrence of
rape in the Twin Cities
area, and a public education
program.

Sociologist says
rapists plan
their assaults

A Detroit sociologist, Nor-
man S. Goldner, reported re-
cently that his studies show
most rapes to be planned by
the attacker, a contention
that calls into question sev-
eral common presuppositions
about the crime.

Goldner's research results
were released recently in a
report by Susan Fogg of New-
house News Service.

According to Goldner, "pro-
vocation by the victim only
needs to be minimal" when the
rapist is already determined
to commit the act. This runs
counter to the popular belief
that women are implicated in
the crime through their
arousal of their attacker's
sexual interest--a belief
that leads police to care-
fully question a victim as to
her attire and responses when
attacked.

Goldner reported the crime
to be generally premeditated,
rarely spontaneous. The Wayne
State sociologist found in
studies of the crime that
few rapists (only 18 percent)
leave their own neighborhoods
in search of victims, pre-
ferring instead to strike in
a familiar locale.

Calling rape "the only
crime I know of in which the
victim must prove herself in-
nocent," Goldner said, "The
victim's only complicity may
be that she turned up at the
wrong place at the wrong
time. The only provocation
may be something she can't
help--like her age."

How to Have Intercourse...
Without Getting Screwed

Part V: Diseases

Venereal Diseases

A venereal disease is one that is transmit-
ted only through sexual contact, genital,
oral, or anal. Both major types, syphilis
and gonorrhea, can be cured easily if treated
in the early stages, but both can result in
permanent disability or death if untreated.

SYPHILIS

Symptoms: A symptom of the primary, or
first, stage of syphilis is the appearance of
a small sore or "chancre" on either the geni-
tal area or the anus, or even on lips, tongue,
and fingers. It appears from ten days to
three months after exposure to the disease
and may disappear without treatment after a
few days. This does not mean that the disease
has gone away; it has entered a secondary
stage, where it is highly contagious and can
do crippling damage to the body. In the sec-
ondary stage, symptoms include rashes, sore
throat, sore joints, headache, fever, and en-
larged glands. These symptoms may come and
go over a period of years. These symptoms
also eventually will disappear without treat-
ment. In the final stage of the disease, no
visible symptoms exist. However, untreated
syphilis will persist and ultimately can lead
to blindness, insanity, paralysis, heart dis-
ease, or death. A pregnant woman who has
syphilis can pass it on to newborn children,
who may be stillborn or blind.

Diagnosis and treatment: Certain diagnosis
can only be made through blood tests. These
are available without charge through public
health agencies in Seattle and most other
large cities. Through the use of penicillin,
syphilis can be successfully treated in its
early stages, and in the later stages, the
destructive processes can be stopped by treat-
ment.

GONORRHEA

Symptoms: Gonorrhea ("the clap") is usually
limited to the genitourinary organs, and it
is in these organs that the symptoms appear.
Female symptoms include pain upon urination,
inflammation of the rectum, swollen glands in
the genital area, and vaginal discharge.

More serious symptoms may occur, such as in-
flammation of the reproductive organs. How-
ever, a woman may have no symptoms at all,
except for slight discomfort while urinating,
and still be a highly contagious carrier of
the disease. The symptoms in males are more
obvious and include a burning sensation during
urination and a discharge of yellow pus. Fur-
ther complications include bladder infections
and a hard, tender swelling in the scrotum.

In both males and females, the untreated dis-
ease can lead to peritonitis, sterility, ar-
thritis, or irritation of the joints, and it
can affect the heart. Women can experience
additional complications that include a gen-
eralized infection of the uterus and ovarian
tubes called pelvic inflammatory disease.

This is associated with pain, fever, and ab-
cesses in the tubes, sometimes known as "pus
tubes."

Diagnosis and treatment: Gonorrhea is
usually diagnosed by use of laboratory tests
performed on discharge from infected organs.
Treatment at an early stage can cure the in-
fection. Women who are sexually active should
request an intracervical smear test for
gonorrhea at the same time they have a Pap
smear test.

PROTECTION FROM VENEREAL DISEASES

Venereal diseases are highly contagious and
highly dangerous. The only device that pro-
tects against venereal diseases is the condom,
and this does not offer complete protection!
Previous successful treatment for a venereal
disease is no protection against reinfection.
Since no immunity develops, people can be re-
infected. The only reliable protection
against a disabling venereal disease is infor-
mation and prompt treatment when symptoms are
present.

Although the symptoms of syphilis and gonor-
rhea have been described above, it is impos-
sible to diagnose oneself. Laboratory tests
are necessary. If you have any symptoms or
have reason to believe that you have been ex-
posed to venereal disease, see one of the

"How to Have Intercourse...Without
Getting Screwed" was published by the
ASUW Women's Commission in Seattle, Wash-
ington, in January 1972. The second

Washington. Authors are Lynn K. Hansen,

public health agencies available in this
city, or see your private physician.

Because of the severity of venereal disease
epidemics in some cities and because of its
destructive potential, we react to the very
term "venereal disease" with fear and dis-
taste. And we may associate the disease with
people who are "unclean," "unhealthy," or
"promiscuous." Venereal disease can strike
any sexually active individual. The only
stigma associated with venereal disease falls
on those who allow it to go untreated, there-
by endangering themselves, sexual partners,
and yet-unborn children.

A final note: If you acquire a venereal
disease, be sure to inform your sexual part-
ner so that he or she can obtain treatment.

Infections
VAGINITIS

Vaginitis is any inflammation of the vagina—
inflammation due to irritation, to infection,
or to some process that disturbs normal phy-
siology. Anything which interferes with the
protective mechanism normally present in the
vagina causes vaginitis.

The most common complaints associated with
vaginitis are pain, vaginal discharge, itch-
ing, and burning.

VAGINAL DISCHARGE

Some vaginal discharge is normal. This
normal discharge may increase with the use of
the birth-control pill, especially sequen-
tials, and with emotional stress. However,
vaginal discharge also may be caused by in-
fection or chemical or mechanical irritation.
These are listed below.

Infections that cause vaginal discharge:
gonorrhea, trichomonas, monilia, mycoplasma,
and mixed infections.

Chemical and mechanical irritants that cause
vaginal discharge: douches, if too often or
too strong; feminine hygiene sprays; foams,
vaginal creams, and gels (occasionally);
soaps and bubble baths (sometimes); and
foreign objects, such as lost tampons or
dirty fingers.

As a general rule, to guard against vaginal
irritation, don't put anything in your vagina
that you wouldn't put in your mouth.

TRICHOMONAL VAGINITIS (“TRICH”)

Trichomonas vaginalis is a parasite (proto-
zoa) that is spread by sexual contact. In
males, the organism may live under the fore-
skin, in the urethra, or in the prostate
gland. In women, the organism may be found
in the vagina or the cervix and sometimes in
the urethra or the bladder.

Men often have no symptoms. Women have
itching and usually a discharge that is thin,
yellow-greenish, frothy, and smelly.

Since the infecting organism is transmitted
by sexual contact, both female and male part-
ners must be treated. Treatment is an oral
medication, Flagyl, which is expensive but ef-
fective. Vaginal suppositories also may be
prescribed. Like other sexually transmitted
diseases, prevention depends on infected
people being treated. Men who have been ex-
posed but not treated can protect their part-
ners by using a condom.

MONILA VAGINITIS (CANDIDA, YEAST)

Monilia vaginitis is caused by a yeast-like
organism, candida, that is normally found in
the bowel and on the skin and is commonly
found in the vagina.

Many women harbor candida without symptoms.
Symptomatic yeast infections are common in
pregnancy, in diabetes, in women using the
pill, premenstrually, and sometimes after
diarrhea. In women, the symptoms include
vaginal itching and a discharge, which is us-
ually white, may be thick or thin, and is
sometimes curdy like cottage cheese. It is
usually not smelly. Men will occasionally get
a rash or irritation on the penis.

Treatment with specific antimonilial creams
or suppositories may be prescribed. Sometimes
an at-home use of a vinegar douche (one table-
spoon of vinegar in a pint of lukewarm water
is sufficient). Symptoms often recur, even
after treatment. Continuous good hygiene is
helpful in preventing monilia. Cotton under-
pants that absorb moisture may prevent symp-
toms. However, yeast infections can occur
even when the best rules of hygiene are prac-

* Syphilis may be transmitted congenitally
if the pregnant mother has venereal disease
and is not treated. It also can be trans-
mitted by contact to small children and
babies.

Almost 80 percent of infected females
are asymptomatic carriers; that is, they
are contagious and transmit the disease
but have no symptoms.

While women who carry the infecting or-
ganism, mycoplasma, usually do not have
symptoms, mycoplasma can produce vaginal
discharge in women. This condition is very
difficult to diagnose in women. It must be
diagnosed in the male partner, who then
brings the infected woman for treatment.

PENILE DISCHARGE

Urethral discharge can occur in men. Com-
mon causes of penile discharge are gonorrhea,
occasionally trichomonas, and non-specific
urethritis (NSU).

Nonspecific urethritis occurs primarily in
males. It usually is caused by an organism
called mycoplasma. It is sexually transmit-
ted, often from asymptomatic females. The
symptoms are burning on urination and a dis-
charge that is similar to that of gonorrhea.
Since the organism producing NSU is difficult
to detect in a laboratory test, diagnosis of
NSU is made by ruling out gonorrhea. However,
when it is correctly diagnosed, NSU responds
well to treatment by antibiotics. A seven-
to-ten day treatment is usually successful.

BLADDER INFECTIONS (CYSTITIS)

Cystitis is usually caused by bacteria
found in the lower gastro-intestinal tract
(the rectum), the skin, or the vagina. The
major symptoms are burning sensation during
urination with high frequency and urgency,
and, at times, bloody urine. Cystitis often
occurs in otherwise healthy young women who
recently have become sexually active; hence,
it is sometimes called "honeymoon cystitis."
It may be caused, in part, by the swelling
and irritation of the urethra during inter-
course, with resultant bacterial contamination
of the bladder. If the infection is not
treated with antibiotics, it may progress to
involvement of the kidneys. However, it is
easy to diagnose and responds well to treat-
ment.

Pubic Lice

Pubic lice, also known as "crotch lice" or
"crabs," live in the pubic hair of human be-
ings and feed on blood. They also can survive
in the underarm hair, in the hair around the
nipples, in beards, or in eyebrows. Pubic
lice are transmitted through sexual contact.
Often, the first sign of their presence is
itching in the affected areas. Furthermore,
if you look for them, they are not hard to
see. The eggs (nits) look like small freck-
les. After they have hatched, they can be
recognized as tiny vermin. The nits are
visible as tiny translucent lumps attached to
the base and shaft of the pubic hairs, which
look like pussy willows. After they hatch,
they are mobile. (See drawing.)

Pubic lice are easy to exterminate. Two
applications of gamma benzene hexachloride
(Kwell), which is available by prescription,
should be shampooed into the affected areas.
The preparation begins to work quickly and
will eliminate the lice within a day or two.
Since lice cannot live apart from their human
host, any lice on clothing or linen will die
in twenty-four hours. But to be on the safe
side, you should launder clothing and linen
after treatment has started.

Without Getting Screwed  

Herpes Simplex  

Herpes simplex is a virus which can be  
spread by sexual contact (oral, genital, or  
anal). It is characterized by blisters on  
the skin or mucous membrane. These may itch  
when they are erupting and later become pain-  
ful. The blisters look like and are related  
to cold sores.  

In women the sores occur primarily on the  
labia but also within the vagina. In men  
they can appear on the penis or scrotum. The  
blisters last eight to ten days and do tend  
to recur.  

There are no known cures for herpes simplex.  
However, the discomfort can be reduced through  
Burrows soaks, ice pack, or heat. The sores  
should be encouraged to be dry. Some  
physicians also recommend Glyoxide or Orabase  
(a medication for canker sores), which can be  
purchased at drugstores without a prescrip-  
tion.  

Pap Test  

The Pap test is a laboratory test of a  
sample of cells from the cervix and the upper  
vagina taken during a pelvic examination. This  
test is a valuable diagnostic tool and can  
give early warning of cervical or uterine can-  
cer. Contrary to public opinion, cervical and  
uterine cancer can occur in young women. Can-  
cer is more apt to occur in women who are  
sexually active than in virgins, and it has  
been shown to be associated with having multi-  
ple sex partners, starting at an early age.  
However, cervical and uterine cancer can  
occur in sexually inexperienced women as  
well. All women should have a Pap test once  
a year. If tests for two consecutive years  
show no disorder, however, young women can  
skip two to three years before being retested.  
Tests are given free at many public health  
facilities.

Hall Health Center offers both medical help  
and psychiatric counseling. The staff pro-  
vides counseling on contraception, sexual  
problems, the decision to terminate a preg-

advantage of Hall Health is that its staff  
can treat any physical aspects of your  
problems while giving psychiatric and social  
counseling.  

The Counseling Center in Schmitz Hall  
offers help for problems of an emotional or  
social nature. The Center is not set up to  
provide long-term therapy, and most patients  
will be limited to eight to ten visits, ex-  
cept in rare cases. The types of problems  
with which they deal are fear of homosexuali-  
ty, frigidity, impotence, and adjustment to  
school.  

If these services cannot help you directly,  
they will assist you to locate the free or  
low-cost community agencies that can help.  

OFF CAMPUS  

Several off-campus sources of sexual  
counseling are available in the Seattle area.  
In addition to those that provide general

Americans Still Pursue by Mary Hastings

‘Bliss Machine” and “Perpetual Plastic”

Little Chapel of the Flowers  
"...nestled between a Texaco  
station and the Yucca Motel."  
The typical Las Vegas wedding  
offers a couple (for an addi-  
tional fee) a white rose cor-  
sage, a license with a white  
bow and “artificial greenery and  
flowers" or “perpetual plastic"  
in Las Vegas parlance.

Perhaps we have been wrong.  
We who have taken the institu-  
tion of marriage seriously. We  
who have taken it seriously in a  
number of ways: By fighting it,  
by striving for it, by trying to  
change it.

It has become clear to me  
that those individuals who plac-  
idly accept marriage as a "sine  

qua non", who readily take those  
vows and comfortably break them,  
really have the proper attitude  

toward marriage.

Now comes Marcia Seligson  
and her book, The Eternal Bliss  
Machine, (304 pp., William  
Morrow & Company, Inc., $7.95).  
She confirms my suspicion that  
marriage is, at best, a form  

to be ignored. Seligson's  

book is subtitled, "America's  
Way of Wedding". And the auth-  
or attempts to exhaust the top-  
ic of marriage as did Jessica  
Mitford that of death in The  
American Way of Death. Selig-  
son fails in her attempt.

Do we laugh or cry? At  
this point, I choose to laugh.  
I cannot take marriage seri-  
ously. I was mildly surprised  
when I finished this book to  
find that I could care less  
about marriage or the author's  
revelation--telegraphed early  
in the book--that more Amer-  
icans than ever are marrying.  
My not very nice reaction is:  
Let them.

customs. Under such chapter  
headings as "The Love Machin-  
ery," "The Dream Brokers" and  
"All Decked in White", Selig-  
son shares with us:

Perhaps joining one's life  
with another is more subject-  
ive, thus less readily quanti-  
tated, than is the great ob-  
jectifier, death. And per-  
haps the author's own bias (to  
view matrimony with some amuse-  
ment) precludes a "weighty"  
tone. At any rate, Seligson's  
book emerges as a sometimes  
amusing, usually interesting  
report on the author's person-  
al observations as "member of  
the wedding".

--The spectacle of a young  
bride scaling a step ladder to  
the top of her wedding cake  
and handily wielding a large,  
silver knife to produce the  
first, symbolic (?) slice of  
cake.

Seligson begins with a cul-  
tural anthropologist's view of  
marriage. Although these first  
two chapters are deceptively  
earnest, the author does re-  
veal:  

--The Jewish wedding with  
the ‘flying chuppa' (either a  
symbol of the groom's tent or  
the couple's new home) where  
doves were contained over the  
canopy, released with a flour-  
ish--at the "I do" and all  
floated to the floor--dead."

Sponsors Summer  
Session Rap Groups

The University of Minn-  
esota Women's Center will  
sponsor Summer Session  

rap groups for women stu-  
dents, faculty and comm-  
unity members.

--The first marriage con-  
sisted in a male of one  
tribe raiding another  
tribe, kidnapping a female  
and carrying her off.

--The gold wedding band  

is a symbol of the tether  
around the female's waist  
to facilitate capture.  
(Alas for the vapours  

of Victorian poets and pre-  
1963 songwriters.)

Group meetings will  
start in late June and will  
be held in Health Service  

meeting rooms.

The sessions will be  
staffed by two women from  
the Center and two women  
from the Health Service.  
Groups will form accord-  
ing to participants’ con-  
sciousness. Each group  
will meet about two hours  
per week.

--The primitive male mind  
anchored in endless terrors  
of the unknown, feared wo-  
men perhaps above all else.  
All the aspects of female-  
ness--in their enigmatic  
difference from the male  
structure and function--  
became sources of dread."

date, time and place of

Minds Come Together

— Robin Morgan

by Diana L. Antolik

I want a women’s revolution like a lover

I lust for it, I want so much this freedom
this end to struggle and fear and lies

we all exhale, that I could die just

with the passionate uttering of that desire,

Robin Morgan
Monster

May 30 and other notes; My mind has
been whirling ever since I left the Robin
Morgan Lecture. Lecture is not the word.
The word is some never-ending infinitely
high-pitched scream,

Tonight in a packed auditorium, a
gigantic auditorium, I felt something I
never had before. A super-consciousness of
energies, of emotions, of minds coming to-
gether.

I don't know if it was a lecture. Even
though it was labeled by the University 100-73-
803 The Emergence of Feminist Culture by
Robin Morgan. It seemed like a CR session
with over five hundred people.

Poet in Chem Lab

At seven thirty there was only a small
group of women in the Murphy Hall Auditor-
ium but more and more came. First in small
groups and finally in a flood. Every seat
was taken and there were women sitting two
abreast in the aisles and still more people
coming in. An advocacy for a spirit of love
and sisterhood to put up with the cramped
conditions until something could be worked
out was made. The request was unneeded.
The spirit existed from the start. Finally
the lecture was moved to a Chemistry hall
and there were still people sitting in the
aisles.

Morgan made comment on the setting in
the opening: "There are a number of chapters
in Shulamith's book," (Shulamith Firestone's
The Dialectic of Sex) "in which she talks
about the patriarchal style compartmental-
ization. That is you have art over here and
science over there. It is very apt given
the theme I am trying to talk about under
all that. It's strange but it's apt."

Illness Due to Split

The lecture progressed too swiftly.
Morgan started threading her loom in the beg-
inning in which she was weaving the radical
ideas.

"On the relation of feminist culture and
feminist politics to me the relation between
feminist culture and feminist politics
doesn't exist because feminist culture and
feminist politics are inseparable and in-
deed synonymous.

“The feminist movement is about bridges
between things. At one point there was no
difference between art and science, between
thought and feeling, between intellect and
action. And that profound and deep illness
of our society and not just our society
but the patriarchy globally is due I would
say primarily to that split."

Reactions....

Spending the rest of the night after the
Robin Morgan Lecture awake and writing I
started to wonder around dawn how other women
had reacted during the night hours. So I
started to ask some of the feminists that I
was coming in contact with during the day.
Few of them said that they didn't go and the
reason then was because of work. But those
that did attend were shaken to say the least.

"I sat up and played two or three games
of chess. I hardly ever play chess," was the
reaction of one woman.

"I just sat and thought. Like I was in
a trance," was another woman's reaction.

"Some friends and I sat up most of the
night rapping --- there was so much there,"
was another's statement.

Some of the women could not utter the
thoughts inside of them. Others talked. Some
could not relate to any questions asked by
males they were in contact with. Others
rapped with friends until the grey hours of
the morning.

Through other sources, though (male) I did
find one middle-aged, balding pervert who
explained, "Oh, yeah, Gloria Steinem, naw, it
was Robin Morgan this time, yeah I saw her.
She's the one who talks of castrating men.
Well she's "funny" (I have the feeling that
he meant a Lesbian since there was that
ringing "you-know-what-I-mean-so-I-don't-
have-to-say-the-word" quality in his voice.)

And this whole women’s thing -~- it'll never
make it."

Personal = Political

And later Morgan progressed further
with her point by continuing, "I think one
of the primary places where the reintegration
has begun, and that is another pulse
beat of the feminist movement, is now the
classic phrase 'the personal is political.'

"For women who have been confined to
the ‘personal sphere' the personal is very
political. I could cite ten million
examples as could any woman in this room.
Just a few bases to touch. The housewife
is considered by the establishment a non-
worker. On a quiz show they say, ‘Honey
do you work or are you just a housewife?'
The average housewife works a 99.6 hour work
week."

Not After Equality

And finally after progressing through
many more examples of both the male right
and the male left she brought together the
heart of the thought. "And then there is
the area which I would call radical femin-
ism where there is one priority and that is
women. All women. We are not after equal-
ity with men. The notion makes me want to
throw up. We are not interested in becoming

more like men, or doing what it is men do  
in this culture. But on the contrary  
changing that whole concept as well.  

"We are not after equality or tokenism  
whether it is Margaret Chase Smith or  
Bernadine Dorn. We are, in fact, after  
power... 5"  

"I am not talking about reforming the  
system or revising the system or making the  
patriarchy nice or some kind of wonderful  
humanistic glow. I am talking about a world-  
wide feminist revolution. And in fact a  
gynocracy in which women own all secular and  

Robin Morgan Continued  

I am talking about rage which is right and  
justifiable and firm and beautiful. A right  
to 'man hating' as a class. Because the  
class of men, as oppressors, hurt and the  
class of women, as oppressed, have a right to  
hate where that hurt is coming from. Taking  
one's own feelings seriously enough to go as  
far as they will take one. And you can't do  
that alone because you will think that you  
are going mad in the old way. That is why we  
need each other and that is why we need a  
feminist culture."  

And finally the long poem Monster which  

religious power."  
A Beautiful Madness  

This statement along with the rational  
conclusion that there will most likely be  
some type of bloodshed is one of the long-  

est and most audible screams.  
came to talking about madness.  

Until Morgan  

Morgan has written. One of the women I talked  
to said that during the reading of Monster  

crying.  

"The need for madness in the face of the  

patriarchy is a very valid one.  

I mean  

something very concrete. ...If what in the  
patriarchy is sane I am wooing madness. ...  

she noticed women openly breaking down and  

May we go mad together, my sisters  

May our labor agony in bringing forth this revolution  
Be the death of all pain  

May we comprehend we cannot be stopped
