Weather and the Real Woman

The women of Alexandria,  
Minnesota have come a long  
way.  
A discussion class on the women's  
movement brought local feminists together.  
Alexandria hasn't been the  
same. After the class was  
over, they decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-raising group.

Trap Door and T.V.

One of the women is Wendy  
Wallace. On weekdays, she  
pulls open a trap door in a  
building downtown and descends to a shop called "The  
Trap Door" where she and her  
mother sell carved gourds,  
silver rings, wicker baskets,  
wooden boxes, and other gifts.

On weekends, Wendy enters  
another door, that of the  
KCMT-TV station in Alexandria,  
and does the weekend weather.

Wendy has a long history  
of television work. When she  
was 15, she read the weather  
on TV in Fargo. Later, she  
did Unguentine and All-State  
Insurance commercials in California.

Women’s Work

She met little resistance  
when she applied for the job  
at KCMT; the job had already  
been pegged as "women's work"  
--the former weatherperson  
was a woman. Now, she says,  
if one of the talent is absent  
during the week, she substitutes in the weather slot,  
but never in any other. If  
the anchorman is gone, she  
will replace the weatherman,  
who replaces the sports announcer, who replaces the  
anchorman...

Unsatisfied with these conditions, she conceived a plan  
for another show, a show on  
women, and approached the  
station director with her  
idea. “I was shocked when he  
approved it," she said, and  
since February, Wendy has  
been hosting a 15-minute show  
called "What's New with Women"  
on Sundays at 12:15 pm.  
She has reported on such topics as welfare, divorce, and  
abortion, and has interviewed  
Carol Jetland, of the Minnesota  
Education Association Committee on Women.

Last fall an adult education  
class on the women's movement  
brought local feminists together,  
and since then Wendy's radicalization seems  
to have been prophesied in  
the name she and her husband  
Patrick gave to their 19-month-old daughter, Erin  
Pendrick. "Pendrick is a  
phonetic combination of our  
names...We took the 'end'  
from 'Wendy' and the 'Prick' from 'Patrick.'"

Viewers and Colleagues

Viewer response has been  
disappointing. No one has  
written with comments on the  
issues she has presented.  
Several people have admired  
her hair. A couple of men  
have written her that they  
have fallen in love with her.  
Once, in a spirit of irony, a  
woman sent a poem (reprinted  
below) about motherhood "from  
her collection." Wendy said,  
"I read it as straight as I  
could and wanted a copy of the  
poem."

What is a mother?

A mother is soft hands and a  
warm heart.

A mother has lots of tears,  
She never runs out of them.

A mother is different.  
She never takes the last chop  
on the plate.

She likes chicken backs and  
necks.  
Dad and the kids don't.

When a mother dies, she goes  
to heaven.  
The coveted job of all:  
Sitting on soft, white,  
fluffy clouds  
Holding the angelic babies  
And wiping away their celestial tears  
With the corner of her apron.

Wendy feels she is not taken  
seriously by the men at  
the TV station and says she  
is not treated as a regular  
part of the staff. She is  
never invited to office parties  
or get-togethers, and is  
not treated with friendliness  
"as though it would not be  
proper." But, she says, "any  
time I pull a goof they all  
love me." Wendy says she  
"detests dresses," but one  
week when she substituted on  
another show, her clothes  
were supplied by a local  
dress shop. One day she wore  
a light blue dress complete  
with ruffles and lace. She  
wore her hair in pigtails.  
She says she felt like a 5-year-old  
on her way to a birthday party.  
When she arrived at the station, one  
of the men said, "Now you  
look like a real woman."

Three people wrote in.  
And there she gets the most.
