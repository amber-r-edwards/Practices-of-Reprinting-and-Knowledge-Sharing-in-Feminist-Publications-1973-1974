about us  
We felt some explanation of why we haven't published an issue since  
August was due. One reason is childcare which was work done by mo-  
thers and a few childless women with very little help from the rest  
of us. But after the last issue some women confronted the rest of  
the women's community about not doing enough in childcare and since  
then we have been busy beginning to share that work, helping at a  
new daycare center in town, doing outside childcare, & meeting with  
the non-biological mothers groups we formed to help deal with the  
fears and inadequacies that some of us felt about childcare. We have  
also been in an upheaval within the AIAW collective. In fall we had  
decided that our collective needed to be a tight one - a primary  
collective for all of us and that that would solve the internal mis-  
trust that was coming between us. Well, the process of tightening  
up the collective (dealing with how we all felt about the group,  
how we felt about working together) caused so much trauma, that we  
were forced to reconsider whether at this period in the community  
a tight closed collective was what we needed. There are a lot of  
women in the community that we trust and feel close to politically  
and personally, & although there are times when isolating yourselves  
is advantageous, our interests currently are much more wrapped up in  
the women's community here. We share the same struggles as other  
women in town. We finally reversed directions; calling a meeting of  
women in the community we felt we could work with to talk about po-  
litical directions, about what political work we each wanted to be  
doing, to ask for suggestions about the paper & talk about the idea  
for this issue. Since the last issue & that meeting several new  
groups have formed. There are various groups now revolving around  
the daycare center, a group of women printing an anthology of the two  
women's poetry readings that were held here, & a group planning to  
start a women's press. The membership of these groups overlaps a  
lot - overcommitment is something we can't seem to solve. There  
is so much we want to do. The AIAW collective has had some changes  
in membership during this time but still remains pretty small. We  
all feel that the paper is a good thing because it's the one thing  
we do that communicates with women who we don't know or work with.  
But it is difficult to find new women who we could work with who  
want to join a collective that is 2 yrs. old. The idea of a women's  
press is new and exciting & the paper is feeling its age. But most  
of us want it to continue & to somehow serve as a chronicle of the  
struggles of our community here - to somehow have them recorded, ex-  
plained, & analyzed. That's why this issue seems important since the  
struggle over childcare has touched almost everyone in the women's  
community. —

about this issue  
All of our time seemed to be consumed with childcare - doing it,  
worrying about doing it, worrying about not doing it, fighting over  
it & the meetings to decide what to do about the paper, what to  
publish, who to work with, seemed distant. Mothers and a few non-  
mothers had been doing an astounding amount of work on daycare for  
yrs. & lots of other women in the community were finally getting in-  
volved with childcare too, hassling about it, doing it, or not do-  
ing it & feeling guilty, or always doing it & feeling angry. It  
seemed so logical that what we published should reflect what was  
going on in the women’s community in Iowa City & much of what was/  
is going on here revolves around childcare. & everyone has something  
to say. If you put up a sign at the daycare center about anything,  
several scribbled answers, a graffiti dialogue, will appear in a  
couple days' time. Those of us working on the paper couldn't possi-  
bly present the whole issue of childcare as it concerns this com-  
munity. Except for two of us, we have just recently got our shit  
together & started working at it. None of us are mothers. We hung  
up announcements of this issue asking all the women in the commun-  
ity to write something & decided anything submitted would be print-  
ed. We kept copies of all articles handed in in a notebook at the  
daycare center so everyone could read them. A lot of the copy in this  
issue is a result of women responding to articles other women wrote.  
We think all the articles together present a pretty good picture of  
the issue of childcare as struggled over in the women's community  
in Iowa City & that's what we wanted to do. Our hope is that people  
will read the entire paper in sequence because it is the entirety of  
the issue that tells the story. What is and has happened here as re-  
gards childcare we think is useful to other women in other communi-  
ties but in some ways our struggles may be different. This community  
is small and on a whole pretty privileged, which does not make the  
lives of poor or working-class women here much easier. But being in  
a privileged university community does make some things more possi-  
ble. The university (great white father/employer/landlord/& master  
of us all) rents out huge bourgeois houses for $75 a month because of  
the pressure put on them & hard work done by women over a year ago,  
women in the community contribute financially to support the center  
because so many can afford to do so, & only two weeks after it start-  
ed it was full of toys, furniture, etc. It's true that some of that  
stuff was acquired from Goodwill dumpsters but even the dumpsters  
here are surrounded by goodies to snatch that you don't see around  
the dumpsters in Chicago or Boston. It was hard work to start the  
new daycare center but it was possible here. Low-income women and/or  
women in large cities may encounter struggles we glided through or  
avoided. Most women can't get beyond fighting for the physical fa-  
cility in which to start a center. But we think our experiences could  
be helpful & perhaps because our community crosses class lines and  
involves gay & straight women, a spectrum of community thought pre-  
sents a fairly accurate analysis of an issue that is real important  
in one way or another to all of us."

manifesto  

Mystification of Motherhood  

Motherhood is a mystique. It fails to separate the biological  
function of delivering a child from the social function of care  
and socialization. The sexual double standard reappears in child  
care: men threatened with the responsibility simply leave the  
scene - sometimes physically, sometimes mentally. The woman is  
left with the burden. Abandonment of children by women is seen  
as an unnatural, monstrous act. Men abandon children regularly  
without comparable social disapproval. After birth a child takes  
on a life of its own. Every function necessary for its survival  
and growth can be performed by any competent adult.  

On Her Own  

Those who assume the motherhood role are systematically excluded  
from employment and participation in any organization or institu-  
tion outside the home. These organizations, precisely because  
mothers are an insignificant portion of their membership, are un-  
aware of (or can ignore) the problems of child care. Thus, the  
exclusion of mothers is self-perpetuating.  

How are women with children kept outside the mainstream of society?  
Children need constant care. When the woman wants to do something  
else, a substitute must be found. Lack of free, 24-hour child  

care centers bind women to their children. This lack of facilities  
is most serious for women who care for very young children, or  

who cannot afford a babysitter, or who live alone. Even in co-op  
day care centers, where theoretically there exists an awareness of  
the need for child care to liberate women, membership has argued  
for the exclusion of families with diaper-aged children. Take-  
home pay for most jobs open to women, already low to begin with,  

is decimated by babysitting fees. Even when other adults are in  
the household, they seldom provide reliable relief.  

Another and more subtle way women are excluded is through sched-  
uling of activities. NUC, for example, (this organization is only  
typical...most follow the same pattern) arranged as many as four  
meetings a month at 2-tavern between five and seven on Friday  
evenings. Not only was no child care provided, but the time in-  
terfered with such routine tasks as providing meals. Those who  
can afford them argue for babysitters: one day care co-op scheduled  
six parent meetings with no provision for child care. With baby-  
sitting, both parents could attend; without it, only one. Obvious-  
ly those who hired babysitters acquired more control.  

This is a common syndrome which eventually restricts membership  
and control to childless, moneyed, and male people.  

Yet even when child care is made available for meetings, this is  
only a minimal attempt to rectify the problem. What of meetings  
and events scheduled late, or which run to late hours? The child-  
less membership does not get up with the children.  

Mothers can never participate fully when commitment requires  
energy beyond meeting attendance. ALL major time commitments  
exacerbate housekeeping and mothering tasks. When the woman has  

a job outside the home (dealing with welfare is a job) the problem  
is compounded.  

Finally, guilt paralyzes most women once they take a step away  
from home. Children cry, dishes collect, and she wonders if she  
is doing the right thing. If no one is there to say yes and give  
support, she will decide No on her own.

Nuclear Family I  

What keeps women tied to their biological children? The nuclear  
family. As long as it is the dominant social and economic unit,  
women will remain enslaved to the motherhood role. At present  
each female is personally responsible for the consequences of her  
biology. Each must negotiate the situation of pregnancy with a  
single male (father, lover, husband,) or a male institution (adop-  
tion agencies, welfare.)  

Pregnant women, if not fired outright, are discouraged from work-  
ing. Teachers in Iowa are retired at their fifth month. Then  
they are rehired (at one-third pay) as substitute teachers until  
delivery. Welfare women must often work for unscrupulous people  
at below minimum wage. The pay loss is compensation to the em-  
ployer for the ""favor"" he does her of not reporting the wages to  
the welfare department. The effect of such treatment is to drive  
women to be dependent on the greater economic security of males.  
She stays home while he goes out to earn. He is rewarded for  
working with money, and gains power and prestige. She engages in  
unpaid labor - averaging 99.6 hours per week.  

This workload is more than double that of the male.  
Nuclear Family II  

The woman left in her house with her children has no power to ne-  
gotiate the terms of her 99.6 hour job with other adults. Her  
singular responsibility for children leaves her in a position  
where she can be counted on to work when others prefer not to.  

The welfare of the children urges her to participate in this ar-  
rangement, though it is physically and emotionally damaging. The  
situation is not better in most collective living arrangements,  
where supposedly the child care is shared. The attitude remains  
that the mother has ultimate ""say"" and responsibility, with no op-  
tion to neglect ""her"" duties.  

Society provides one major alternative to marriage for economic  
security: remarriage. Even following the rules of the situation,  
this is difficult. Thus, alimony and ADC, pittance that they are,  
hold the survival line for families not headed by a male. Until  
all women have employment at decent pay, the begging, pleading,  
and threatening for this survival money will remain and grow as  

an economic institution.  

Economics  

Exclusionary practices result in loss of basic learned and social  
skills - consequently women lose the ability to earn an adequate  
salary. Projecting personal rather than social responsibility  
for children maintains the oppression of ALL women. All are  
treated as potential mothers who must be supported by men. This  
circumstance is an excuse to keep women out of career-producing  
areas of education, to employ them marginally, and to pay them  
minimally. Until economic realities are dealt with, demands of  
women will be met only under conditions prone to co-optation.  
Paid maternity leaves, 24-hour child care, salary supplements  
for child care, paid time off to work in day care co-ops: these  
demands fall in this category.  

Continual dependence on others results in loss of control over  
one's own life; little opportunity for growth; and a sense of fu-  
tility and valuelessness in activities. Gay mothers cannot and  
do not rely on men but on other women for support, when possible.  
Often gay mothers are forced to rely on welfare, and must ""pass”  
as straight.  

Even experience with and ability to care for children is consid-  
ered of little value. Pediatricians, specially trained teachers,  
child psychologists - all who generally have little experience  
outside a specialized area, are looked to as authorities on the  
subject.  

Nuclear family as economic  
and social unit  
+ Economic power invested  

in men  

= Women personally re-  
sponsible for children  

Who Owns Children?  

The nuclear family as the basic economic unit is the precondition  
for the belief that children belong exclusively to the family,  
that is, the property of the male and the responsibility of the  
female. In divorce cases, the child becomes the property of the  
state and is given over to the custody of the mother. As male  
property, both female and child take his name.  

Women are encouraged to measure their success in life through  
their responsibility for children. It is no accident many of  

them try to live vicariously through their children (or through  
the more powerful husband.) But if mothers fail in child rearing,  
the community also fails. It is the community, not the individual  
women, who reaps the benefits of a successfully “raised"" child.  
Societies need children to carry on culture and work. The male  
social order needs the fruits of, but does not want to tend, the —  
growth of children. Women are persuaded and coerced into the job.

While it is true that relating to children has its moments of  
ecstasy, it also has moments of hell. Mothers need support and  
aid from the community—especially from childless members of  
that community.  

Excuses  

Often childless adults will refuse to associate with children.  
""I just don't like being around them."" ""Sorry, I don't like  
children."" They may as well say they don't like peaches or  
prunes. This attitude relegates children to the status of ob-  
jects that can be taken or left. By comparison, such statements  
as yet fail to evoke emotional reactions, as would ""I don't like  
Blacks."" Children, however, ARE people in the same sense as any  
adult category.  

Like adults, children need warming up to. When a person has been  
dependent on another for a long time, as is generally the case  
with children, they are threatened by advances from new people.  
This situation must be struggled with among child, new person,  
and whoever was the focus of the child's dependency.  

Others realize, dimly or clearly, that child care is a drag.  
They simply don't want to give.  

""I'm no good at it.""  

""I'm so busy!""  

""I have more important things to do.""  

""I don't want to hear about it.""  

The underlying assumption here is that women choose to have child-  
ren and should want to take care of them.  

A Choice  

The ""choice"" attitude is based on consciousness of what child  
care involves. Many assume that because THEY at this time, know  
what child care involves, so did all the mothers, years ago, when  
they conceived. Therefore, they feel absolved from responsibility.  
Actually, it is largely a matter of chance which particular women  
conceive. Consciousness comes with changing social circumstances  
and experience. Biological ability to become pregnant usually pre-  
dates having much consciousness of any kind.  

Further, the attitude that women choose is both anti-feminist and  
class-biased. The ""choice"" depends on:  

- availability of general health and birth control information.  
- total effectiveness of birth control.  
- money for and access to abortions.  
- ability to project divorce, separation, and death.  
- time for and probability of contact with others conscious of  
  what child care involves.  
- support to withstand social pressure to conform to the mother-  
  hood role.  

All these factors decrease with class status.  

Problems of Daycare Co-ops  
How They Oppress Women  

Even in the most progressive of parent-controlled (none are yet con-  
trolled in any significant way by non-parents) day care co-ops,  
individual women definitely bear the consequences of their bio-  
logy. Volunteers, especially male volunteers, are hard to find  
and harder to keep. In families with two parents, women most  
often fill work requirements.  

Although child care is for women and children, decisions are not  
made by women. At general membership meetings, some women say  
nothing. At women's daycare meetings, these same women say plenty.  

Day care co-ops are white, middle-class, university affiliated.  
There are no child care centers for third-world, lower-class, or  
non-university women and children.  

Co-op membership has been reluctant to deal with issues of class-  
ism, racism, sexism, homosexism, and ageism. Consciousness  
raising, with its probing into personal values and activities,  
has been firmly resisted.  

The parent(s)-child unit remains the principal sub-unit of the  
co-ops. Childless persons are in a position of having to justify  
their actions to parents. Little is done to re-socialize child-  
ren. An illusion of dealing with sex roles is maintained by  
treating the children ""equally."" This means encouraging them to  
be passive. Once in school, boys will be expected to grow away  
from passivity, and girls will be reinforced in it. Re-socializa-  
tion of children cannot begin until adults deal thoroughly with  
their own socialization. This is a long way off.  

Women's Movement  

Child care is not yet considered a responsibility of the larger  
feminist community (gay and straight). Children who don't attend  
day care co-ops are left pretty much with their mothers. Day care  
was initiated as an important part of the women's movement, yet it  
is now virtually ignored by most non-mother feminists. Gay and  
straight women are both guilty. Many gay women have consciously  
made a choice not to have children as a part of their choice not  
to relate to men. This should not excuse them from child care  
responsibilities involving women. If any woman is not sharing  
child care, she contradicts herself as a feminist.  

The isolating quality of child care erodes a mother's ability to  
deal with other adults effectively. Losing self-confidence and  
speaking ability, she is easily intimidated by those with more  
practice.  

Women coming to the movement from a housewife/mother situation  
need encouragement as well as child care. Too often political  
women react with disgust at unsophisticated viewpoints. It is  
rare that any group of women considers child care for its member-  
ship an important initial concern.  

Child care problems must be dealt with by women at this point.  
This is not, however, the total solution. At such time when men  
deal with themselves and change (and as they do) child care will be  
their responsibility as well.  

Oppose Federally Sponsored Daycare  

Government sponsored and subsidized day care (as opposed to 24  
hour women and children controlled child care) maintains and in-  
creases exploitation. Females are ""liberated"" to work a low-  
paying job, but resume the mommy role once the job ends. The  
Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of the Nixon administration is such  
a carga work relief. Women using these centers are doubly bur-  
dened.  

Federally sponsored day care (already typified by Project Head  
Start) encourages the belief that biological mothers are respon-  
sible for biological children.  

Mandates  

A. Political priorities must include that 24 hour child care  
facilities be provided on a widespread basis, free of all cost,  
to women, particularly to women not yet served. (Non-white,  
lower/working-class, non-university.) All aspects of child care  
situations must be controlled by women and children.  

B. Collective living situations must be organized as a counter-  
institution to the nuclear family. Every adult must share equal  
responsibility for child care and housekeeping REGARDLESS OF COMMIT-  
MENT TO OTHER—INCLUDING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC—ACTIVITIES.  

A part of every living situation should be discussion by all lead-  
ing to consensual agreement on how the children are to be socialized.  
To fight the children-as-property attitude, and encourage viewing  
children as people, collective child care should integrate physical,  
social, and political welfare.  

Toward these goals we must engage in the following:  

1. CONSCIOUSNESS is a prerequisite to taking direct action. All  
CR groups must include mothers and must provide child care. Meet-  
ings must be scheduled at times convenient for mothers. Groups  
should not be sedentary but lead to a program of action. Every  
group member must learn practical aspects of child care and find  
a situation to apply what she learns. This means taking care of  
children on a STRUCTURED, reliable basis in a communal living  
arrangement, in a child care center, or in the home of a woman  
who needs more help.  

2. CR groups must work toward community programs which transcend  
and incorporate problems of individual women.  

- 24-hour centers  
- collective living arrangements  
- paid time off for child care  
- further formulating and disseminating an analysis of the child  
  care struggle  

""Childless"" persons already involved should do their own CR and  
take an aggressive role in this, especially in taking power and  
responsibility away from biological parents. Men have equal say,  
which is hardly equitable, since they have different interests from  
women and children.  

G Woman ? feb. '73 Z."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page004.txt,AintIAWoman,,4,"what I wrote for this issue on daycare from

what I can remember about how

I saw it

In the spring of 1970, the Women's Liberation Front in Iowa City
split into small cells along interest/project lines. At that time
I saw the daycare cell as one of many projects people could choose
to do but not as something that everyone should be doing. I chose
to work in the publications collective and the publishing of Ain't
I A Woman? became my priority. I sort of understood -- but not
really -- that when we split into project groups that some of the
women who chose daycare did so out of political necessity since
they had children and needed daycare. Who knows what their choice
would have been had daycare been available to them. Had I had
children of my own I too would have been in the daycare cell --
probably never allowing myself to think about whether I wanted to
work on a paper.

I did start working one morning a week at Dum Dum, the first
daycare center that the WL daycare cell organized and opened. It
was a good experience for me learning that I did in fact like kids,
that none of the kids died while I was working, that I could learn
to change a diaper. I had never been around kids before and cer-
tainly didn't completely overcome my fears, but it was a beginning.

It was just around that time that I had broken up with my hus-
band and admitted to myself that I was gay. My hatred and resent-
ment toward men was still sizzling and I found working with men
(who were recruited to volunteer at the center) hard and often of-
fensive. I saw no reason at that time (and still don't) to struggle
with men in most instances, but I understand now how women who have
children to take care of don't see that option (to not relate or
struggle with men) as a viable one even if they'd like to. In a
sense the men seemed to have incredible power in the situation
since the women needed their help and were willing to give them
equal control and struggle with them to get it. Most of the women
involved were heterosexual and had no intention of cutting men out
of their lives, but even the few women who did have that intention
didn't think women could do it themselves -- could or would take
care of each other including each other's children. At that time
I saw that as straight male-identified thinking and lack of trust
in other women. Now I think I understand better why women with
children didn't trust those of us who had no children -- who had
other political priorities, who at the most did a half day of day-
care a week and had the option not to do any.

Still there were many disagreements I had with the women who
worked in daycare. Mostly they were over separatism and over the
fact that even the women who were separatists working in daycare
did not support me and other women who were separatist or gay, and
pandered to the men and women who used the center. They believed
in community control and it seemed like any sacrifice in politics
was acceptable to that end. I don't see any way to simply describe
what I mean by community control. In this case the center was run
by general meetings of parents and volunteers. I also can't spell
out exactly how I think it should have been run. There is no op-
posite to community control, really. My complaint about it is that
there are so many contradictions between volunteers and parents
and that the way those contradictions generally get worked out is
by majority rule rather than consensus (which I think is more
right). Also even though I think people using a service and people
working there should control it, I don't think that means they have
the right to oppress anyone. Like an all-white community doesn't
have the right to be racist under the guise of community control--
like parents don't have the right to be homosexist under the guise
of community control of a daycare center.

It was during that first summer that the center was opened that
the women in daycare and the women putting out the paper clashed.
The daycare center wanted to put out some recruiting literature
to hand out at registration here at the university. AIAW offered
to give them the centerfold of the paper which could be removed
from the paper and we offered to cover the cost. However, we wouldn't
change any of our policies -- one of which was no males writ-
ing in the paper. The daycare women wanted to include reactions
from male volunteers and thought our policy was wrong. From then
on the disagreements between the paper and daycare only got worse.

In thinking back to that time I still feel my disagreements with
the daycare cell were political and valid. At that time a feminist
community was just beginning to grow and the women building it by
attempting to live independently with other women, to not relate
to men, should have been given respect and support. There never
seemed a valid reason to reject our complaints about daycare while
making concessions to male volunteers. And the arguments from the
daycare cell about the need of the parents I could never see since
the center was pretty freaky and university oriented. It all seemed
pretty middle-class to me. Mostly the disagreements we had kept me
from ever seeing the other (perhaps real) issue of daycare which
was that those of us who did not have children of our own had a re-
sponsibility to share the work involved in taking care of children.
We talked about a feminist controlled center at that time but never
did anything about it. I stopped working at the center completely
by mid-winter and pretty much didn't relate to any women who
worked in daycare except two women who lived in my living collec-
tive. One of those women later moved in with a woman, her husband

page Vol. 3

and three kids. I never could completely understand how she could
stand living in such a heterosexual scene but I do understand now
how much help she gave in taking care of the children. I know I
could never do anything like that and though I better understand now
how much help a biological mother needs and how I have a responsi-
bility to share the work involved, I still don't feel that it is
fair to expect a gay woman to live in a heterosexual environment
to fulfill that responsibility. But then I no longer think it's
fair that any biological mother be left alone with the responsibi-
lity for her children either. At that time as I said I didn't re-
late to any biological mothers, children, or even women working in
daycare. I think there are all kinds of walls and dividers blocking
single (especially gay) women from relating to children. For a
while this didn't bother me much at all and I still didn't feel I
had a responsibility to do daycare in addition to my other politi-
cal priorities. But eventually I started feeling that I wanted to
relate to children but relating to them always seemed to mean being
with men or heterosexual couples.

Somehow this changed somewhat. Maybe it was due to more women
becoming gay and more women becoming part of or relating to the
women's community here -- some of whom had children of their own
and some of whom had been doing childcare for some time. Through
these women and through my friend who was living with three child-
ren, I started being around children more and in situations where
I felt I could be myself and be honest with them -- instead of be-
ing uptight about my politics or gayness slipping out in front of
parents or men.

Just this summer a small group of parents and volunteers (mostly
gay) split from one of the daycare centers in town over its sex-
ism and homosexism. They began planning a feminist controlled day-
care center. When I was called about it, I was surprised at how ex-
cited I was. And I must have changed some by that time in terms of
my consciousness of the daycare issue because even though I still
wanted to have a political group or project that was my priority
and I was pretty sure that I didn't want that to be daycare, I was
willing and thought it right that daycare time be demanded of me.
The center was started in temporary housing to provide daycare for
the children that had been left without it after the split and was
still very much in the planning stages when I left town for two
weeks. When I came back the concept of the center had changed. It
was now a center to serve low-income and working-class women. That
really disappointed me a lot. Why it disappointed me is a whole
other article but real simplistically: 1) being working class my-
self I felt that since most of the women involved in starting it
were middle class that it was presumptuous at best to think they
could supply a service to low-income and working-class mothers that
would not be exploitative and 2) I was afraid of the sacrifices
that would be made regarding feminism -- there was talk at that
time of gay women having to shuffle at the new center. However since
the center was still to have only women working there, I intended
to be active. I also saw the center as involving many women in the
women's community and being a good way to struggle over the issue
of daycare."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page005.txt,AintIAWoman,,5,"Also when I came back to town the women who had been most in-
volved with the center were angry as all hell and ready to kick ass
over the fact that many women did not do enough daycare and/or were
irresponsible about the daycare that they did do or said they'd do. The
real gut of the issue I think, where the anger came from, was the
anger of women who were responsible for children (in most cases
their own) toward those of us who had the option of doing daycare
or not -- who had not been much of any help in the past and who at
the most had a pretty superficial understanding of childcare.

The first general meeting that was called of all volunteers and
women who wanted to work in the center was almost totally consumed
with putting all of us who are not mothers and who hadn't done much
daycare up against the wall. The meeting began with two women leav-
ing to go get another woman who hadn't shown up and eventually
physically fighting with her, and from there on the meeting only
got worse with the issues of daycare, class, violence versus non-
violence, getting thrown around in confusing and sometimes really
incorrect ways.

It wasn't the first time I really disagreed with what was com-
ing down over daycare and it wasn't the first time I felt really
offended by some of what mothers were saying in regard to gayness
and class. People were so angry over other people's laxness on day-
care and so self-righteous about it that much was thrown out that
I found offensive to gay women and particularly to working class
women. It was really hard for me to listen to middle class women
(who had children) tell me (working class) about the needs of work-
ing class mothers since I felt there was a lot of classist stereo-
typing expressed in their ideas. It was also hard to listen to
middle class women talk to me about how privileged I was because
I didn't have children.

The women who were planning the center issued financial state-
ments to be filled out and used as a basis for taxing the volun-
teers and thus financially supporting the center. I found that
pretty threatening since there was an atmosphere of classifying

women without children as privileged in regard to childcare with-
out being sensitive to their class backgrounds or other oppressions
they may have suffered. In the same way, mothers were labeled op-
pressed seemingly without regard to their class positions. However
it was the first time I knew I could not correctly choose to not
deal with daycare because I disagreed with the politics of the
women involved. Despite how incorrect in some ways I think the
anger was directed and used, it was that anger and being put up
against the wall that forced me to deal with an issue I had ignored

for so long.

The daycare issue in this town has always been complex, but in
the past when contradictions developed between people, the child-
less women would split. I think our political consciousness has
grown higher now and does not allow us that option. Doing child-
care is now respected political work that is expected of women
active in the women's community. There is social pressure put on
women who refuse to do childcare and this, I think, is as it should
be. The complexities of the issue have increased by the number of
women who have to deal with it and the contradictions between gay
women and straight women, mothers and non-mothers, women of dif-
ferent classes.

I don't see any easy direction -- I know I'm not sure of what
is the absolute way of dealing with it. Right now there are hassles
between the needs of mothers and the needs of gay women who work
in the center. The only way I know to deal with that is to deal
with it -- not ignore it and for all of us to be sensitive to
everyone's needs and oppressions. As regards childcare I think
mothers must be listened to because it is they who best understand
the issue and work involved. I realize that what I say could
sound like wishy-washy liberalism -- everybody should be listened
to, etc. But I think we have long passed the stage of seeing things
in simplistic contradictions and as regards contradictions between
women (lesbian/straight, working class/middle class, etc.) I don't see
that any contradiction is primary or any oppression is primary.

I am only sure that no oppression should be ignored.

~.d million memories.
that make me sick...

When I was eleven I started babysitting.
I enjoyed it and children liked me; often
they would come and ask me to ""babysit
them"" without their parents’ knowledge. I
was tall, skinny, and not very articulate
(my mother was beautiful and intelligent
and never could understand how she'd gotten
this dumb and ugly daughter) but child-
ren didn't seem to mind, and I didn't care
that they were little and not very articu-
late.

By 18 I had filled out enough to fit the
emaciated vogue and my mother, being a
realist, often told me I'd better get
married before I lost my figure and couldn't
find a husband. I was just 19 when I
followed that advice to her relief.

In the next eight years my husband some-
how taught me that my whole worth was in
my body which began to betray me with age
and pregnancies. I remember wanting my
first child, but I also remember crying
and freaking out, wanting to leave my hus-
band, wanting to stay pregnant and not
have the baby, wanting not to be pregnant,
angry screaming sessions when I would
threaten to leave knowing that I had no-
where to go, no way to get there, and no
money that was not his. Money was what
kept me with him, and guilt, and a feeling
that I was a rotten person and all these
feelings were evil, and anyway I was cer-
tainly not capable of taking care of my-
self. I used to wish he would die and
fantasize about how I should react when
they came and told me.

For years I stayed up until two and
three a.m. then crept quietly into bed
trying not to squeak the springs so he
wouldn't wake up, and when he did lying
quietly, responding as little as possible,
trying to keep my mind on other things,
feeling inadequate and not wanting him to
know. At first it did hurt to have sex; after
the children it was mostly just degrading
and a time-consuming bore which kept me
from getting enough sleep. I was always
tired.

Our second child was an unfortunate
mistake. By this time I knew enough to be
terrified of giving birth, and of having
the responsibility of children; and my
husband was in Viet Nam doing his macho
adventurer, and at that time glorified,
thing; so I was alone with this one.

Smiling male lab technicians gave me the
good news that I was indeed five months

pregnant and were shocked when I started
crying and couldn't stop (after all I was
married!). I felt like a selfish sub-hu-
man. I cried every night for months and

it was my first child who often climbed
into bed with me patting my back saying
“don't cry mommy."" I felt guilty for that
too. That child was my only reason for
surviving. We, together, dealt with what
was happening without words, without ex-
planations -- with hugs and smiles and rag-
ing screaming tantrums. I began to deny the
pregnancy and in that way with the support
of a two-year-old I coped. But when the
undeniable happened and the new baby came

I didn't love her, I didn't even like her,
I didn't want her. And now a new problem
set in. You can't go anywhere with a tod-
dler, an infant, two diaper bags and a
purse. About once a week my mother babysat
(more often if I begged) and I had enough
money for a babysitter once in a while,
other than that I took out the garbage and
talked to the mailman. Three months later
my husband arrived home, in a wheelchair,
having been seriously injured in Viet Nam.
So now I had to push him around and wait
on him as well as always be cheerful so as
not to make him feel depressed. The only
thing he could do was have sex. The first month
he was out of the hospital I had to bundle
up the children and drive him to the hospi-
tal for shots every six hours.

I began to go through depressions that
lasted for months, only getting drunk
helped, which I did as often as possible. I
thought constantly of death, the look he'd
have when he found me, what others would
feel -- bad, I hoped. I began to resent,
hate the children. My daughter was into
smearing the walls of her room with shit
once or twice a day, she screamed, fussed,
cried, or was into something all the time
and was generally unpleasant to be around.
My best escape was sleep, but with the
children I couldn't sleep in the daytime,
and at night there was my husband to con-
tend with. I didn't even think about leav-
ing at first; all that talk about broken
homes and juvenile delinquents and how
could I support two children and what I
owed everybody else, especially the child-
ren and my duty and responsibility, somehow
I was stuck forever and it was their fault.
I had no friends; married women seldom do,
their husbands carefully see to that. I had
only him to talk to and over the years I

had learned that he was always right in the
end until I could barely formulate an opin-
ion much less make a decision; to say what
I thought was to have it changed into some-
thing else until I only thought his thoughts
(that still happens, after all those years
it’s hard to change). It took me three
months to decide to leave, then it was six
more months before I left, six months of

me begging for money and him being cool and
logical and reasonable, telling me how I
couldn't manage and me explaining that it
wasn't him but me, that I was all messed up
and needed a little time away to get it to-
gether, then I'd surely be back if he'd
only be patient. He let me go out of fear

I think, fear that I would kill myself or
go insane. I had the nerve to leave because
of that same fear.

The next two years were almost as bad as
before with me hoping for an empty mail
box rather than the guilt of letters from
him and well-meaning friends and family al-
ways telling me why I should return (""think
of the children""), him being sick from his
Viet Nam injuries, he was going to die he
kept saying, he was only asking for two
years of my life, it was the least I could
do. And there were the other men each worse
than the last. In the end I felt like a
headless body (""shut up and get in bed"").

I was lucky, I was only forcibly raped
once.

It goes on and on, a million memories
that make me feel sick, screaming at the
children until my head ached then panicked
with guilt; having sex with man after man
that I disliked, it was enough if they
would talk to me and would put up with the
children; trying to teach the kids to be
polite and quiet and not scare people away.

But I don't like people touching me now.
And I have little patience with children.
I'm terrified of the gay women's community
because there seems to be no place to go
if I can't be there. But women start tell-
ing each other what mothers would want as
though I don't exist, or talking and tell-
ing me I'm wrong about everything I think
or feel and it doesn't matter if I'm right
or wrong and I'm probably wrong, but I'm
starting to understand where I've been and
what it's done to me. I don't think you
realize that you can't erase those years
simply by doing childcare now. That being
a mother like every other form of oppres-
sion, goes deeper than the physical reality."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page006.txt,AintIAWoman,,6,"DIALOG BETWEEN OLD GAYS

I never wanted a child, or wanted anything to do with children.  
After doing babysitting in my early teens I had nothing more to do  
with children until this last year. I've gone through really rad-  
ical changes in my attitude about children: from being threatened  
about how little control I have with their candidness to being less  
authoritarian and giving them more control over activities, trying  
to be non-age chauvinistic, from feeling they are helpless, puzzl-  
ing and fragile to encouraging them to be independent, self-suffi-  
cient and tough, listening to their ideas and respecting children.

I shared the attitude held by many lesbians who have been gay  
for years--why should I do any childcare? Children come from  
heterosexual relationships that not only oppress me, but socially  
ostracize me when the opportunity comes up. Children cannot be  
entrusted to homosexuals because we are perverted, say the straight  
parents, to the point of keeping us from teaching and any occupation  
dealing with children, so why, now, should I do childcare for women  
with children, whether they are poor, don't have husbands, or even  
if they are gay? I'm gay and with that I accept not having child-  
ren, I do not want children, and I do not want to have anything to  
do with children.

Where I'm coming from about kids is liking them O.K. but just  
not having much contact with them. My only brother was one year  
younger and my only younger cousins lived in Minneapolis and came  
down once a year. I didn't like to babysit because the thought of  
the parents coming home drunk made me cringe.

When I was a teenager everyone reinforced my behavior with kids  
and told me I was good with them. But because my interactions were  
so far between, I never have had much confidence in my ability to  
come through in a pinch and calm a crying child. I'm only just  
most recently realizing that I can meet children's needs, like  
Saturday night when I did overnight care at Sparky, I got them  
all to bed without crying just by kissing them. But still I have  
real problems with getting angry when a child is crying for no rea-  
son that I can see. Sometimes I can't control it and it scares me.

I didn't like babysitting either, but I did it because I always  
needed money. And, yes, the parents were usually offensive when  
they came home drunk: Because of that I've come to realize that  

part of my not wanting to be around children has been environmental.

Straight households are oppressive to everyone including the child  
and the babysitter. Children in this situation have caused me a  
lot of grief. They have called me names in front of their parents,  
they've asked me if I am a man, and they've even told their parents  
that I had a girlfriend over. Statements like that aren't so un-  
comfortable for me in the environment I'm in now, but because of  
the children's honest and eager observations in the straight home  

I usually had to make some witty and self-put-downish comment to  
appease both child and onlooking parent. These circumstances were  
great reinforcers of the self-hatred most gay people live with in  
this stiflingly straight society. The flaw in my resentment is  
that it was directed toward the children involved rather than ag-  
ainst the oppressive straight, nuclear family.

Castigation of gayness is induced by straight society onto not  
only gay people but children who will carry on that attitude. It  
is self-contemptuous of me to promote anti-homosexuality when doing  
childcare, and I will not do it. When I babysat in the straight  
environment that is what I had to do, and that is one reason why I  
no longer wanted to do childcare in any capacity. In such an envi-  
ronment a gay person has no stake in the care and development of  
any child--not even her own--and is forced to contribute to her  
future oppression. This society brainwashes children to hate and  
adopt biases against people for no direct reason other than that's  
what the parents were taught. I refuse to promote sexist, homo-  
sexist, racist and fascist attitudes in children I do childcare  
with because it is ultimately self-destructive to me and the soci-  
ety I want to live in.

I agree with you. There are many real and material reasons why  
gay women don't seek out children to relate to. Over the years  
gay people have been burned, castrated, hung, jailed and beaten  
for even looking crossways at children. And if those consequences  
seemed far removed to me, very few times have I related to a child  
since I've been gay without looking over my shoulder to see who's  
watching and what they're thinking. Society has planted the seed  
and I carry it and torture myself.

Volume 3 Numbers 243

One of society's most basic and powerful psychological weapons  
against gay women is that living with a woman means you're cutting  
yourself off from having children. Most gay women have to deal  
with that within themselves very early. If it is overcome, it's  
done in varied ways, but certainly one defense is to reject child-  
ren and motherhood as anything valuable.

I have also felt paranoid constantly with children because of  
some of the things you pointed out. But another problem for me  
has been even accepting my responsibility to children because I am  
not ultimately responsible for them and because of my painful inter-  
actions with them in the past. Also, because of my isolation in a  
rural, extended-family type community I was not early aware of the  
many women who have to raise their children alone, I was not aware  
of the difference class makes in childcare responsibility even if a  
husband is present, and I didn't take into account that all women  
are socialized to be child-bearers and that I was casting off that  
role earlier than many women would. I now accept responsibility  
for children because they are people who need to be cared for be-  
cause of their age and because in primary parent/child relation-  
ships the daily child-rearing falls on the mother's shoulders.  
Women with children need to be freed from that.

My transition to taking responsibility for other women's child-  
ren hasn't been smooth. The glaring facts remain unresolved and  
undealt with that: 1. I have qualms about doing childcare for  
women who relate to men exclusively because those relationships  
create more space for heterosexuality and do nothing to lessen my  
oppression as a gay woman. 2. I question the criticism from mid-  
dle-class gay women with children whose approach it is that I am  
privileged not to have children and responsibility for them because  
where they are coming from is a doubly privileged position from  
mine: their money could buy childcare services and their hetero-  
sexual relationship was socially sanctioned. 3. I resent being  
told by new gay women with children that my conscious decision at  
the age of 13 that now gives me more time than a woman with child-  

ren, is a privilege because the ensuing, daily oppression by  
straights from my decision was certainly a long unrewarded and  
painful struggle--while heterosexual standards rewarded marriage  
and children.

I understand the unsmoothness of the transition. I have simi-  
lar qualms, but I think the problems between gay women and mothers  
are caused by oversimplification on both sides.

Your number one in the last paragraph doesn't fall into that  
category, however. I have the same gut level feeling when I think  
about doing daycare for heterosexual women. But we are assuming  
that struggle within them isn't going on. Last night at the Sparky  
general meeting which 3 heterosexual mothers came to, I saw them  
struggling with and realizing why we as gay women did not want sin-  
gle men parents in Sparky--and how it was oppressive to us. The  
other thing I always want to be careful of is to not rule on other  
women's sexuality or make my responsibility to them contingent on  
their being gay.

I know it's hard to listen to the anger of a mother when she's  
middle class and more privileged than you in some ways. If it were  
a working-class mother you could hear the anger and oppression much  
more clearly, but it's there in a middle-class mother also. (A lot  
of times I catch myself playing ""More oppressed than thou"" and have  
to stop and make myself listen to what the woman is angry about.)  
The oppression of motherhood hits both classes.

Not so long ago you both as gay women were all real self-right-  
eous in putting other women up against the wall about dealing with  
our homophobia. You sometimes made mistakes and were blind to the  
other oppressions that some straight women suffered. Still in the  
long run your confronting straight women was a good thing. It help-  
ed a lot of gay women, gave them space and pride and it also developed  
the consciousness of the whole movement. Perhaps the anger of  
mothers will do the same. I just think we should give them the re-  

spect we want given to gay women."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page007.txt,AintIAWoman,,7,"I cringe when I am told I am privileged not to have children.  
It's not a privilege--it's the logical outcome of my way of life  
which is fought against and sneered at in this society. If mothers  
talk privilege like that to gay women I'll bet they'll get a lot of  
women who feel they have been deprived of relating to children  
against their will. And there it is, not a matter of privilege,  
but two different types of people who are oppressed in different  
ways. It's too simple to say we are privileged because in very  
basic ways we are not.  

So why does there seem to be this ""more oppressed than thou""  
bargaining with oppressions? Last night at the Sparky general  
meeting a working-class gay woman got mad at a middle-class gay  
mother about class and the mother got mad at the other about child-  
care. They ended their exchange with one saying ""I'm sick of hav-  
ing you not listen to me about class."" To which the mother replied  
""I'm sick of having you not listen to me about the oppression of  
children and mothers."" The mention of one oppression should not be  
used as a defense against having to deal with another's oppression.  

But this goes on a lot. It's because of the peculiar context in  
which oppression is seen within a community whose members all have  
been maimed by society in one way or another. In order to overcome  
the psychological effects of oppression you must become angry and  
realize that instead of there being something wrong with you, there  
is something wrong with society and those oppressing you. Once you  
do that you can respect yourself. Others also, if they are urged to  
consciousness about gayness, class, or motherhood, come to respect  
what you have done and what you say politically. And that is how  
oppression becomes a source of community respect instead of a  
scourge.  

Because this is a political community and politics has to do  
with oppression, oppression and good politics are basic sources of  
respect. They, therefore, take on additional social and emotional  
meaning and that's where things get messed up. Oppression almost  
becomes a commodity that people bargain for because their egos are  
tied up in there somewhere.  

""More oppressed than thou"" is an offshoot of this. It says  
""I'm more oppressed than you are so I don't have to deal with your  
problem."" We must begin examining our motives when we are defens-  
ive in such a way about someone else's oppression.  

The following was an open letter from a mother written to women in the community who had  

I definitely agree that all of us in the Iowa City Women's  
Community have to deal with others' oppression by watching how we  
have been oppressed affect how we relate to other women and vice  
versa. I don’t think that mutual respect for each other's oppres-  
sions is enough without some attempt by all to help equalize our  
situations. I've never seen middle-class women do much about how  
they oppress working-class women by their privileged background  
that gives them many, many advantages working-class women never had  
and never can have. Class differences change the degree to which a  
mother or a gay woman is oppressed and I want middle-class women  
in this community to start dealing with that fact and listening to  
working-class women's suggestions on how they can change at the  
same time as we're listening to them about gayness or motherhood.  

Getting back to childcare more specifically, though, the cir-  
cumstances seem to be that women who have had children and are  
raising them are defensive about women who haven't had children  
beginning to share responsibility for children even to the point of  
doing it without the mother. It's true that it isn't that easy to  
erase the oppression of motherhood, but women without children are  
trying to help.  

I can relate to mothers' defensiveness about women without  
children suddenly taking responsibility for children because of the  
similarity between that and the old gay/new gay situation. After  
having been gay for 14 years myself there are now many, many women who  
are gay and share some experiences, but who will never feel the op-  
pressive atmosphere of isolation, condescension, fear of exposure,  
and loneliness that I lived with until the gay women's community  
blossomed in Iowa City within the last two years, and there are  
times when I resent newer gay women talking about the oppression of  
gayness because they've never gone through and never will need to  
experience what long-time gay women have had to go through. In the  
same way women just recently sharing childcare responsibilities  
will never be as oppressed by isolation, decision-making, lack of  
time for themselves, etc., that mothers have experienced. And all  
these reasons validate some lack of trust.  

The whole point of sharing childcare responsibilities for me is  
to equalize the burden that keeps some women busy 24 hours a day.  

But at the same time an exchange of consideration, and attempts at  
respect from learning other women's needs, must be happening or the  
""more oppressed than thou"" syndrome will never end.  

You have all the options--whether to take  
childcare seriously or not. You get so  
pissed off when people don’t show up to  
work daycare and you're ""stuck there."" Yes,  
you should be pissed but many women with  
children in this town are ""stuck there"" 24  
hours a day, seven days a week and no one  
shows up to relieve her. It's so fucking  
difficult for you to be inconvenienced.  
Well, women with children are often incon-  
venienced 24 hours a day. You say you are  
so busy--you don't have time, or damned  
little time. You work full time--so fucking  
what? Women with kids do it every day and  
do childcare the other 16 hours every day.  
You can't even find time to do it once a  
week. You think childcare ends at 5:30.  

You say you have other time commitments.  
You have that option. Perhaps AIAW could  
be put out by working-class women with  
children if they weren't stuck home with  
their kids. But you say you're too busy!  
What shit.  

Your amount of commitment to childcare  
seems to vary according to your social  
life. If you're into a relationship, it  
often causes you to fuck off childcare re-  
sponsibilities. You have that option.  
Women with children don't. You say you're  
freaking out--having personal hassles. You  
have the option to spend two weeks freaking  
out, unable to do anything else (namely  
childcare). Women with children have to  
freak out about the responsibilities of  
childcare.  

You never think of having relationships  
with children. You might get off on them  
occasionally when you have to do childcare  
but you never ask them to do something that  
could be fun for both of you--you always  
ask another adult.  

When you're with someone constantly, it  
usually puts a strain on your relationship.  
Low-income women with children have no op-  
tions about being with their kids constant-  
ly.  

You stay up all night having a good time  
with adults and when you come to daycare,  
you fall asleep or are just too burned out  
to relate to the kids. You're ripping off  
the kids. It's also an option that women  
with kids don't have. Women with kids  
can't say ""I'll stay up late and have a  
good time 'cause I can do my 4 hours child-  

care tomorrow and go home and take a nap.""  
It's childcare 24 hours a day all the time.  

About My Own Kids  

You expect me to bring them (or be respon-  
sible for finding a ride) to and from day-  
care. Why can't you? You ask me if I'm  
going to bring them to the dance/party or  
whatever, 'cause you'd really like to see  
them. Why can't you take them?  

Kids have to eat three meals a day. One's  
at daycare...where do you think the other  
two come from every fucking day? You  
think they look real nice in butch drag.  

Do you ever buy or get them clothes? You  
think kids need shoes. Who paid $7.00 a  
pair for them? And when I think that I get  
more help with my kids than any other woman  
with kids that I know, it makes me sick to  
hear your excuses. I say you'd better  
think a long time about the lip service  

you give to childcare 'cause what's getting  
done in this town by women without kids  

for women with kids is piddly. It's only  
at your convenience that you relate to kids  
and that ain't enough.  

Additions while talking with two other  
mothers  

1. You don't have to keep your house  
straightened, there are no kids around to  
trip over junk or eat things off the floor.  
And, if you want to clean house, it will  
stay clean for more than five minutes be-  
cause there's no kids to mess it up.  

2. Some landlords won't rent to people  
with kids--especially single women with kids.  

3. You can choose what political activ-  
ities you want to be involved in. Women  
with kids have to choose daycare or there  
won't be daycare. You can put childcare  
on a charity basis.  

4. You have the option to do childcare  
only when  

a. you're in the mood  

b. you like the particular children  

c. all the supplies are provided by  
the parent  

d. the kids are the age you get off on  

e. there's only one kid  

f. you like the mother  

g. the mothers give you ego-building  

thanks  

5. You can be ignorant of legalities  
concerning kids (custody etc.) and rely on  
the mother ""to fill you in.""  

6. You can go anywhere on a moment's  
notice.  

7. You can make definite plans and then  
not have to figure out childcare arrange-  
ments.  

8. You can go to social events and only  
think about refreshments for yourself. You  
can have parties and only think about ac-  
commodating adults.  

9. You can plan your money around one  
person.  

10. You can carry around an appointment  
book and be sure of meeting all of them.  

11. You have the option to think all this  
stuff is picky.  

12. You only have to worry about winter  
clothes and other necessities (like food)  
for yourself.  

13. You don’t have to spend money/space  
on cribs, toys, etc.  

14. You can have a house full of neat  
shit that kids would wreak.  

15. You can rely on mothers to get kids  
to and from you if it is just as much of a  
hassle for both of you.  

16. You can avoid or reduce the amount of  
energy spent dealing with schools, doctors,  
welfare, and grandparents.  

17. Basically, you have two options that  
women with children don't have:  

1. to not relate to children  
2. to relate to children only under  
certain conditions."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page008.txt,AintIAWoman,,8,"Think about what it would be like to live my life

This may take the form of an open letter to all non-biological
mothers, those of you who refer to yourselves as such and to those
of you who are not doing much childcare, for some reason or another.
I would like to start out by saying that we need help! Having a
child is a never-ending responsibility. It is too often a very fine
thing, but it is often a burden too. Mothers are accused of not
trusting you enough and of trying to exercise too much control over
our children. I want to trust you implicitly but it has been my
experience that surrogate parents will always split for one reason
or another. I can only trust you so far when I realize that your
commitment is only good as long as you are living with me or as
long as you live within geographic proximity. For this reason, I
am learning to take all the help I can while I can get it, but
taking long-term commitments lightly.

I don't want complete control of my child but I know that I
will be the only person who will be consistently responsible for
his life for the next 15 years, so I have to retain at least 30%
control. Oftentimes it is 90%. It is unfortunate that adults do
have to exercise control over children, but it is unnecessary to go
into reasons for this. Even when I've lived with two other people
who are sharing responsibility, I find that I'm the only one who
cares if he spends too much time at daycare. Children burn out on
one place and one group of people also. I'm the only one who washes
his hair or cleans up his room. As a mother I am forced into the

position of coordinator of his care. I'm the one who has to see
that some adult is with him at all times. Oftentimes my only re-
sources for childcare are other biological mothers who shouldn't
be asked to take on additional responsibility. These are the peo-
ple, however, who understand and share my problems. We are forced
to help each other for lack of non-parents taking responsibility.
Please do childcare for us and don't ask us to shuffle for it,
to always have to ask and to be sure to say please and thank you.
Call me and ask if you can take him that night or just go pick
him up from daycare and leave me a note on the blackboard. Show
me I can depend on you. I will burn out. Without your help I
will soon be looking for a divorce from my child. Also please
don't choose female children over males. We couldn't determine
the sex of our children. Mothers of male children need even more
help. It is impossible for me to reinforce non-sexist behavior
alone. This may sound very preachy and sometimes bitter. That
wasn't my intention but it might serve to demonstrate my situation,
and those of most other mothers that I have talked to. I should
add that there are a whole lot of women in this community who are
doing a fantastic job as non-biological mothers but there are too
many of you who do little childcare because you have other commit-
ments. Well I have other commitments too and there is a lot more I
want to do that I don't have the time for. Think about what it
would be like to live my life.

""Et cum spiritu tuo.

* “and with your spirit.”

I am a gay working-class non-biological
mother. I grew up as the oldest in a
Catholic family of eleven, and have done
childcare duties at home and for other
people for eleven years as a babysitter,
substitute parent (both mine work full-
time), and daycare worker. I do regular
childcare, with the help of my living
collective, outside of daycare for four
children from the women's community, plus
irregularly for several others. I have
a commitment to three ""regulars"" I con-
sider to be ongoing until it's not needed
anymore, and want to maintain close rela-
tionships with them for as long as possible.
I guess that hinges on their agreement to
that when they're all old enough to make
a choice, as I have done. My involvement
with all three of them came about through
daycare, before I knew their mothers, or
had specific friendships with them. This
situation has sort of free meaning to me
that I value. I do not want my relations
with these kids to be controlled by their
parents or the people they live with.
About ten children were walked out of my
life over a political split between adults
in a center here this year, and the thought
of it happening again is frightening. I
love them a lot and have as much right
and responsibility as a parent - and I am

determined not to fuck that off. I do
think that some agreements exist
between biological/legal parents and us

others, but I think it's wrong for rela-
tionships between adults to dictate or

control relationships between adults and
kids. It's unfair and fucked-up for all.

Childcare has been a primary commitment
for me since before the beginnings of my
feminist politics and involvement in the
Iowa City women's community. I came to
this town in 1969 to go to college on the
typically inadequate crumbs that the Uni-
versity and government dole out to lower-
class kids trying to ""better themselves""
and class climb. It's a burn and an in-
sult -- but that's another story, right?
Bullshit...

Anyway, after my dazzling freshman year
and another stint at home, DOING 24 HOUR
CHILDCARE FOR A WORKING CLASS WOMAN, I
moved to Iowa City permanently and delib -
erately started working in a daycare cen-
ter because I needed to find a place to
live and support myself. My growing fem-

inist consciousness, spurred by the vari-
ous males, liberals, and/or straight midd-
le-class students around me, directed me
to Women's Liberation. There were daycare
centers, a living collective, a gay cell,
music cell, and Ain't I A Woman? - all of
which interested me. I chose daycare be-
cause it was open to me, and I liked kids
because I did think everyone should relate
to them for humanitarian reasons about
their value as the ""future of the Revolu-
tion."" I also knew there was to be a new
women's collective that I wanted to live in.

When I was home babysitting and working
my ass off all the time in my younger days,
however, kids were clearly an economic bur-
den and too often an emotional one, too.

My mom cracked up and almost died twice in
19 years. I always dug the idea of schools
or communities where kids could live and
work and run their own lives. (Actually, in
those days I didn't want to go to school, and
used to imagine that work was easier and
better than school.) I also wanted such

a thing because I really knew where I was
at in the social strata, and I wanted
upper-class kids to fork over the loot and
live like the rest of us. All those times
in school when I was called brassy and be-
lligerent, all that shit I took about how
if I'd behave and lose weight and tow the
line, then those things would come my way...
Fuck it! I made my decision not to get
married or have kids for class reasons

more than anything else, and I consider
that to be a political example of what
makes the working-class foxier than the
middle-class. I resent any woman of eco-
nomic privilege telling me how oppressed
she is as a mother if she is unwilling to
recognize my experience and commitment as
equally valid and substantial. I have
very certain ideas about the nuclear fami-
lies, monogamies, and parental authority,
stemming from my childhood and adult ex-
periences with daycare, and those must be
struggled with too.

The new collective finally formed above
the daycare center I worked in. The co-ops
were getting it together to get University
faculty houses, by one means or another,
and ours (University Parents’ Care Collec-
tive) was first. The center was all white,
and almost totally middle-class and Univer-
sity connected, as students and faculty.

Our collective was supposed to clean the

house every week and work the first and
last hour shifts of every day, (five days

a week) in return for the use of its
second floor and ""kitchen privileges.""

My commitment to the center and its mem-
bers was dependent on that and my politics,
those being that daycare was for freeing
women and children and smashing monogamies
and families (as all those parents will
heartily and piggishly attest to.) All
this time my other politics, including
class, were in constant turmoil.

The group I identify with has few mem-
bers, and this was especially true here
when less than eight feminists worked in
daycare. My involvement with childcare
was a sore spot and a political division
in the AIAW collective and the whole
women's community for a long time. I've
felt the frustration of mothers and know
the meaning of their anger against women
without kids. I've had to deal with it
between myself and those women, and be-
tween myself and oppressed mothers. I've
been reactionary in situations about kids
sort of like parents are, like not trust—
ing the capabilities of non-mothers, just
taking over duties and hassles rather than
explaining things, and not dealing with
their fears or uptightness because they
weren't real to me, and I considered them
all excuses and bigotry. I do know what
it is to be burned on a commitment to child-
care, and I've heard a lot of pigshit from
those who wouldn't deal with their ageism,
privilege and laziness, but there has to
be determined struggle by all of us, and
that includes over the oppression that
non-mothers, especially gay and lower-
class ones, suffer at the hands of this
rich, male society of nuclear families.

Working in the cooperatives here is
oppressive to women, gays, and working-
class people. We've taken endless shit
from packs of middle-class professors,
students, and hippies. Just such a group,
supported by their tied, true or groupie
women, excluded gay feminists from the
first center established here by Women's
Liberation, (Dum Dum Daycare Center). It's
hard enough to struggle over political
issues, let alone try to challenge
parental superiority and ownership when
mothers are paranoid, untrusting and li-
beral to the point of being pawns in men's
hands. We've been threatened with financial"
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page009.txt,AintIAWoman,,9,"insecurity, no daycare, and the police --  
all of which the reactionaries came through  
on. We had to attend meetings with men  
who were exploitative and condescending.  

We had to listen to the endless hassles of  
married women who oppressed us as lesbians  
and resisted feminist politics like the  
plague. If we could even be gay “publi-  
cally"" it meant practically nothing be-  
yond wearing a button in a foreign lang-  
uage. Co-opted, lost and liberalized.  
There were major freak outs over teaching  
female children to defend themselves and  
not be weak, and trying to make boys be  
less macho, straight and domineering. The  
parents thought we were horrible and fas—  
cistic, and their liberal jive didn't fool  
anyone on our side.  

This summer the parents in the co-op I  
lived in expelled 20 of us—two mothers,  
plus gay and straight volunteers of both  
sexes. Specifically the splits were over  
feminism, separatism, and the gay sociali-  
zing of children. The women of our group  
wanted two days a week of only women in  
the center, and commitment by all the wo-  
men to struggling towards a radical feminist  
analysis dealing with class, race, and  
gayness. We confronted them, hassled,  
were left alone in the center, threatened  
with the police and totally ejected when  
the token Marxist family went on vacation  
and the remaining liberals could get away  
with really exercising their power as they  
saw fit. TOTAL PIC.  

So, the ""radicals"" were shoved out and  
our troubles were only beginning. The  
faction had to form a new center (Sparky  
Daycare Center), and the group was already  
fucked-up. We had defended irresponsible  
volunteers with transitory commitments to  
show solidarity, and had to hassle with  
men — most of whom were bad news, and I  
knew it from my past dealings with them,  
and the way they reacted to separatist  
struggle among the women. They were a  
cause of splits among us.  

The women finally split from the men  
and formed B.O.S.S. (Bitches Out to Stomp  
Sexism) and recommitted themselves, nam-  
ing the Lesbian Daycare Manifesto from  
RAT as the basis of their daycare politics.  
As it happened too many times in the past,  
a number of ""committed radicals"" went  
their merry way, committed to their social  
lives and despicable degeneracy. Distrust  
flourished. During these times I was  
criticized by a member of AIAW for not  
acting collectively by making decisions  
and judgments on my own, or with a few  
members of B.O.S.S. At the time I was  
used to acting on my own because I'd never  
been in any affinity group in daycare out-  
side of occasional solidarity in our liv-  
ing collective, and most of B.O.S.S. and  
Sparky was irresponsible, untrustworthy,  
and had bad politics, if any. But she  

was right, and I tried to struggle over it  
in light of the fact that primary collec-  
tives were to be discussed, etc... The  
B.O.S.S. politics were rhetoric, though,  
and I knew in my gut that I could not con-  
tribute much support to the group. I left  
with a letter to B.O.S.S. of political  
criticisms and disagreement - and a commit-  
ment to Sparky's mothers and children and  
feminist daycare.  

Most of the working-class women left  
B.O.S.S. and the remainder, dominated by  
middle-class guilt and service politics  
outside B.O.S.S. decided to form a free  
childcare center for service to working-  
class and lower-class women. This was a  
total political turnabout, and I had gut  
feelings of revulsion to the idea of those  
women ‘serving women of my class - or even  
thinking they could. It was Classism Su-  
preme, and I only recently realized exact-  
ly how bad that was. Co-opted, liberalized.  
I knew the implications of their classist  
guilt, irresponsibility, and rotten politi-  
cal methods - and I was depressed about the  
fate I expected for working-class women and  
children in their hands. But the children  
I was involved with were dependent on Spar-  
ky and it was the women's community center,  
or so parts of the community thought. If  
I had fully realized the havoc ""service""  
daycare was going to wreak on the women  
staffing it - especially the gay, working-  
class volunteers who have been systematically  
insulted, ignored, de-classed, and generally  
shat on, I would have hid the insurance  
policy, grabbed the kids and split for Des  
Moines. The Lesbian Daycare Manifesto had  
been discarded like a menu.  

AMG Mujer?  

The sore points of anger over women in  
the community not relating to childcare  
came to a head at a general meeting  
slated for confrontation and lots of jus-  
tified, long-simmering resentment. But  
bad methods and confused politics domin-  
ated that anger, and it all started up  
after I and a middle-class woman from  
B.O.S.S. had a fight with another middle-  
class woman who had been irresponsible  
about childcare and refused to come to the  
meeting. I completely lost my temper and  
most of my rage against her at the time  
was based on the fact that she was priv-  
ileged, and had been making $300 a month  
as a work-study student for sauntering  

into the center a few hours a week. If  

I recall she was told to return all the  
money to Sparky and has not to this date.  
Count on middle-class women to allow  
something like that. I regret that  
fight, but I think it did have a heavy  
impact on the previously uncommitted  
women at the meeting, and on the whole  

community.  

Women who previously couldn't be moved  
by anything short of fear of death, were  
organizing and committing themselves.  

The first non-biological mothers group  
(Non BMs) formed out of women at the meet-  
ing who had not done anything for mothers  
or children, and needed a group to organ-  
ize themselves. Non BMs got their shit  
together fast, and has been responsible.  

But the formation of this group sort  

of left me out in the cold. It wasn't for  
me because I had always done childcare  
and didn't need the consciousness-raising  
that non BMs did. And it was closed to  
me, particularly, because everyone was  
pissed about that fight. The other wo-  
man was also excluded when she tried to  
join, because she was a member of B.O.S.S.  
and also, I think, because she was on  
the outs, too. For a while I felt that  
she should have been able to join because  
she hadn't really been any more together  
than Non BMs had, and that she needed the  
organization and discipline. However, this  
was an incorrect idea, because it ignored  
the fact that she was responsible for her  
behavior and lack of direction primarily,  
and it was up to her to take first steps  
to change. And she hasn't so far. The  
point I thought I was trying to make is  
that personal rifts and relationships  
seem to have an unfair influence on the  
membership and political direction of  
groups.  

Anyway, all these months relating to  
Sparky almost totally on my own has been  
a drag. Just like it's a drag to live  
alone or virtually alone and try to do  
childcare outside of daycare all by my-  
self. I now live in a gay, working-class  
collective of three women and four oc-  
casional (definite) kids. Changing my  
living situation has seemed like an ans-  
wer to some of my hassles this year.  

Very recently the volunteers of Sparky  
started to organize in protest against  
Sparky being a service daycare center.  

We all feel a need for the center as a  
place for the children we have, and a  
place where we can freely live as gay  
women, committed to radical changes,  
political education, fighting classism,  
and controlling our interest and labor  
and needs. B.O.S.S. had disintegrated.  

February, 1973  

into the Planning Committee, set up as  

an administrative group to do that kind  

of work. But most of us were too unor-  
ganized and untogether to keep the com-  
mittee and a few other women from con-  
trolling Sparky's money, lease, policies,  
and membership. I want Sparky to serve  
those people who are involved in it--  
that means the community women and the  
working-class mothers and children who  
are members. The mothers started organ-  
izing because some mothers, including  
two Sparky mothers and one non-member  
working-class mother thought the interests  
of working-class women were being trampled  
by the gay non-mothers (half of whom are  
working-class) who opposed the notion of  
service. We did not want to ask community  
children to leave because they were  
""privileged"" according to those mothers,  
because they were either middle-class or  
lived within a middle-class political  
community. This was outrageous - that  

us working-class women were privileged  
because of our radical politics and high  
consciousness. De-classed, co-opted, in-  
sulted. We wanted our children in a  
center that we worked to maintain, and  
that would fulfill our physical, political  
needs. The results of the mothers' meet-  
ings called for such things as male pa-  
rent membership, supported by the sexist  
and homosexist declarations of the mother  
organizers; that women with high feminist  
consciousness could and should deal with  

males and heterosexuals in the other co-  

ops to free up space in the service center.  
When the last general meeting of all Sparky  
workers and mothers was held it was clear  
that the mothers whose rights were supposed-  
ly so threatened by feminism and gayness,  
had not even heard a word of what we were  
concerned with - and showed definite in-  
terest in struggling over the issues. So  
much for the ""low consciousness-potential""  
that lower class people are thought to  
have. And fuck middle-class attitudes  

that say that politics have to be soft-  
pedalled to the masses so they'll fight in  
the Revolution. What bigotry. Patronized,  
manipulated, and co-opted. The working-  
class mothers of Sparky are proof of our  
revolutionary potential.  

Before the last general meeting, all the  
gay working-class volunteers met and came  
up with a statement of criticism and poli-  
tics that included our refusal to work with  
men, and our commitment to struggling  
over how we oppress mothers. We also called  
for struggle from mothers, straight women,  
and middle-class women over what we say is  
our oppression, and the radical analysis we  
support and want to practice. We read it  
at the meeting and the discussion was hope-  
ful, I think, even though there are seri-  
ous splits between some of the mothers and  
a couple of volunteers and the rest of us.  

Some of the things that concern me about  

Sparky are the fact that the almighty  
University-connected women in the center,  
and that one dissenting collective contri-  
butes a large amount of Sparky's income so  
they can threaten our existence anytime.  
They have, in fact, already done so.  

Last month when they proposed complete  
service daycare, and that community child-  
ren must leave, they withheld the money  

in lieu of our protest, and the working-  
class cook's salary went unpaid, not to  
mention the rent, utilities, and food bill.  
They finally paid the money, and a proposal  
was made at the last meeting that, since  
we have to depend on their money, that  
they give the center a month's notice to  
recover it in case of further trouble.  

So now the Planning Committee is experi-  
mentally dissolved, and we are taking a  
month to discuss and explore a new struc-  
ture for Sparky. The mothers are going to  
continue to meet, as will the first non-  
BMs group. The rest of the volunteers  
have several options; to continue individ-  
ually, reform the Planning Committee, or  
form similar non-BMs groups. My living  
collective has joined a non-BMs group:  
with seven other women, five working-  
class, and all gay. Two members of our  
group are 18 or under, and one is over  
thirty. One has been married, one had a  
baby that she didn't keep, and one had an  
illegal abortion. Most of us work, and two  
of us are students. We intend to continue  
our group regardless of the specifics of  
Sparky's new structure. And our commit-  
ment to mothers, children, and our politics."

and the

sparkettes""

Ten of us are now members of a collective called ""Non Biologi-
cal Mothers Group One."" It is basically a support group of women
new to childcare who have come to see childcare as a political
priority. The process that brought us to the place where we knew
we needed the kind of collective we have was a long, often con-
fusing and scary one. We feel it's important to analyze the con-
ditions that brought us here, and explain the reasons our collec-
tive is necessary to us.

When the Iowa City WLF broke into cells in the spring of 1970,
one of those cells was Daycare. It was responsible for establishing
Dum-Dum Daycare Center, the first cooperative, free daycare
center in Iowa City. Since its formation about a half-dozen simil-
ar centers have formed, and many women in the Women's Movement
have volunteered at some time or other at the two centers which
were politically closest to us. For political reasons explained
elsewhere in this issue, a group of gay women split from an exist-
ing center and formed Sparky Daycare in the spring of 1972.

None of the ten of us participated centrally in any of this
history. We were all involved in political projects such as women's
medicine, providing transportation services to local poor people,
AIAW, gay consciousness raising, etc. etc. There have been over a
dozen groups in those two years, some for the whole period, most
shorter-lived. Daycare was looked upon by most non-mothers in the
Women's Movement as another group with political importance, but
no political priority.

The error in this analysis gradually became clearer to many wo-
men in the women's community. We realized that childcare counts
so much it should go without saying; that childcare is essential
to the political life of a community which is not going to exclude
biological mothers, and which envisions a society that includes
all mothers equally. We came to this analysis as a result of angry
mothers finally forcing us to recognize their oppression and act
to change it. Another factor was a growing awareness of our age
chauvinism that was brought about at the insistence of women in
the community eighteen years old and under. And finally, having a
daycare center available that was controlled by women, all of whom
were gay, gave us a forum that allowed us to see how providing
childcare was identified with meeting our own needs.

In this case a beginning analysis was far easier than handling
the uproar all of our minds were in as we saw the direction that
had to be taken. That uproar reached crisis proportions at a Sparky
General Meeting that was called by the small collective of women
who had been running and staffing the developing daycare center in
temporary facilities. Many women attended the meeting who had only
just committed themselves to the politics and action of doing
childcare. We were confused about our responsibilities, afraid of
the confrontation of mothers and full of guilt because of the va-
lidity of their anger towards us. Overall was a feeling of power-
lessness; we were at a loss for direction. The group was diverse,
unorganized except that we all wanted to relate to Sparky and
childcare.

All of these feelings had a material effect on the group. An un-
organized group has no way to deal effectively with the individual
fears and confusions among its members. Even though the general
purpose might be accomplished -- in this case, daycare staffing --
political progress by individual members is made almost impossible.
With no ways to deal with the problems of people, energies are dis-
sipated that might otherwise be channeled into growth and change.

Fortunately this kind of possible stagnation was avoided when
a woman suggested that small groups of childless women be formed
to deal with the fears and hassles many people had felt and ex-
pressed at that meeting. And we were scared! We felt awkward
around kids, and defensive when people who had a lot of experience
took over situations easily. We didn't know the ""right"" way to
handle things. We didn’t know how to play, how to talk to kids,
how to get them to do things. A thousand ""what ifs"" were in our
minds, pigshit and bullshit. And we felt powerless in the adult
group.

At the first meeting of our non-biological mothers group we dis-
cussed much of this, and drew up a statement of purpose as a first
attempt to communicate to the general membership of Sparky. This
is our statement (written mid-summer 1972):

Purposes:

1. To raise our consciousness about the oppression of biological
mothers and to struggle with one another (in this group) to change
our part in that; to not expect biological mothers to have to
raise our consciousness of how we oppress them.

2. To decide what our fears and hassles with doing childcare are,
and to work out solutions to those with other non-biological
mothers.

3. To commit each of ourselves to an established and regular amount
of time in childcare each week, that care to be divided between
work in a daycare center and in our homes. To discipline and sup-
port one another in meeting that commitment, and to increasing it
over time.

volume

4. To interact with children, not passively as babysitters but pos-
itively as people who have responsibility to children; to break
down the socialized and pigshit things in our heads and the heads
of others that work against that.

5. To build positive relationships with children.

Methods: (Methods under #1 relate to Purpose #1, etc.)
1. Meeting regularly for discussion about childcare, consciousness-
raising on the oppression of biological mothers and children.

2. Taking children in our homes for gradually increasing periods of
time. Making our homes baby-proof, safe and enjoyable for children
to be in. (Examples: poisons locked or out of reach; treasured
breakables removed; have things to play with; have some “good foods;
sleeping places with privacy -- and safety -- for children.)

When taking children in our homes, we will try not to have to
work alone; one other of us will help out. This should prevent
freakouts (for both adults and children) and backsliding on our re-
sponsibilities. It should help us learn what to do faster and make
fewer mistakes. It will also solve some problems of one person
with more than one child having to be in two places at once.

3. A proportion of the time we commit to childcare will be time
put in at Sparky Daycare Center. As a group we will guarantee Spar-
ky 60 hours a week regularly, and members of this group commit our-
selves to covering for each other, if any of us can't make her full
daycare time commitment in a given week. There are ten of us in
the group. At present three of us work full time during the hours
that Sparky is open.

So that those of us who work during Sparky's hours do not have
to put all their childcare time into non-collective, at-home child-
care, we are considering setting up nightcare at someone's house
one or more nights a week; would announce it in advance. May also
try to see that childcare gets done during events that women in
general would like to attend (parties, actions, etc.).

4. Once we have started and established as a regular practice our
childcare time commitment (both at home and at the daycare center)
we shall struggle among ourselves, with others, and -- if necess-
ary -- with biological mothers over issues which come out in the
process of re-educating ourselves to making childcare a community
responsibility. (Example: dealing with the nuclear family social-
ization that says that biological mothers are the only and ultimate
authorities about how their biological children should be treated.)

5. Given that children are people, friendships should develop if:
we discipline ourselves to spend enough time with different child-
ren and if we overcome our own fears and uptightness, so that we
can enjoy the people we are with.

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page011.txt,AintIAWoman,,11,"Looking back, from this point in the collective's life, we can  
see both benefits that we didn't anticipate when we formed and,  
also, some weaknesses in the ways we've been operating.  

Among the benefits, the first is that we've all found it much  
easier than we expected for us to begin making childcare a natural  
and basic part of our lives. Most of us are inviting children to  
be with us in our homes on a frequent, if irregular, basis in addi-  
tion to the scheduled institutional and non-institutional child-  
care we're doing.  

Second, we've found it to be true -- what AntiMass (see AIAW,  
Vol. 2, No. 9) writers say both about how politically critical it  
is for us to become Subjects instead of Objects (actors instead  
of those acted upon), and about the best work being that which you  
create out of your own needs. It was out of our needs that we ini-  
tiated Saturday afternoon, night and overnight care at the center.  
(The evening care provided by the group of gay and straight men,  
Monday - Friday, at our center made our plans for those of us who  
are employed 8-5 unnecessary.) The individual childcare we were do-  
ing on weekends made clear to us our own and others' needs for more  
regular care that would accommodate more children on Saturday af-  
ternoons and nights.  

Third, organizing ourselves has meant that we have a group  
voice/work in the daycare center's policymaking and operating.  
However, we would like to encourage other biologically childless  
volunteers who are not in a childcare-related collective to organ-  
ize themselves too, for their own good and the good of the daycare  
center. Our voices could easily get too loud or heavy among volun-  
teers in the daycare center if we're the only ones organized. (Bio-  
logical mothers are organized, and since this article was written  
another non-mothers group has formed.)  

Through this group also we've been collectively dealing with  
our financial responsibilities to childcare. The daycare center we  
all relate to needs money to run. When it began to get a lot of  
volunteers (about the time most of us got involved in it) the  
group organizing the center demanded pledges from all volunteers  
(not mothers) to be paid monthly on a regular basis. At first they  
were going to do it by taxing people on the basis of a voluntarily-  
prepared financial statement. People objected to what they called  
being ""taxed"" without having a say in how the ""taxing"" was done,  
so the group that was organizing/administering the daycare center  
decided to just ask people to pledge money out of their own sense  
of what they could afford. Both because accountability -- for how  
the books were being kept -- was unclear and sketchy and because  
some women in our collective were unable to contribute any money,  
we decided as a collective to contribute a set amount (from money  
we could hustle out of other people and from ourselves). It turned  
out later that we were able to get more than that amount together  
(when people weren't laid off from work) but it didn't seem nec-  
essary or desirable for us to put all of that into Sparky since,  
according to the budget set up and other incoming monies, they  
didn't need more than that on a regular basis. And, since our  
collective was organized to do childcare a lot of times and places  
besides the daycare center, we felt that money was needed for  
those other responsibilities (like getting equipment, toys, etc.).  

As with the time commitment thing, we've found that dealing  
with the money responsibility both to the daycare center and to  
each other (there are both working class and middle class women  
in our collective, women who live collectively and alone, women  
with debts and without, women employed and not) in a collective  
way has been better than leaving each woman to hassle with it in-  
dividually. It helps both in terms of confrontations (with people  
outside the group) and in terms of our helping deal with the class  
and time differentials amongst us within the collective.  

a woman ?  

February, 1973  

Another daycare need we found was pressing was transportation.  
Currently we pick up and take home three children regularly, ro-  
tating among those of us who have, or can hustle up, the time and  
a car.  

Finally, as a collective we've been doing physical maintain-  

ance -- cleaning, repair, and some of the building work -- for the  
daycare center. Childcare for us has meant not only spending time  
with the children, but also taking on other tasks -- including  

learning new skills related to their safety, health and develop-  
ment. Many of us had for some time wanted, for example, to do  
household repairs, electrical and carpentry work, but until the  
needs of the daycare center and other childcare commitments de-  
manded those skills we did not apply ourselves to them.  

There are at least two large criticisms that we have of our-  
selves and our work thus far. We have not yet (we've been a col-  
lective for four months) struggled enough with other biologically  
childless women and men to get them to begin to meet their child-  
care responsibilities. We see that everyone has childcare respon-  
sibilities and, in a society with an evolved political conscious-  
ness, childcare would be shared by everyone and so no burden for  
anyone.  

Also it has been difficult for us to make sure that the three  
women (of the ten of us) who live alone do not have to do child-  
care work alone (see #2 under Methods, above). The former are hes-  
itant to ask the women who live collectively for help out of fear  
that the latter will wind up having to do double their share. We  
need to do more to prevent this. Maybe going outside our group for  
childcare-sharing work is the answer. Clearly, being able to do  
childcare with the help of another adult is a luxury most biolo-  
gical mothers can't afford, so it may seem contradictory that we  
should try to meet that goal. But since we're trying to create a  
new way of raising/caring for children, we should try to live that  
new way as much as possible.  

X Doris and the Sparkettes is the new name for the  
collective & non-mothers dealing with childcare. We  
changed the name when we realized through criticism,  
that the name was offensive to mothers because it  
sounded like we thought of ourselves as mothers.

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page012.txt,AintIAWoman,,12,"about daycare licensing,

What's the set-up for federal and state funding of daycare centers?

The Office of Economic Opportunity and the Bureau of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare both have funds which can be used for daycare
but there's endless amounts of requirements that have to be met for
centers to qualify. Both of these federal agencies work together
as far as daycare is concerned. They both allot so much money to
each state annually for daycare but the state can't use that money
unless it can come up with ""matching funds"".

What are ""matching funds""?

The federal government won't directly pick up the total bill for any-
thing, so it filters its money through the state. If the state
wants to use it, it has to come up with a percentage of the cost - then the
federal money - as 3/4 of the amount can be gotten. By the end of
the fiscal year (in June) a lot of states' money isn't used up be-
cause they haven't matched it. This money is turned into the fed-
eral government and then given over to different regions around the
country. (Iowa City's region includes Iowa, Kansas, Illinois,

and other midwestern states) The money that's turned back into
the federal government can be used by a state if it can prove worthy
cause. And this money does not have to be matched.

What about Iowa's money?

In 1971 we heard from the head daycare guy here in Iowa that the Each of the 3 centers got a letter from the district supervisor

state board on daycare (they decide what kind of money they're (the state is divided up into so many districts and the ""daycare
going to get and what they'll use it for) was going to try and get consultant"" inspects all the daycare centers in their (5 county

issue the injunctions. As of today the Standards are still not
ready so we've been getting temporary licenses. (All the two-year
olds from the time of the letters are over two now:)

The age restriction isn't the only requirement keeping us from
having permanent licenses. All sorts of expensive things have to
be done to the buildings. You have the year of your temporary
license to get the things done or they can issue an injunction
against you -- but we've just been applying for temporary ones

and not getting any flack -- yet.

The standards for a permanent license are outrageous. None of them
apply to personal or emotional needs of the kids. It's all about
building improvements, fire escapes, sprinkler systems, toilets,
etc... three toilets for every kid or some nonsense like that --
plus other things that cost a lot of money that daycare centers
fronted or run by big business can afford (and profit off of) and
that places trying to provide free childcare don't have the money
for.

Did you ever get any more money after that big $5,000 ""gift""?

The $5,000 grant that Dum-Dum got was just a one-shot thing and
the next year when we tried to get some money it was too hard, too
much red tape and nonsense and no one pursued it.

What about donations to the centers?

How did you acquire space for the centers? The 75% matching arrangement also applies within the state. Any

money donated to the center can be matched by the state with 75%

that if it's economically possible it's best to try and do without
the license but if you need or want federal funds you have to be

licensed -- and that includes getting the hot lunch program, which
is about the best deal, even though it’s incredible red tape. You
have to record each grocery item you buy, and how it's used. But"
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page013.txt,AintIAWoman,,13,"funding & regulations

they will reimburse you for all of it - up to 3 meals and 3 snacks a day if you're open, say, 18 to 24 hours. So, you need at least a temporary license.

Are there any additional licensing requirements?

Yeah - another thing you have to do to get a license is have everybody who works at the center fill out a health form verifying a physical examination. The children have to have them, too. They really just want the forms sent in.

Also fire regulations - the fire marshal has to come out and inspect the building. The board of health has to inspect it too.

So after you shell out all the bucks and get an approval you send them into the daycare branch of the State Social Services. Meanwhile the regional daycare consultant is coming around to your center every now and then to look it over and report back to the state about whether or not you should be licensed. The consultant here, Pat Huxol, was the one who ""recommended"" that the centers were not ""operating legally"" because of the two-year olds. I think it was partly her responsibility that that hassle came down in the first place -- but in a lot of ways she tried to help us. She pointed out different places and ways to get things and money that we needed. She told us about Operation Mainstream and the Neighborhood Youth Corps. Those are different federal gov't projects providing jobs for low-income people of different ages. People eligible for the different projects can be employed in different community things, like daycare, and get their salary paid by the gov't. So, if you need the help, you can get staff people for the center. We've had people get those kinds of jobs doing the hot lunch program work. I think those things should be ripped off as much as possible. Those jobs should be falsified and the people should be getting the money -- regardless of what kind of work (if any) that they're actually doing.

Where do requirements for licensing come from?

The federal gov't sets up a 17 page booklet of requirements for daycare centers and the state expounds on it and makes it a little tighter. The federal ones are pretty vague and are used as an outline by the state. One of the newest ones is ""parental involvement,"" and they require that the parents be involved in the daycare center -- this is the hip thing of the year. There are all kinds of spacial requirements, etc. too. Like the federal standard will say ""adequate indoor and outdoor space for children appropriate to their ages - with separate rooms or areas for cooking, toilets and other purposes ... floors and walls that can be fully cleaned, etc."" And the state takes them and makes real picky specifications in about square feet per child, etc. So, if you meet state standards you meet federal ones.

Who administers hot lunch programs?

Hot lunch projects come under the State Department of Public Instruction. Information can be gotten from them. Over that is the Federal Dept. of Agriculture -- and that's where the money comes from. It's matched 75% from Agriculture and 25% from the State Dept. Hot lunch doesn't have to be administered for every particular child. The center has to meet licensing standards, etc. They want to know the economic background of all the people in the center. We can be pretty up front about it since we're trying to serve low income people -- but some of the centers have university people like students and professors and they still get hot lunch money.

How do you get matching funds for donations?

This is for within the state. Say if the Student Senate from the University gives us money they have to set up an ongoing contract with the county board of supervisors and it's just a lot of red tape. Another way to get money is if any ADC parents are in the center and are employed or go to school, especially women on the WIN Program, they can get $75 a month to pay for childcare -- but it's a lot more hassle and shit work for the women on ADC.

What is the WIN Program?

Work Incentive Program for women on welfare to go to school and get a job to get off welfare. I think it's best for women on welfare to just get that daycare money for themselves.

Anything else on licensing?

Yes -- you have to get incorporated. It's a legal thing that any lawyer can tell you how to do and it costs about $20. It just involves a bunch of bullshit -- you have to write out by-laws and articles of incorporation.

Some of the new proposals for standards require at least 6 staff members -- ""the nursery's childcare staff and teachers shall have a knowledge of child development and behavior and have the ability to give the children a feeling of security and comfort under the supervision of the executive or operator, be responsible for the guidance and direct childcare."" We just got forms at the new daycare center for the workers to fill out. They're part medical and part of them are for the volunteer's work experience with children (and just work experience.) I think that's how they're trying to decide if people are ""qualified"" and have that ""knowledge"" of child development. Each center is supposed to keep all kinds of forms on all the kids and workers there on file at all times. ""Personal Records for the nursery staff will be complete, including medical reports.. No administrative professional or childcare staff member shall be under the age of 16 or over the age of 70."" I imagine that the licensing standards vary from state to state.

What we've been trying to do is meet the requirements that we can without too much hassle, and shying on the ones that are too much hassle or cost too much to meet. So far we've kept temporary licenses by doing that. I don't know how long that'll last.

children’s liberation

I think children get fucked over a whole lot and they need help. They need to figure out for themselves what to do and sometimes they don't know what to do. I have my feelings hurt a lot. I think it's fair but think about other people except yourself and people should think kids do have feelings also. I think that maybe some people think that this letter or what do you want to call it is different but I'm just telling people what I think is going on.

Like adults have people to talk to. Children have to ask. People probably think this isn't the heaviest thing that I've ever wrote but somebody had to tell people what it is about and it's hard keeping it inside. I think it had to come out and people probably think that kids don't like thinking that adults have more power and they can make you leave the room and do other stuff that children don't like to do and that's what I think about stuff going on."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page014.txt,AintIAWoman,,14,"The concept of service has always bothered me  
but maybe I should explain what I mean by ser-  
vice. I mean by service those projects that we  
do for a group of people other than ourselves--  
a group we do not identify with. For instance,  
the class action workshop was a group of women  
who offered transportation to welfare mothers  
to pick up their government surplus food and  
also sent out welfare handbooks to people on  
welfare in this county. None of these women  
were on welfare themselves. Also the Free  
Medical Clinic in Iowa City, and most of the  
daycare centers including Sparky where you and  
I work.  

There are two things I really believe in--  
one is that people needing a service should  
have control over the service they receive, the  
other that people should have control over  
their own labor. Since the workers and users  
of a service are rarely the same people, it  
seems to me that someone ends up being screw-  
ed. Usually I think it is the people most in  
need of the service that suffer at the hands  
of those offering the service who normally  
have no gut understanding of the need. But  
there are so many complexities to the issue of  
daycare and in the past I think volunteers  
and workers at daycare centers have been  
forced to hide or give up their feminist poli-  
tics in order to supply service to people who  
did not accept them, to work in situations  
that were offensive to them; to find it imposs-  
ible to relate to children in any honest way.  

What you say about service is substantiated  
by my experiences. As you know, I was in the  
class action workshop and have had a lot of  
time to observe the Free Medical Clinic be-  
cause I work there.  

My reason for involving myself in class  
action workshop was that I wanted to work on  
something that had tangible results. The only  
real tangible result of that was that I felt  
that I was doing something. Is that clear?  
What I'm trying to say is that service pro-  
jects often make the do-gooder feel good. Not  
a very good reason for existence.  

The Free Medical Clinic speaks for itself.  
It serves no one but the doctors who assuage  
their guilt on the patients. The Women's  
Clinic was different, I felt, because the wo-  
men involved had a stake in the clinic because  
we needed it and had some control of it. And  
when we found that we would lose that control  
by altering its structure (by using male doc-  
tors because the female doctors would not sup-  
port us) we closed it down because it was no  
longer useful to us. That seems correct to  
me.  

Which brings me to Sparky. I don't even  
think of it in terms of being a service pro-  
ject, for two reasons. First, it meets the  

what I want to say to you in response to  
your saying that you don't see Sparky as a ser-  
vice daycare center is that some people in the  
center do and that issue is not by any means  
settled. I think it is an issue that women  
without children should be very clear in their  
heads about ‘cause we will have to fight for  
control and I think we should be sure that we  
have valid reasons for doing so. So let me try  
to explain what my reasons are ‘cause they re-  
late directly to my negative feelings about  
service projects.  

If the mothers had final control in the cen-  
ter and those of us without children worked  
there to serve mothers and to serve children  
we would be forced by the situation to see our  
function as charity. That is really all char-  
ity is--a payoff to oppressed people from the  
guilty. I do understand how in a sense that  
should seem right--a way of equalizing oppres-  
sions. But in reality, I don't think the in-  
equalities are that clear because as women we  
all carry various scars and many oppressions  
and any equalizing that is to be done should  
not be as superficial as putting in time due.  
I want and I think we can change in a more  
complete way. For instance, the term non-bio-  
logical mother has been tossed around a lot  
since the non-biological mothers group was  
formed. When we first chose that name, I  
think we only did so to identify ourselves as  
women without children. Now it has become used  
as (or at least interpreted as) us calling  
ourselves mothers. I can see how offensive  
that could be to biological mothers--that af-  
ter doing childcare for a few months, we  
think we should be referred to as mothers.  

However, I think what we should be going toward  
is in fact being mothers, toward viewing child-  
care as a women's issue--crucial to all women,  
political work that all women must work in and  
have a stake in--not something we do for those  
other women or those other women's children,  
but something we all do for ourselves. The only  
way I can see this happening is a fairly high  
level of struggle between women, all the women  
involved and to totally reject the sentiment  
that we are responsible for the oppression of  
mothers. Women without children have not suf-  
fered that oppression 'though some have suffer-  
ed other oppressions and so I can understand  
how we can rightfully be resented but we have  
not caused it. We have perhaps perpetuated it  
just as many mothers have perpetuated the op-  
pression of gay women. I think I want to walk  

In a daycare center you need furniture  
and playthings that cost a lot of money.  

One way around that is to build as much  
stuff as you can yourself.  

Wood is expensive, but lumber yards will  
always let you raid their scrap pile. They  
might even give you some wood if you say  
it's for a daycare center, but we haven't  
had luck with this. For heavier lumber  
like 4x4's and 2x4's go to a construction  
site and ask if they have any old or short  
pieces. Heavy construction sites like  
high rises or poured concrete buildings  
even though there's not a stick in them  
still use lumber for forms, scaffolding and  
supports. A poured concrete building in  
the process of being built will have a  
whole shit load of 4x4's to get rid of.  

Lumber is named for what it measures before  
it is finished and dried.  

The measurements of our lumber was 3/4""  
by 11 1/4"". First, cut the 5 pieces you  
need:  

top--12 1/4""x11 1/4""  
2 sides--11 1/4""x11 1/4""  
2 sides--10 3/4""x11 1/4""  

Then nail the top and the two square sides  
together. When you nail to a board on end  
like this make sure there is a sturdy surf-  
ace beneath the upright piece or else some  
of your effort is wasted. Use something  

of similar height to prop up the other end  
of the horizontal piece. Don't fight it.  

Next weekend we are going to begin build-  
ing the SUPER PLAYTHING. We designed it by  
gathering ideas from Big Rock Candy Moun-  
tain (published 6 times/yr by Portola  
Institute Inc., 1115 Merrill St., Menlo  
Park, Calif. 94025) and by trying to in-  
clude in it as many motor developing things  
as possible. We hope it will help the kids  
mature physically, become stronger and give  
them something to organize their playing  
around so we won't always have to be stop-  
ping fights and destruction.  

We were lucky obtaining material. We got  
the 4x4's from a heavy construction site,  
the 2x4's we found in a garage, and the  
1x2's and plywood we scavenged from houses  
the city is tearing down because of urban  
renewal. When working with lumber this  
thick that must have square ends, you  
should probably borrow a power saw. It's  
not that the wood is that hard to saw by  
hand, but your body naturally slants the saw  
one way or the other. When sawing through  
3 1/2"" of wood you may get a difference of  
1/2"" between one side and the other.

keeps slipping out of the slot (the part  
fitting into the screw should have a flat

drilled a hole in the first place and prob-

I have drawn a conclusion from my exper-  
ience about women tackling problems or  

needs of our community by providing child-  
care for our children. Second, it meets  
my need to be with children and relate to them  
in a setting that is more realistic in terms  
of my life as a gay woman. Working at Trinity  
was a sham. (Trinity is a daycare center for  
poor women who need free childcare. It's  
come by middle-class women who see it as a  
charitable babysitting service. There's little  
parent/volunteer communication at Trinity.)  
I don't feel that Sparky is like that.  
I need Sparky. It gives me support in dealing  
with children and my childcare responsibilities.  
Those two things are separate in my mind. I  
want to relate to children. Because I'm gay  
and childless, I'm isolated from them in this  
society and Sparky helps to break down that  
isolation. And because I see childcare as a  
political responsibility, Sparky helps me to  
begin to meet that responsibility.  

Your feeling about Sparky is the same as  

I agree that the service issue is still  
hanging. And in part I blame the cumbersome  
structure. Our last general meeting with the  
mothers (over a month ago) was pretty positive,  
I thought. But we've got to meet together more  

If you want the joint to be stronger use  
white glue along with the nails. You can  
also use screws, but if you do, make it  
easier for yourself and drill a hole for the  
screw with a bit slightly smaller than the  
diameter of the shank of the screw.  

the trade (either by reading, experience or  
asking someone) and you will know more  
about leverage and what tools you need.  

One more thing: the more jobs you do  
building, repairing or working on your car,  
the easier all craft and mechanical work  
will be to you because you will be learn-  
ing how to reason mechanically and spa-  

mine now. I need it too and I get scared when  
I think about the hassles and disagreements  
that go on there, particularly the issue of  
control: should the mothers have final control  
or should everyone involved have something to  
say. I get scared because I don't want to  
lose what I have gained regarding childcare.  

I don't want to slip back to that thinking of  
two years ago when I felt it was right that I  

to be on either end of a power struggle. I  
want that for everyone involved in Sparky.  
I think it’s of highest importance that  
we all continue to speak from our needs and to  
listen to the needs of everyone. I don't want  
having any control in the center to threaten  
me and could possibly take away or curtail my  
access to the center as a means of relating to  
children and the whole work involved in child-  
care.  

There's nothing more frustrating than  
spending 15 min to get a screw in--one  
quarter turn at a time. Whenever you are  
building and a task is that hard, just stop  
and think. You are either doing something  
wrong or you don't have the right tool for  
the job. For instance if it is taking you 15  
min to put in a screw, your screwdriver may  
have the wrong size blade for the slot in the  
screw; you may be trying to get by without a  
Phillips head screwdriver for a Phillips head screw; the  

Once you have the 2 square sides and top  
nailed together, nail the other two sides  
in. For ease in handling turn what you  
have built on its side like the letter ""c"",  
then when you put the other side in you can  
hold it in place by pressing down on the  
side. Remember the side you are putting in goes  
from the inside of one square side to the  
outside of the other square side. Remember the side you are  
putting in goes from the inside of one  
square side to the outside of the other  
square side.  

Now do the same with the last piece of wood  
which should also measure 10 3/4""x11 1/4"" and you're done.

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page015.txt,AintIAWoman,,15,"The dialogue (among three women) which follows took place over a period  
of time -- shortly after a not-quite-confrontation at a general meeting  

of the daycare center workers and some mothers (who were not present, I'm a 30 year old middle-class gay woman with  

but whose letters to the meeting were read) and some of the gay women regular time and financial commitments to  

who do childcare there. a daycare center. My childcare responsi-  

The three of us who took part in this dialogue decided to have it bilities are still far from ""a way of life.""  
  
I am a 30 year old working-class dyke responsible, with  
several other women, for the care of a child. I have  
regular daycare hours and regular financial daycare  

responsibilities. I also have regular non-institutional  
childcare responsibilities.  

I am newly gay, newly dealing with my working-class origins,  

thirty years old.  

I have regular time and money committ-  

ments both to a daycare center and to a child whom I am  
helping to raise collectively.  

As a gay, single woman it took me a while to understand how I think  
the anger mothers focus against me makes me angry. There is no doubt  
in my mind that mothers are oppressed. But certainly not because I'm  

a single, gay woman. Their oppression started long before I came on whoever has the privilege shares in the oppression  

the scene. Like most women, mothers have been oppressed by men in the  
heterosexual world. And whether having children was not a choice for  
mothers, it still was not something urged on them by a single, gay  
world.  

But that's not really hearing the mother who is speaking.  

It's not that  

you're privileged being a single woman, it's that you're privileged  
not to do 24-hour daycare. And having control over some of your 24  
hours has more importance than having social approval which you can do  

nothing with.  
This is a privilege hard won by lesbians who came up when there  

Social approval really means the ease with which you  
handle your economic life and the safety with which  

you live your public and private life.  

""Control"" every day from a heterosexual world that is already  
always there. The mother doesn't have to fight for that ""control""  
during the time, however piddly, that she can get away from the  
burdens of childcare. I don't know any lesbians about my age  

who are ""old gay"" and who aren't also working-class. Maybe hasty,  
maybe worth considering.  

Something about ""priority"" of oppressions and digging up the past...  
Still should listen to the experience of women who've been dealing  
with the oppression longer (old gay vs. new gay).  

But on class oppression that's equally long or longer than  
gayness (for individual women): ""length"" would screw mothers  
as a criterion, since most haven't had children as long as  
most old gay women have been gay. Do you mean ""within an  
oppression""?  

Obvious ty can't let length screw mothers and one day's oppression is  
too much, but my suspicion of heterosexual women, oppressed four or  

five years with kids, setting policy is justified.  

But the privilege is seen only within the context of women struggling to build an  
equal community of women, because outside that community that time privilege of  
single women is piddling compared to the privilege of men. And that's what keeps  

getting ignored. That's where the struggle should be but where mothers, by the nature  

of the greater oppressive power of men, understandably could never begin to make a  

dent the way they have in the women's community of Iowa City. In the ideal socialist  
world everyone does daycare. But the fact that men almost never do daycare is oppressive  
to mothers. And secondly oppressive to the single women and the single, gay women who  

are (though only recently) shouldering responsibilities to women with children.  

The double oppression, however, is when women with children ask single, gay women--  
oppressed in a much different way by men--to work in centers with men in order that  
their sons won't become too ""wimpy"" (or their daughters too strong???) The mother  
who tries to move me to the rear of my oppression with her oppression is fighting a  
losing battle. I absolutely refuse to do daycare in heterosexual, sexist and homo-  
sexist daycare centers in order to right imbalances. I will try to deal with it on  
my own territory but I'll be damned if I'm stepping back into male territory to do  
it. You cannot trade one oppression for another and believe anything's gained.  
When the angry voices have died down, that's still what I have to say.  

At present in Sparky Day Care Center ""trade"" is inappropriate since  
lesbians are ""trading"" childcare and it is not clear that mothers  
are willing to ""trade"" any struggle on homosexism.  

It is possible that lesbians may have to do out-of-  
institution childcare in order to preserve or create  
a territory.  

""Helping balance"" that (mother's) oppression is so impermanent (apropos  
remarks about biological mothers being stuck with the childcare after every-  
body else gets tired/freaks out/goes away). Part of our consciousness-  

raising about childcare should include that it should be a way of life  
for everyone, not just a do-it-in-your-spare-time thing. This applies to  
our recruiting other people to do childcare, too.  

This is true but lesbians are used to dealing with  

the ""helping balance"" of heterosexual women. They  

already control--determine-- issues for the movement.  

True they have not been working-class straight women,  
but over homosexism the shit smells the same.

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page016.txt,AintIAWoman,,16,"Somehow analyze the structure of dissension....

One lesson well learned through childcare hassles is that the only produc-
tive confrontation is in groups and in person. (That's not to say learning
doesn't go on in other ways than by confrontation.) Confrontations have
to do with politics and politics are never simple. Talking one-to-one
after a confrontation tends to so simplify the politics because no one
person can represent the variety of struggles in a group. So no headway
is made, issues are muddied, and everyone hears 2nd or 5th hand what's
been said--open range for gossip and backbiting.

among ourselves

One-to-one talking, like working out your politics alone and outside of
any collective has the disadvantages of (1) not representing the variety
of struggles in a group; (2) of not allowing the people involved to hear
the different ways a certain event in time has been perceived (factual
clarity). Collective or public talking's disadvantage of possibly not
exposing all those varieties of political struggle and fact perception
--because of the time limits, shyness or intimidation individuals may feel--
can be rectified by careful attention to the matter of hearing everyone.
Whereas, when only 2 people speak to each other -- no amount of trying to
consider other points of view, life situations, can adequately represent them
if those who experience them are absent. The need for collective and public
group struggle is clear, but we must do it in a context which does not
exclude women with less time (because of work and/or children) from partici-
pating--one of the main failings of the women's community in Iowa City.

One of the big problems is having to speak with a loud, urgent voice in
order to be heard. We've all learned that in order to get people to under-
stand and/or deal with our oppressions, we have to first convince them we
have a voice at all. So when you have to be loud and dramatic and overcome
your being used to never having a voice, not everything comes out the way
you'd want it to. Not to mention the anger. I don't see any way around
that. And people who get blown over a little by such voices should be
aware of why and give space to the women speaking. (Unless, of course,
their own space is being totally confiscated by the women speaking.

(continued)

Unless these women say things that are so blatantly racist, classist,
sexist or homosexist that it threatens whatever space other women have
for themselves.) If we only hear the ""incorrect"" thinking the oppressed
are doing, we never hear their oppression.

Postscript: Dissension with a genuine attitude of struggle (oppressed people strug-
gling together to unite without oppressing each other) is not destructive.

What is destructive is anything which prevents or inhibits that struggle,
including assuming that the other is either unwilling or unable either
to listen or to change and taking part of the facts or issue for the
whole (by listening to gossip instead of verifying the facts, by isolating
oneself from others while making judgments and/or taking actions which
affect them).

On this issue in this community-- up until very recently--these wrong
practices have been the rule rather than the exception. That is beginning
to change now and already the benefits are beginning to show. In the most
recent daycare meeting there was some indication on many sides for willing-
ness to struggle.

a lesbian mother

Here are a few viewpoints on childcare, based on my experience
as the lesbian mother of a four year old girl.

1. Female children need care from dykes, starting from an early
age. Development of a child's sexuality and body image starts at
infancy, and is much influenced by her physical contact with
adults. In the nuclear family, a woman has the status of an object,
not an autonomous being and her body communicates this concept of
femaleness to her daughter. The child is taught to be passive,
feminine, and heterosexual before she reaches school.

A dyke is a better mother than a straight woman in that respect,
because a dyke's concept of herself and other women offers the
child much more space for the growth and development of aggressiveness,
initiative, self-confidence and other dykey qualities.

2. Male supremacy is very uptight about lesbians raising girls;
we threaten them. The courts view a lesbian mother as an unwholesome
influence on a child, similar to an alcoholic or a prostitute. So a lesbian
stands a small chance of keeping custody of her child if her ex-husband,
family, or any male institution takes the slightest interest in removing
the child. The threat can be used to force a lesbian to raise her daughter
“normally” -- that is, to meet male approval. Some women have been driven
to desperate lengths to keep their children, such as changing their names
and moving out of state.

3. A female child needs good quality care from several women to
develop a strong sense of self-worth and independence from her
mother. It's real weird for a child to feel that one person cares
intensely for her and no one else gives a shit. She wonders what
would happen to her if her mother disappeared, and why no one else
bothers with her much. A child who regularly gets positive feedback
from several directions is much less easily defeated by a blast of negative
energy than is a child who is totally dependent on her mother.

A WOMAN?

speaks

4. Mother's commitment to her child.

There is, I believe, an element of choice in motherhood (although I did not
""choose"" to be oppressed and the choice I made does not justify my oppression),
and that is that any mother can choose at any time to abandon her child. A year ago, I did abandon my daughter to the care of her father. I was working and living alone with her and constantly fatigued; I knew no women who would do childcare for me (her?). So he took custody of her and she got real messed up. After much soul searching, I realized that I had to try to regain custody of her; I felt that no political involvement could be more meaningful or productive than caring for her. But then I hit the lesbian-mother stumbling block; my chances in court were poor, according to several lawyers. So finally I had to disappear with her. The alternative was to abandon her to the mutilation of a ""straight"" upbringing -- Barbie dolls, makeup, skirts, kissing up to ""Daddy.""

In response to the “old gay"" view that children are products of hetero relationships and so no responsibility of gay women:

No other woman would do this for her. I regard my decision to care for my daughter as a lesbian-feminist commitment. She is not a leftover from a heterosexual relationship; she is a four year old woman, as worthy of my time and energy (and anyone's) as any other woman.

5. Males are unfit to care for female children.

6. I will take no responsibility for the care of male children,
and question the motives of women who do take that responsibility.

feb. 73 17"
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page017.txt,AintIAWoman,,17,"Teri is a three-year-old child who was  
living with her biological mother in a  
collective situation that was intolerable  
for her: while her mother was happy there,  
Teri was not compatible with the other  
people in the collective. She needed an-  
other place to live and someone else to  
live with.  

The time it took to evolve a solution  
for Teri illustrates some things we are  
gradually becoming more conscious of: that  
“children are people who have individual  
personalities, and that all adults do not  
get along with all children (or vice versa)  
any more than they get along with all  
other adults. That children are entirely  
dependent on adults for a long time makes  
it more difficult to deal with personality  
conflicts as such: you can't just stay  
away from a child you are responsible for.  
You could get someone else to take respon-  
sibility for the child, but there are two  
things that make it real hard. The main  
one, of course, is that no one is into  
giving up as much of her self-determination  
as taking care of a child requires. The  
other thing is that the mystique of mother-  
hood still haunts us and no biological  
mother is supposed to not like her child.  
Even as people give voice to the oppression  
of mothers and try to take ""their share""  
of responsibility and hassle for the chil-  
dren we have, they are shocked and not  
understanding of mothers who could want to  
escape this hassle when hassle is all it is.  

Anyway, after much thinking and talking  
and hassle among adults, a group of people  
became ""mother"" to Teri, taking complete  
responsibility for her. We are a group of  
eight women. All of us are gay. Five of  
us are working-class, three are middle-  
class. We all knew each other, previous  
to coming together in this group, through  
the political and social functioning of  
the women's community here. Some of us  
merely knew each other, some are good  
friends, some are lovers. We came together  
at our first meeting not knowing who would  
be there -- that meeting that finally  
happened after Teri's mother came to us  
and declared her desperation -- but we  
found that it was a reasonable number of  
people (in fact an amazingly large number  
considering how much more this is than a  
commitment to daycare) and that we all  
felt we could work together. We have basic  
agreements in theory on things like good  
foods being important for children, teach-  
ing her to be strong and independent,  
teaching her to be a dyke not a lady,  
teaching her that her mind and body are  
integral and that her sexuality is part of  
that whole, etc. We want her to learn  
these things through secure but non-depen-  
dent relationships with many people which  
we think can be formed by the structure  
that we have since set up for her.

Actually, that structure was real simple  
and easy. We had a meeting, and there were  
eight of us, so we could each take respon-  
sibility for one day a week (with a double-  
up), just once a week, and we each put in  
$2 a month into expenses, that's not too  
much... We constructed a bedroom for her in  
the basement of the living collective of  
two in our group and moved her into the  
daycare center where we all work. In order  

for the adults to communicate across this  

structure, we have a logbook that accompa-  
nies Teri and her toothbrush wherever they  
go, and scheduled meetings twice a month to  
talk about things. And it all seems cool  

and easy...  

...except that Teri is a complicated  
and needful person whose needs are much  
more than just those present material ones  

that are so easily filled. We have become  
the people who are totally responsible for  
Teri's mental and emotional well-being as  
well. That is real frightening. It depends  
on us whether she is happy, whether she  
feels loved and how dependent she is. And  
it is even more frightening to have this  
responsibility and to be trying to fulfill  
it by creating a totally new structure.  

We have an analysis of what we are doing:  
it is unnecessary, if not damaging, for a  
child (or any person) to be dependent on  
one person; the structure of mono-relating  
is conducive to the development of jealousy  
and possessiveness, which are destructive.  
Living with eight people who are all equally  
responsible to her, Teri will see many  
points of view and ways of dealing with  
things as valid, rather than just one or  
two. She will be with each adult for  
short enough periods of time that that time  
can be enjoyable and not oppressive for  
either of them in terms of resentment and  
hostility over constant demands, or constant  
dependency, or just constant togetherness.  
And because her ""mothers"" do not all live  
in the same house, and have various affil-  
iations throughout the women's community,  

the situation is in a sense community,  
rather than individual, responsibility  

to her. So, we decided she would live in  
one place four days a week and that would  
be her home, a base of security for her,  
and that other days she would visit at  
other people's houses and relate to a dif-  
ferent person each day and that will be a  
really good way for her to live.  

But how do we know? Our well-thought-  
out analysis is just that: ideas. What we  
are doing has never been tried extensively.  
No one is experienced in raising a child  
until she does it, but the way we are doing  
it has not even poor tradition to back it  
up. And much as we may believe in it, it  
is an experiment whose subject is a little  
girl whose entire life is dependent on us...  
and whom we love very much. That is why  
it is so frightening.  

And we have not worked everything out  
yet even as far as practicalities go.  
Raising a child is a long-term thing and  
people have not stated specifically that  
they plan to stay in Iowa City until she  
grows up. Since it is unlikely that our  
whole group will move, going to something  
else would mean leaving Teri. Money will  
be a bigger problem as she gets older than  
it is now. What will be the legal hassles:  
will one of us have to become her owner,  
i.e., adopt her, in order for all of us to  
take care of her? What will happen if  
there are splits within the group? Because  
it is so intensely difficult to set up such  
a new structure in this society, taking  
responsibility for Teri is made even  
more frightening.  

My perspective on writing this is that  
for several months before our group formed,  
while Teri still lived in her mother's  
collective, I had been taking care of  
Teri two nights a week. Only one other  
woman in the group was relating to her on  
any regular basis at all, although we all  
knew her to differing degrees. Now Teri  
lives in my collective, her room is right  
next to mine, she shares my bathroom and  
we are just generally thrown together a  
lot. Teri knows me better than she knows  
any of the other women, she has felt closer  
to me in some ways and more secure with me,  
and this manifests itself at times in a  
kind of clinging dependency on me that is  
a source of worry and some annoyance with-  
in our group. I have been criticized for  

perhaps not discouraging this dependency  
enough. The consensus of the group now  
seems to be, however, that it is more a  
function of our prior relationship than a  
growing unhealthy relationship now, that  
it is good that she feels close to one of  
us, and that eventually she will feel as  
close to all of us.  

Teri is happier now than she was when  
she lived with her mother's collective --  
she is more sociable and more secure. She  
has been calling our collective ""my house""  
and seems to have relaxed into knowing we  
are going to be there. It seems as if for  
now our ideas are working out in practice.  
And so now we can look ahead...at the  
next 15 years.

ter she attended previously. of women in
ter serving combination none of the resolved at on over it.

of the two.

This letter concerns what I consider a blatant rip-off of working
and lower class women and children; that is, allowing Teri to
attend Sparky. My understanding is that Sparky exists to provide a service to
women and children who have no other options for childcare--i.e.
working class women. Teri clearly has other options. She is still a member of Dum Dum,
a privileged position to be in. I just cannot see how anyone can
justify her being in Sparky and taking a place so badly needed
by working class people. Every woman who staffs Sparky, the women
taking responsibility for Teri, and even myself are in very pri-
vileged positions. Despite the fact that some of us are from
working class backgrounds we have politics that put us at an ad-
vantage in being able to provide physically for ourselves. Being
able to staff Sparky comes of privilege too--you have time. It
seems very clear to me that the people who support Teri's member-
ship in Sparky are using their privilege to provide for an already
privileged child and group of people who are taking care of her.

I have heard some arguments why Teri should be there--or can
be there. I want to say that I consider some partially valid
but any validity is overridden by the fact that there are so many
working class people who need daycare. One argument is that some
of the people will not see Teri except one day a week if she is
not in Sparky and this is detrimental to developing any kind of
relationship with her, etc. Valid but what about the space she's
taking--that seems much more important to me.

Another is the women in the group taking responsibility for
Teri want to spend the time they do childcare at Sparky, not work-
ing part of the time at Dum Dum to keep Teri there. I can't see
why they would have to spend any less time at Sparky when the

I am writing this because I want you to know what my reaction to
your letter was. I don't think it is wise to meet with you person-
ally as you suggested because I think that will only increase second
and third hand misunderstanding and misinformation. In spite of
disadvantages, responding to you by letter has the advantage of be-
ing public (I will post a copy at Sparky) and of inviting comment
and criticism.

Several people made the following points at last Sunday's
meeting. I am repeating the ones I made, share or would like to
add. The issue about Teri coming to Sparky has already been set-
tled, but the things in your letter that concern her and which you
want to be policy are what I want to talk about.

1. It is offensive to regard all of the people who staff
Sparky as privileged. If politics could change class the Chinese
Revolution would have been won with ideas....

2. What support the community provides for its members is
largely 'moral'. In this society, sharing of material goods comes
out of bounty. Lower and working class women do not become privi-
leged when some of this bounty happens their way. A ""temporary""
privilege, first of all, doesn't change your class and secondly,
it's like a welfare benefit, with all kinds of strings attached.
The money your collective pledges is a good example of a temporary
privilege coming out of bounty with strings attached.

3. I pledged money and time to Sparky not because it was to
serve lower and working class women but because I had been remiss
in childcare responsibilities and I wanted to begin struggling with
that in spite of the chaos of the Sparky-Woman Center meeting. I
never supported the notion of service and found most of what was
said about lower-working class women at that meeting offensive.

4. I got tremendously pissed at your desire to serve lower
and working class women you don't yet know, when you refused to
hear what lower and working class women, who you do know, wanted.
Teri's group is as many lower-working class as middle class women.
It is insane to declare those women privileged because they are
working with middle class women.

5. Sparky will collapse unless the staff has a stake in its
operation. That stake is community children. It is not simply a
question of working at Dum Dum being inconvenient and uncomfortable.
Women who have been struggling with class and service re childcare.

The dialogue concerns itself with whether or not children
of the women’s community should be at Sparky, whether Sparky should be a cen-
ter for the women's community in Iowa City or lower and working class mothers or any
At that meeting it was decided that Teri should be at Sparky and
women's community children should be asked to leave but the issue is not

this point and the dialogue that follows presents the issue and debate going

hours at Dum Dum are not very demanding--especially when there are
seven women involved and a deal could easily be made with Dum Dum.
Working those extra hours is an inconvenience and, given the mem-
bership of Dum Dum, uncomfortable. It is the privilege of the
group not to have to be inconvenienced and uncomfortable--but
what of the ""inconvenience"" a working class woman is subjected to
because she has no childcare?

I've heard other arguments but in my mind I always reduce
those arguments down to the fact that there are other options for
Teri and she is taking the place of another child who has no other
place.

As I've written this I've reconsidered my position on Jane,
Gladys & Betsy's being in Sparky. I had thought of it as a
different situation than Teri's because of the position they were
put in by the change from feminist to a service daycare for work-
ing class women and children. However, there are now several
openings at Dum Dum and no waiting list (I don't know the situation
at other centers) and they could get in right away. They should
have been on the waiting list of some other center long ago. I
know it's true that there are only four working class children at
this point in Sparky and that Teri, Gladys, Jane & Betsy are
not taking places that should go to working class children. I
don't know the recruiting situation at Sparky, but I do know there
are a lot of working class people who need childcare and Sparky
should fill up real fast. I can only see those few children's
presence as holding up someone who needs childcare at Sparky so
I can't see putting it off until the need arises as a good thing
to do. Also, once it's upon you to make a decision I can see the
temptation as too great to let them remain.

I think Sparky should make it its policy not to allow in any
members who have other options for childcare.

I have come to understand how and why the community should meet its
own needs.

6. If I remember correctly, at about the same time as you were
digging your class origins with others, I was too. I had more
trouble (still have) with internalized classism and shuffling over
class than I did with blatant classism. The hardest thing for
me to do was to stop trying to learn about class from middle class
women. They have no stake in the analysis you ""mutually"" come up
with. I am assuming from my own experience that trying to deal
with this issue alone (alone among middle class women) has made
the going rough and slow for you. It is a mistake to regard
""temporary privileges"" as having the same effect on women from
different classes. This was offensive to the lower and working
class women in Teri's group and it is offensive to me as a working
class staff member. My commitment of time and money is at a dif-
ferent cost than middle class women because if Sparky doesn't work,
if the community doesn't work, I've got nothing. You are probably
discovering, for example, that the education you are receiving is
different from the education middle class women are receiving.

You will not be able to do quite the same things with your degree
as a middle class woman can do--and you will be pissed when people
suggest that you can. Again, I am saying this based on my own
experience. You may be able to hustle “supports” from middle class
women all your life, and while it will probably mess up your class
consciousness, it won't change your class. It should be obvious
to you that I am making the points under #6 as much for myself as
for you, but I'm taking the time to write this to you because I
believe that the criticisms in your letter come from a distorted
class consciousness.

Can I count on you to share the contents of this letter with
your collective because I think this response concerns Mary's
criticism too. I would only add for her that Teri forced us to
deal again with an admittance policy that was never firm and al-
ways contained more rhetoric and bullshit than sense.

I welcome a response if you would like to make one, either
by letter or in a group. But as I said at the beginning I will
not meet with you alone both because of the climate surrounding
this question and because the political issues always get watered
down when two people ""discuss"" them.

* Jane, Gladys and Betsy are children of women considered part of
the women's community here.

* The women's ctr.-Sparky meeting was an early meeting of people
interested in working at Sparky at which women who hadn't done
much childcare were confronted about it."

You are right about privilege in relation to working-lower class women. We are not privileged in any sense that middle class women are, and our politics and working with middle class women doesn't change that position. I know that in ten years my politics will not have changed the way I live. I was saying, however, that our politics puts us in contact with Sparky—because of that position we have primary access to it. I think my being pissed off at what I saw happening at Sparky made that somewhat unclear.

My main concern is to provide childcare for women and children on as widespread a basis as possible. Lower-working class women have the least access to childcare. In my mind, these people come first. Children who have other options and more chance to be in childcare are not my concern. It makes no difference that Teri's group has more or as many working class women as middle class women. First, she has exposure to alternate childcare situations—and second, a seven adult to one child ratio doesn't rate anywhere near the need as a one adult (mother) to one child (or more) ratio.

You say you ""got tremendously pissed at my desire to serve lower and working class women you don't yet know, when you refused to hear what lower and working class women, who you do know, wanted."" There are a couple of points I want to make about that. First, I don't want to serve working-lower class women. ""Serving"" people is romantic bullshit used by privileged groups to relieve their guilt or add a little spice to their lives. As a working class mother, I don't want your service because that means you doing it on your terms. It's like if I hear one more middle class woman say, ""Lower class people don't want charity""—I think I'll scream. You're damn right we don't want your charity—all those conditions and strings. Charity and service only are good for those dispensing it—ego trips. A good example of ""service"" or ""charity"" is what happened with Teri—no one would take her because they were supposed to—it was done to ""save"" her (social work attitude). But we do want you to do what you're supposed to do—in this case provide childcare because you have extra resources (from being childless). That means do it not because you want to for some reason but because you're supposed to. You have no right to hoard extra resources. In this society, there's no name for that kind of giving but it's not ""service"" or ""charity."" It sounds real nice to say people should serve themselves first—it doesn't have much basis in reality, however, if you're a mother—and no basis at all if you're a lower-working class person and mother. What resources do these groups of people have to serve themselves?

A second point I want to make about your statement is about the point that I have refused to hear what lower-working class women I know want. You are wrong—that is all I have heard and I'm sick of it. Mothers have been systematically shut out of Sparky and any community dealings with motherhood. ""Those women don't have time to come to meetings and anyway they'd freak out. They shouldn't be here."" I want non-mothers to quit making decisions for mothers. The working-lower class non-mothers involved in Sparky fuck me over just as much as middle class non-mothers with their childless options. Which brings me to the point about who should have control over major decisions at Sparky.

I want to point out that we do not live in a revolutionary society. Almost every child at Sparky goes home to her mother every night and ten years from now that's where that child will still be. How childless women who have no concept of what childcare involves can presume to make decisions that affect those mothers is beyond me. And everything that happens in that center affects those mothers' lives—it doesn't work out that what happens in daycare and what happens at home are two separate entities. There are all kinds of carryovers from one to the other. At this point, mothers have no reason to trust non-mothers no matter how much childcare that non-mother has done. First, the childcare that non-mothers do is so minimal and on top of that it is pretty damn atrocious. I don't know any non-mother who does childcare that doesn't do things to or with the children involved that doesn't increase the burden on the mother when the child returns. Of course, childless persons can afford to do this since they don't have to deal with the mess later (i.e., not giving children naps who need them, feeding them crap instead of balanced food, being careless with safety measures). Then there are the guilt trips laid on mothers by non-mothers. Childless persons who do childcare never have to deal with that—and they are often the ones who lay on the guilt. I could go on and on about why mothers have no reason to trust you.

It is misleading for childless persons who do childcare to call themselves non-biological mothers—the implication is that although biologically you are not mothers, in practice you are. You never will be because you'll never have to experience what mothers must—nor do I think you should have to—but non-biological mother implies that the person has struggled with her oppressiveness and come to a realization of what a mother's oppression is. No childless woman in this community has struggled. Childless women are reinforcing each other's oppressiveness and fuck-ups. You are defining how you oppress mothers and not listening to what mothers say. When you do struggle and mothers have reason to trust you, then control of major decisions should be yours too. But it is up to the mothers to define when that oppression has stopped. It's a long way off as far as I can see.

You have consistently ignored my motherhood in your criticisms. You talk rather glibly about my ""hustling supports from middle class women."" You can't see that my life and needs are not the same as yours precisely because of my motherhood. I am in the rather uncomfortable position of having to choose between: 1) living/dealing with lower-working class mothers and being oppressed because of my gayness and politics, 2) living/dealing with lower-working class, feminist, gay non-mothers and being oppressed because of my motherhood, 3) living/dealing with middle class mothers and being oppressed because of my class, or 4) living alone. Obviously, number one is out for several reasons (it is near impossible to live with only mothers with no help from non-mothers), two is out because I have yet to find a childless person of any class who wants to deal with children. Mothers already burdened with childcare are always the first and often the only ones to help out with children. I will never live alone with a child again if I can help it. The only alternative that has worked out in my life is living with a middle class mother and another woman who is middle class and dealing with childcare. It's not so easy as a pick and choose situation—when you have children it leaves you no room to be fussy. You must take what you can get. You cannot even see through to my oppression as a mother.

You can choose to ignore my needs and the needs of all mothers. And the structure is such in this community (as well as in society at large) that mothers have no power—because you have all the options to pull out anytime you wish. Mothers can do nothing without childcare. You talk about the money from our collective coming out of bounty with strings attached. Don't forget the threat you hold over every mother's head because of the bounty of energy that comes from your being childless and that you can put or not put into childcare as you choose. Mothers haven't forgotten it—it's been used on them too much.

One more thing—I'm sick of non-mothers telling me how I should think. ""The reason she wants this or that is because she still wants control over the child. After all, she's a mother and mothers are possessive. Not that they don't have reasons to be possessive..., etc."" If I say I don't feel like that you say or assume I'm lying and don't want to admit how I really feel. I can't have a valid reason for anything—I'm a mother. What it comes down to is my real reasons don't fit your plans.

As I was putting this together, it occurred to me this is a waste of time because everyone always says, ""Well, she's not talking about me. I'm struggling really hard. How can she say that?""

I want to make it clear that I do mean you—no exceptions exist in this community.

I think of material resources. It's especially when resources are low that you must serve yourself first. When you talk about correctly serving working-class mothers I assume you are talking about your own needs. That's what I mean about serving yourself first.

#4 Saying you're sick of hearing from other working and lower class women who have been making criticisms about class and homophobia is a drag. Homophobia has been making me sick all my life. Speaking about this community alone, I am sure that in 10 or 15 years queers will be oppressed in the same ways that children will go home from daycare to their mothers. In 10 or 15 years we're liable to have 24-hour daycare and mothers will be able to go on to something else, like choosing to be gay when it's convenient and choosing not to exercise a gay consciousness when it's not convenient.

#5 Heterosexual mothers and gay mothers know nothing about what affects my life and they don't much care unless, as Mary said, it is affecting or will affect the quality of the childcare they're getting. It would be nice not to make any decisions that affected mothers. It would probably be nice if mothers didn't make any decisions that affected my life. Since that's not the reality, the decisions at Sparky must be joint. Mothers, by the way, have not been ""systematically excluded"" from Sparky. There were mothers at every meeting, more at the most recent meeting than at any other. If your comment comes out of paranoia you might notice that the lesbians keep expecting to be thrown out, etc. as in the past. That is another reason for joint decisions. Trust cuts both ways.

It is not clear to me if you mean the Sparky care is minimal and atrocious. I don't think the specifics you gave are true of Sparky. There have been public struggles over mistakes and disagreements, but I wish you would clarify because it is a very serious charge. The a.m. naps (when I am there) are regular."

the children eat better than many of us ate when we were children,  
and people are systematically making repairs and watching for main-  
tenance and play hazards.  

I do not know, because I don't have to experience it, the  
quality of motherhood guilt trips, but lesbians do indeed know  
about guilt and it doesn't begin when you bear a child. It is  
precisely this kind of failure of analysts out of which comes the  
rhetoric of the-absolutely-oppressed that I think results in the  
kind of tit for tat some of us (including me) have been into.  

I think it comes out of anger and panic. Frankly, I'm not so  
hot at analysis, but I've been forced to try it in order to get  
straight what it is correct for me to do and what it is correct  
for me to demand.  

#6 I agree with you about the name Non-biological mother, for  
the reasons you gave and for others.  

There is no way I am interested in winning the trust of  
heterosexual women or newly gay mothers who are trying to fuck me  
over. The MOTHERS' MANIFESTO talks about being forced to pass  
at welfare. We're all forced to pass at times. Try it without  
a child. And what if we left it to lesbians to decide when mothers  
oppressiveness stopped...I think this again is part of a failure  
of analysis, a failure to see that you and all mothers are oppressors  
as well as oppressed.  

#7 You are right I have ignored your motherhood because I will  
not let you beat me over the head with it. You have ignored my  
oppression and the oppression of others for the same reason. When  
I talk about struggle, I'm talking about getting past this point,  
not doing childcare that you think is adequate.  

I feel pretty sure I did not use the expression 'hustle supports’  
guiltily because I was also speaking about myself. However trying  
to gap bridges when we're still screaming at each other was a mis-  
take and I'm sorry about it.  

#8 You are right I can choose to ignore your needs and the needs  
of all mothers and what I struggle with is why, under the circum-  
stances of my life, and the fact that you are choosing to  
ignore my needs, why I'm not perfectly justified to do so and fuck  
correct political analysis.  

You compare the structure of this community of 25 or so lesbians  
with the society at large! That is a failure of analysis so of-  
fensive that I don't know where to bite. You say 'mothers have no  
power—you have all the options to pull out’. Even granting that  

I have the single option to pull out, power is material. Allowing  
that we're talking about the realms all women are permitted, mot-  
hers have the power of institutionalized heterosexuality that  
enabled a handful of mothers to convince a lesbian community that  
childcare was their responsibility and then get those lesbians to  
go around saying that mothers are outnumbered and mothers are  
powerless. It is also institutional heterosexuality that controls  
the ease with which I can handle my economic life and the safety  
with which I can live my public and private life. A spin-off is  
getting your head bent.  

What you say about the 'bounty of energy that comes from being  
childless' would be funny if it weren't so serious to both of us.  
Like I said in the beginning my energy goes back into—or should  
be going into—being queer and trying to survive decently in a  
society that I have to re-create every day and which I can expect  
to have to re-create for the rest of my life. It may be correct  
for me to assume childcare responsibilities but not at the ex-  
pense of the life I've been trying to live in peace for 30 years.  
Yeah, the number of years is real important for me. It's divisive,  
and tangential and blots out the issues etc. so is being queer  
forever.  

#9 That is why I'm sick of straight women and gay mothers without  
a gay consciousness trying to force me into their world. They  
have been doing it all my life.  

Your demands, the demands of all mothers are perfectly legiti-  
mate, but don't expect me to do your bidding. You fucked me over  
before you had children and you're fucking me over now. Count on  
heterosexual women, and heterosexual identified women not to even  
notice your existence unless it's to get something off you or to  
victimize the way you live. My needs come first for me and it  
pisses me off to see the political lesbian community acting on be-  
half of straight women's needs. You're damn right I do childcare  
because it suits me. Because I'm willing to create space for Teri  
to grow in. Because the pressure I've felt from the community is  
a correct tool and being there was the correct way to struggle.  
Because if I didn't work where the community was working I would be  
isolated all over again from even the crumbs of a lesbian sub-  
culture. What are lesbians doing in institutional childcare?  
Another failure of analysis, another impasse, more pig-headedness  
from both of us. I know you mean me in your last paragraph and  
now you know I mean you and where do we go from here?"

A child I know told an adult that she was going to “bite her  
all over."" The adult later smiled at the image of hoards of child-  
ren attacking adults biting them all over their bodies. This idea  
is amazingly similar to the actions of women, united against their  
oppressors, during the Chinese revolution. I do not think the  
comparison should be taken lightly.  

Children have little or no control over money, transportation,  
their living situation, their time or energy, even their anger is  
laughed at, ignored or beat out of them. A child says something  
that is perfectly serious and is laughed at for being cute, then  
catching on, she or he tries to do it again for a laugh and is  
rebuffed. Adults talk about children as though they were little  
animals who aren't quietly hearing every word. And women who  
would like to bash in the face of men who call them chicks (baby  
chickens) continue referring to children as kids (baby goats), and  
on and on.  

Being unable to physically survive alone, children are totally  
subject to the adults that take care of them. This dependency  
falls largely on mothers who are fed large doses of mystification  
and guilt (along with who knows what else) to get them into their  
roles and keep them there in order to provide the necessary labor.  
At the same time a mother and child begin to know each other and  
special feelings build up like with a person you've been friends  
with since grade school. Generally, though, the mother has total  
responsibility for and control of the child. The mother is  
oppressed by the institution of motherhood which takes so much  
time and energy that she begins to lose herself, becoming ""Mary's  
mother"" and frequently someone's wife as well, but never a person  
in her own right. In anger and frustration she hits, pleads,  
screams, and punishes the child so she or he will be good enough  
to be worth the mother's life, and also so that the child will  
leave her alone, get off her back. The child responds to this  
overt oppression by trying to ""be good"" though she or he can  
never quite make it, by anger/screaming, crying, fighting, and by  
sneaking around to get what she or he wants. Children usually  
learn pretty fast how much or how little power they actually  
have, when to shuffle, how to get by and do the best they can, etc.  

Children are oppressed by adults and at the same time are  
used as instruments for the oppression of mothers. What should  
be a very nice friendship turns into a complicated love/hate mess.  

Many adults are beginning to relate to their passive oppres-  
sion of mothers in allowing this to happen and are doing child-  
care as one approach to changing the institution which oppresses  
mothers (and by association all women). And they are now being  
confronted with their oppression of children. Some women freak  
out when they realize that they are doing to children what has  
been done to them, they are the enemy too. Others simply dig  
in and begin to try to change things. All make mistakes.  

The first reaction is usually total permissiveness, a des-  
perate illogical fear of doing something oppressive leads to  
allowing and sometimes even encouraging children to pick up adults'  
worst habits. Children are allowed to smoke and drink beer  
(children have small livers which can't deal with these things  
very well), regulate all their own sleeping and eating habits,  
and destroy everything in sight. Coughing, sickly, grouchy,  
obnoxious tyrants begin making enormous demands on shocked adults  
who forget that children don't have all the information and exper-  
ience necessary to make many decisions, and they sometimes go  

Vl, I no, 2 and 3  

\WE MUST  

LISTEN TO  
CHILDREN’  

wild with power totally unconcerned with other people.  

The state many adults seem to be in now may be a reaction  
to this or may simply be another approach but it seems to be a  
pretty widespread situation. Having total control, many adults  
now seem to be struggling with the problem of the oppression  
of children with a different form of adult chauvinism: the child  
as a political experiment rather than a person, with the adult  
political ideology imposed on the child, not by example but by  
force: emotional and/or physical. Girls, for example, should not  
wear dresses, sounds familiar in reverse. With male children this  
sort of thing is just as devastating. The female is told it's  
good to be tough and strong and to fight for her rights “don't  
be wimpy"". He, in the next sentence, is told to be wimpy, be  
passive, wear dresses, be quiet and submissive. If she hits him  
she's applauded, if he pushes her down he's a bully. But all of  
this totally disregards two real people struggling to live togeth-  
er: fairness is often neglected in favor of a political abstrac-  
tion.  

School and television and the whole rest of the world is  
telling the male to be macho and the female to be wimpy, but  
just telling them and trying to enforce the opposite isn't  
working. She wants people to know she's a girl, she's proud of  
being female. And people rebel against being taught to be weak  
so he's lost, ignored if he's passive, rejected if he's aggressive.  
Those are the only two alternatives that we have so far been able  
to give them.  

Children don't seem to identify with our ideals, they iden-  
tify with us. They don't have all the information necessary to  
sort out the good from the bad. A friend of mine who is almost  
four years old lives with people who don't smoke. One night  
I noticed that she was picking up my cigarette butts and trying  
to smoke them, all the time I was explaining how smoking is bad  
for you. Adults need to be giving fewer criticisms to children  
and more to themselves—and each other.  

It seems necessary that all children be given love and re-  
spect and space to grow equal to their repression as a severely  
oppressed class of people. With male children this is amazingly  
difficult, perhaps because there are so many privileges attached  
to traditional male behavior and so few men who are decent models.  
For male children living within a gay women's community this can  
become especially difficult. If a male child constantly hears  
that all males are hated he will learn not only to hate himself  
but also the people who taught him. If he is constantly rejected  
simply for being male he will see no reason to struggle, or to  
try to be different. There are a few adult males who have shown  
by virtue of consistently assuming responsibility for children  
over extended periods of time that they are sincere. It seems  
that we must begin to judge their efforts with the same degree of  
trust that we hope for from children and other people that we our-  
selves oppress, putting faith in actions rather than words. Male  
children sometimes choose to relate to male adults and feel it is  
unfair that they live with all women and no men. To a gay mother  
this is a frightening problem. A child is not loved more or less  
by a mother because of what sex she or he is but simply as a  
special person with unique needs. Those needs for male children  
are often not met by other gay women except in the most limited  
ways and with some resentment, not liking, for example to be  
touched by male children but enjoying being touched by female  
children. But it seems that we teach children their roles by  
treating them differently rather than treating them as individuals  
within an oppressed class.  

It seems that we must begin to deal with our oppressiveness  
in the ways we've learned and been taught to analyze our oppres-  
sion. We must listen to children. It was a child who told me  
that he didn't like being called a kid, he only told me once. A  
screaming child is trying to say something, we must listen to  
children's anger; not demand explanations when we're criticized;  
try to share our privileges equally with children; remember that  
with children too the inability to articulate does not mean an  
inability to think or to hear and understand. We should allow  
children to spend time alone with each other, safe from eaves-  
dropping adults (although their physical safety must be consider-  
ed too); and encourage and support their unity with each other  
in struggling with their oppressors.  

With these sorts of cross references we can begin to deal  
with such everyday situations as the similarity of an adult  
ripping off a record and a child sneaking a forbidden toy. Child-  
ren cannot write down their feelings to help each other understand  
and unite against their oppression. They are totally at our  
mercy. It seems that learning to use power fairly is something  
never taught in this society, something that women are struggling  
hard to teach themselves. With children this necessity for fair-  
ness is urgent because they learn our oppressiveness as they  
suffer from it. We cannot afford to be any more liberal or less  
critical with ourselves than we are with people we consider to be  

our enemies.

A REPLY TO THE ARTICLE BY A
MIDDLE-CLASS MOTHER WHOSE
AGE AND SITUATION MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANYBODY

I'm a fourteen-year-old working-class dyke, and I hate day-
care. That's how I've always felt about it and I always fucked it
off until just a few months ago when I moved into a community
where the daycare issue was real heavy. I started doing daycare
only because I knew that if I didn't do daycare I would get shit
from every woman in the community.

It took me about a month before I started realizing my res-
ponsibilities towards other working-class women, especially the
gay feminist working-class women in my community, but I still
hate daycare.

When I do daycare, I try to look happy about it and try to
think up things for the kids to do. You might say that is hypo-
critical of me and that I should be honest with the kids. Being
honest with kids is important, but what are you supposed to say?
I hate watching you? I suppose I don't hate kidcare, period, but
doing it for 10 or 15 kids at one time with only one other vol-
unteer can really be a drag sometimes. I really think it's fucked
up to hate daycare, but watching one kid at a time is easier for
me, and more enjoyable. But I am committed to struggling and want
to get into daycare more.
I try to look at the bright side of things, like I live in a
fairly small city, and there's not a whole lot to do, and it takes

want kids, am offended by their heterosexual practices and com-
mitments.

What I want to see is free daycare everywhere for women and
their kids. Like, my mother has to take her youngest kid (out of
six) to work with her every day from early in the morning until
late at night which isn’t fair to her or him. And she has it
pretty good, because she works in a place where she can depend on
others to help her, and she won't lose her job. In most cases it’s
no job or high babysitting rates.

I think it's real important and necessary for women to be
confronted about the daycare issue because that's the only way
that anything is going to happen with daycare. That was the case
with me and others in this community. Where I grew up there wasn't
any free daycare, or anything near free. My mother shelled out
eighty bucks a month for my little brother alone. That's not
counting all the money she dished out for the rest of her six kids.
Or for the food she bought, or for the clothes she bought, or for
her own labor! Skilled workers get paid for the labor they put out
besides charges for parts, etc... and if my mother had been paid
for her 19 years of labor she would be set. Instead she got SET
six times.

When I grew up I hated babysitters and school because it
meant being around perfect strangers. I understand how kids get
freaked out about being around strange people that change several
times a day, and I think it's good for kids to relate to a group
of women, and bad to be dependent on one, like a mother. They
should be able to relate freely and not be controlled by the
mother.

We women are still the ones responsible for daycare, and
that's real shit, but if I had a kid I wouldn't want a male to be
caring for her because at this time there isn't one single male
who I think is responsible enough to not fuck her head up and give
her any bullshit lines. I'm not trying to hide the real world from
kids, but we're all around these fucked up people enough and when
kids go to public school they're going to get enough bullshit and
enough lines to last them till eternity. And also they need a pol-
itical consciousness, too, and they should get it early. They'll
need it to fight off the crap that'll be coming down on them. I
want kids to be struggling to become fighters for liberation. Kids
are sick of taking shit and pretty soon if we get our shit toget-
her it's gonna come tumbling down and people better realize it
fast. I have this vision of a revolutionary class of kids and
blacks and dykes and mothers and everybody that's gonna be TOOOOO
MUCH!

And I don't want to hear anybody who's not a kid, even oppre-
ssed mothers, tell about my oppression. I can’t get jobs, I can't
go to bars, I can’t even hitchhike, I can't drive. I’m controlled
by the snap of a finger, a signature on a paper, and the point of
a gun. And that's only a PART of my oppression. Not one word in
the ""adult"" article on children's oppression speaks of MY opp-
ression, as a 14-year-old dyke, trying to live independently. Any
adult who wants to write about kid's oppression better come to the
kids to find out, and we want every bit of the royalties, sweetie.
And I won't talk to men who come around, I'm a child, honey, and
I'm a WOMAN. AND I GET OFF ON IT!

Right now daycare is really important to me, but I still hate

up a lot of my time. And there's usually some neat women volunteers the actual work, which is unfortunate because that's what we need

around to talk to.

now. THE END.

...it is hard to face things like being

Pregnant by yourself.

Finding out you are pregnant when you
are not married is one of the most fright-
ening experiences a girl could ever go
through.

I am an unwed mother. My son is one
year of age now and I would like to express
to the readers some of my feelings throughout pregnancy.

I was 16 when I got pregnant and I had
no real parents to turn to. I went from
foster homes to other ones. The father of
my child wanted to get married but my fear
of divorce pretty much set us on two sepa-
rate paths.

I never had the problem of telling my
parents as I have already explained. But
I had sisters to tell and to me it was a
very hard thing to do. Mainly because I
had no idea how they would feel towards
me (although that really made no differ-
ence). But it is hard to face things like
being pregnant by yourself.

Throughout my pregnancy I had people
telling me to give my baby up. He would
have a better home. He would have both
parents and that I couldn't take on that
much responsibility by myself. I also had
people telling me to keep my baby. He was
my own and it would hurt me mentally if
I were to give him up.

Having all these suggestions being
pushed on you at this point is very hard
on a person.

I lived in a house with a family while
I was pregnant as I had no money. I helped
clean house and that paid for my room and
board. I ended up getting well attached
to the family and they pretty well helped
me make my decision.

The thoughts that so often entered my
head during this time were -- could I
handle the responsibility of a baby? Would
I be put down by people? Could I love my
baby without feeling a resentment toward
him because I would be more tied down?

Illegitimate children are pretty well
accepted in today's society but there are
still a few people who frown on me. Who
think I am taking on too much. Not too
many people, but those who do really don't

February [173

know me or my son.

We are both happy and I have never re-
gretted keeping him. There are times when
kids get on your nerves and I go through
those times just as every other parent
does. But that is to be expected. Kids
won't ever change -- I'm sure I did the
same when I was small.

It costs me more to live, keeping my
son, but I realized it would before I ever
gave birth to him.

I feel that if more girls were given the
choice to keep their babies or give them
up without being pushed one way or the
other -- whether they are married or not --
things would work better for the girl as
well as the baby -- because she would have
made her own decision and therefore would
not have such a resentment towards her de-
cision.

I am very happy at my decision even if
I still am considered young. Age really
doesn't matter. It's how much love you have
to offer and I feel I have more than
enough for my son."

\2 ae 2 the eg ol YY iw’ =,  

a black mother talks  

about daycare:  

Q: You were around when free daycare got started in Iowa City,  
right? I wasn't into that. Could you tell me how you heard  
about it and how you felt about it?  

A: It's hard to start out with just the free daycare movement.  

The free daycare movement seemed to come out of the other one,  

the movement with University preschools and with cooperative day-  
care, where you could give 8 hours a week and then it's free,  
otherwise it's pro-rated: the amount of money that you paid being  
according to the amount of time that you could put in. It was like  
the national movement of daycare centers, with fairly middle class  
and university women doing a daycare thing, so I guess my first  
impression is like I had of the whole movement -- it was only in-  
clusive for people like those people that started it. It didn't go  
outside the immediate group.  

Q: Could you explain in what ways you are not part of that,  
what your situation is?  

A: My situation is different in a way. Well, I am a student. I  
wasn't always a student, so in the past when daycare started I was  
not only a black woman and an unmarried woman but I was on welfare.  
That gave us a total dichotomy between myself and the people who  
ran and populated daycare centers. So, while I am a student right  
now, that's a real unimportant part of describing me. So I guess I  
would still have a major difference from the rest in being from a  
whole different background and situation from white middle class  
student women.  

Q: So they got theirs started. Did they make any overtures to  
you to get into it or anything? Or did you just know about it?  
A: Well, being black in a white university community, you do  
have a sort of pull from the more radical elements to get in-  
volved. So I was approached by the university people to partici-  
pate, and I'm sure other black women with children here have been  
wooed to participate. Mostly without success because black wo-  
men are not real hipped up on letting highly ""political"" types  
take care of their children.  

Q: So there was this dichotomy between you and the ""hip"" univer-  
sity community who were getting this together. And so they told  
you about it? Did they come and say, 'Do you want to do this?'  
or did you kinda just cool it from that or what?  

A: I guess the first people aren't the same people that we would  
be talking about if we talked about the existing Sparky community  
or something like that, because the first group of people -- ad  
hoc committees for dealing with children -- were some of the peo-  
ple who are outside the community that we talk about; but they  
were middle class women, and some of them were married and had  
black children, and I guess that's what the immediate negative  
reaction that came from single black women on campus was dealing  
with -- these people that had black children that were white, because  
it was real hard for black women to trust their kids to people  
that would take a child knowing that they couldn't give them the  
kind of future that they need, the kind of identity and everything,  
and so you aren't going to give your own kids to them to do the  
same things they're going to do to the black kids they adopted.  

So in the very beginning, back in '67, those kinds of people were  
involved in trying to set up daycare. They weren't real success-  
ful but those were the first people that approached black women.  

Q: Would you like to run down your politics about how you feel  
about that?  

A: Well, it's just that, you know, we haven't gotten to the point  
where we're all people yet. I mean, that's ridiculous. That's just  
real superfluous to talk about it even -- White middle class people,  
and even upper class, especially around here, they are professors  
and so start to leave the middle class with those kinds of salar-  
ies. But any white person hard as you might try, it's hard to fig-  
ure out what it's like to be black, and all the empathy in the  
world isn't what you need. And this child grows up and they need  
more blackness than the child in the ghetto because the child in  
the ghetto does at least see other black people. This child is  
going to grow up knowing that everything he sees good in the whole  
world is white and then there's nothing that the parent can tell  
him that's going to change that, because children see what we do  
and how we act and not what we say. So tell them that black people  
are really worthwhile and they don't even see any, you know, it  
just doesn't settle right in their stomachs. It'd be like in the  
early '60s when they said the talk about equality without doing  
anything about it, when you could tell a child that the child next  
to him was equal yet that child couldn't go into the same restau-  
rants or couldn't go to the same schools, had to go to inferior  
everything, I mean to that child the words were meaningless. And  
that's the same thing that happens to black kids that grow up in  
white families is that you can't say enough to take the place of  
what's actually going on in his life -- that he was saved from  
being in an institution by a wonderful white family that sends him  

page 24  

volume 3 numbers 2+3  

an  
interview  

to wonderful white schools to sit by nice little pretty white  
children, and then that parent is going to make some effort to say,  
you know, your difference shouldn't matter -- that right there is  
negative. It's saying even though you're not the same as us you can  
strive to be like us. The whole thing is real messed up. We haven't  
gotten to the point yet that people can take cross-cultural things  
like that. I don't think that's always the case; but it's the case  
when a person from a majority society is taking a minority child.  

I say that there's a difference because if a white child grew up in  
a black family, no matter what he lives in America, and there's  
nothing in the world like being white in America, and nothing you  
could do at home would take the place of what goes on outside in  
the world. He knows he's worthwhile 'cause he goes to school, and  
he sees the president looks just like him, v.p., and the whole damn  
senate, and there's nothing that that black family at home could  
tell that child that that whole world wouldn't erase, so you know,  
it wouldn't be the same always cross-culturally, but it definitely  
is when the child comes from a minority culture.  

Q: So those daycare centers because they were staffed by whites  
were no different from putting your child into a white family?  

A: Right. Definitely. Any daycare center staffed by white people  
would be like putting them in a white family. They cannot meet the  
needs of that child no matter how many of them there are and I see  
that even putting him in a daycare center -- another angle is that  
people ask you to bring your black child so that the white kids can  
get used to being around black children, and I think that's a real  
bunch of shit, because it's like your child isn't really a real  
person, it's a doll, you buy it for the kids to play with.  

Q: Did that actually happen? Can you describe?  

A: Oh, yes. We can start out with welfare. When I started out with  
welfare here in Iowa City, they have their own daycare centers -- well  
people -- you couldn't call them daycare centers -- babysitter centers,  
where one woman or two women takes care of a group of children from  
welfare families, and the welfare pays her. And they approached me  
because I was talking about going back to school, so that I'd have  
child care that wouldn't cost me, and the person that was sitting  
for me then, they couldn't certify her for various reasons, and the  
people that they took me to always came up with the fact that they  
thought it'd be good for the other kids to be around the little black  
child. Or if they were hesitant, they weren't sure what the other  
kids would think having a black child. It was always negative.  

They always came up with they were always happy to have him, but it  
was for the sake of the other children. This was something new and  
it'd be real fun for them. I think that’s real detrimental to  
children to be treated like they're a nonentity, and their only  
worth is in the goodness that they can bring to other people's  
lives. If you decide to do that for yourself that's one thing, but  
for other people to decide that for you, it's real strange. That's  
the way it was with the first Dum Dum and up and down Melrose Ave  
with the preschools. The attitude they took...  

Q: (Interrupting) This was supposedly from the feminist or women's  
community?  

A: Especially the further down Melrose you got like when it got  
down to Dum Dum. They were more radical than, say, Melrose Pre-  
school -- commercially run and has no pretenses to being cooperative.  
I had classes by then with people that worked at them. They were  
teaching assistants and research assistants that had talked to me  
in classes about bringing my child to daycare. Some of the people  
from that center did talk to me and said they thought it'd be good  
to have a black child in there -- the other kids, they could learn  
equality and I don't know what else they were supposed to learn.  

Q: And they'd see to it that the black child learned his lesson  
subtly. (Laughing)  

A: (Laughing) Yeah, that he was there for the service of mankind  
and not there for his own... you know, he had nothing to do with  
himself being there. He was there to be played with. Which is, I  
don't know, real strange. In those terms they would be totally  
abhorred and that's not what they had in mind. “How do our children  
learn if they're not around them?"" They learn to be racist without  
being around them, so I imagine they could probably teach 'em other  
things, too.  

Q: You're part of the community of women, made up of gay women in  
town who have for political reasons broken with those other daycare  
centers and formed another one, and yet we're still this white day-  
care center. Can you talk about how you feel about that?  

A: Well, I mean that's true, it is a white daycare center so I  
think that on a personal level -- while myself and other women that  
I know that have talked about daycare and the people that run that  
daycare center, you know, we can deal with them on a personal and  
adult level because at this point we pretty much know where we're  
at as third world women. There isn't a lot of harm that can be done."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page024.txt,AintIAWoman,,24,"to our psyches by them. And if I and my other friends felt it hap-

pening we'd leave; I mean, we know the difference. A child would
not. He'd be subjected to that and if we weren't around we would
not know what was happening to him in that center. People can't
help being white and being the kind of people they are. I'm not
saying that people are just mean and like driving black children
nuts, but the job gets done and intentions aren't nearly as import-
ant as the effect they're having on the children. And to have that
many--especially that place where you have 15 adults around a lot--
that many white people supervising black children--I think it'd be
bad. It's bad enough black children end up inevitably having to go
to school and having white teachers and start to get that later. I
guess we can put it off as long as we can--having white supervision.
Hopefully, we can send 'em to a school where they have black instruc-
tors but I don't think we can do that in Iowa City or even in the
state of Iowa. There are very few black instructors here. So the
possibility that you can do a lot for the child yourself before they
get to school is one out. You inevitably run into that authority
thing with white people but hopefully, by then, the child will have
some background about himself and about what to expect going to
school--things you couldn't warn 'em about when they go to daycare
at 2 or 3 years old. I guess the only relationship I can see with

white daycare centers dealing with third world children is that
it's likened to--and we can learn things from different systems--
dealing with black economic development where white people have all

the money and all black people have is human resources, you know,
and the ability, of course, to deal with each other that white
people don't have. White people can offer facilities and--when pos-
sible--financial arrangements. But most of the things they can of-
fer is usually never in the contact stage, where they come in dir-
ect contact with those people because that's just a hassle, you
know, white people haven't gotten to the point where they can deal
with black children or black people on a monetary basis without be-
coming very discriminating, and--especially monetarily--very rac-
ist. So the only thing that daycare centers that are white can
offer is space and offer some expertise--if there is any--how to
finance daycare centers, how to build them, how to apply for feder-
al funds. As far as populating the daycare center, in a position of
authority, I don't think that that should happen at all.

Q: Is there any black daycare at all in Iowa City?

A: No. They were talking about it. There is a group called

EBONY SISTERHOOD in Iowa City, of which I'm not a part 'cause
they're married. But they're talking about black daycare and
setting up something, perhaps. I'm not even sure how far they've
gone, even if they've left. Des Moines has a couple and they may
have gone down there to see how they run it (if they haven't they
should) but that's in the planning stage. Heretofore there haven't
been any black children at any age level enough to deal with it.
The transient population--here two to four years at the most--at
the time--there weren't more than 5 or 6 at any age. It's real
hard to set up a daycare center for two or three children. And the
other children who've been here forever have always participated in
staying home with their mother. (laughing) As far as black stud-
ents, other students with children, either the wife was at home or
they were both students and they would have to have a sitter be-
cause, you know, there was nothing they felt any confidence in.
With the black student population growing, I think the need for a
daycare center is becoming imminent. And they'll deal with it, but
before there hasn't been more than 10, I think, at one time, you
know, black children belonging to university students in any one
age group. So there've been very few babies around for people to
deal with. They were all either babies of a year or less or else
they were children in school.

a woman?

February 1973

Q: Do you have any feelings, being working class yourself, about
the supposed policies of Sparky to serve or give preference to
working class people? Sparky is not run by only middle class
people; there are a lot of working class people in it but I don't
know if you've ever heard anyone--like Sarah--talk about how she
was really offended when the idea came up of just serving working
class people. She thought that idea came just out of middle class
guilt and she thought that that was sort of messed up. Do you have
any feelings about that? Race may come into it so much that it may
make it an invalid question.

A: I guess to start off with I should make a statement about the
whole middle class guilt thing. It doesn't bother me so much that
middle class people feel guilty if that's not the level they stay
on. If we don’t get anything done because we think that it's
middle class guilt--that's where we get our money and that’s where
we get some ability to gather some knowledge so we can get rid of
'em. The thing is, if you're going to get as bogged down about
their guilt as they are, then, what the hell? They're bogged

down in being guilty and you don't want 'em to come over 'cause
they're guilty. You don't have no power! And that's one of the
major problems with working class and lower class people: they
don't have no power. And middle class people have some. They
don't have as much as the upper class people, but they have some
power, you know. If we could get all the power, that'd be great.
But I don't think that should stand in the way of working class
people being able to use middle class people to get the things
that they want. You don't have to stand around and hold their
hand because they're busy wanting to be flagellated because
they're guilty. The fact that they're usually very weak by the
time they get to that stage--you can channel their energies into
something useful. If they're going to stand around being guilty,
that takes up a lot of space. And the thing is, if they got
nothing better to do, then find something for them to do.

Q: So, like a daycare center would be finding something for

them to do...

A: The thing is that middle class people with little money can
volunteer their time. Working class people can't. They're gonna
starve if they don't work. So you can't say, ""We don't want them
around 'cause they're guilty, we'll go off and start our own day-
care center."" The problem is, without any money working class peo-
ple can't do that 'cause they can't spare the time to sit around all
day watching their kids. They might as well be home if they're
going to watch their kids. And they could do that at home and
watch T.V. The thing is: you've gotta be able to use the re-
sources that are available. And, if you have to--just speaking
on a total level of white people: upper, middle, and lower class,
not coming in with a racial thing but just as a class thing--the
only thing the lower class has that it can use is manipulation.
And they've got to be able to manipulate those other classes to
get power, to get money, so they can survive. It's not just getting
money so you can count on it, but getting money so you can eat;
getting your fair share of the pie and the Gross National Product
that everyone's so proud of and that lower class people are getting
none of and making all of for those big people. If I could get some
rich person's money I'd feel good; I wouldn't turn my back and walk
away 'cause he was rich. Being poor, no matter what anybody says, I
don't think is very much fun. I see nothing to smile about when
you're hungry. Lower class people with children don't like to see
their kids go hungry, don't like to see every Christmas go by with
their children having nothing, and their days in school start
with nothing. That may look like a lot of fun and virtuous to
people who are middle class and are poor because they feel like
being it for 4 years in school. Turning your back on people be-
cause they're middle class is a real luxury in itself. It says
something about where your head is and that's just not where most
working class people are that are really working class. Because,
if you can manipulate those people, by God, do it. I think that
starting daycare centers and getting money from middle class
people and being able to use them, and if you're going to use

them in your daycare center and you don't like their politics,
get rid of the ones that you can, but talk to those other ones.
You should be able to tell 'em exactly what you want 'em to do

and let 'em do it, because if you're really working class--that's
it, you're off working--you're not sitting at a daycare center.
By all means, don't just say, ""because they're there I'll let 'em
run my kids crazy because they're middle class."" Manipulate 'em,
talk to 'em; there's an education level. Tell 'em exactly what
you want 'em to do with the kids, what you don't want 'em to do
and then, if they don't like that, fine. I think you should have
something to say over how they deal with your kids. They should
not have anything to say over how the money's spent. Use their
expertise, if they know something you don't. Working class people
and lower class people don't have resources because it's been kept
away from them. To throw away a chance at a resource, I think is
pretty foolhardy.

Gladys pissed her pants so she could have
a different change of clothes.

You of,

Max the Gorilla lives in Sparky's Basement

child proof your home!

Every house or apartment should be safe for
kids - whether kids live there or not.

When I take kids someplace that's set up 
with only adults in mind, it means more work
for me - watching the kids closely and there
is no reason for endangering the life or
health of a child. 

SOME THOUGHTS TO KEEP IN MIND:

The twins suddenly started saying this in response to any request
even though their grandmothers live miles away and they see them
about twice a year.

Alice and Sam were fighting all the time, Alice is the daughter
of a feminist, gay woman and already has quite a consciousness.

A bunch of women here had a talent show
to raise money for Sparky. Lots of kids came
and ran around making noise which was
a hassle at times. I was in the wings
eyeing a winner across the way.
She was fidgeting, so Mary put her hands
over her mouth. After she quieted down and
Mary removed her hands, the twither kept
her own hands plastered across her face
with a bewildered expression that cracked
me up.

Teri and I were riding in the car, and she was asking me
a whole string of why questions, like she was always doing then.
I'd give an answer and she'd say, ""Why?"" Then I'd explain that, and
she'd say ""Why?"" again.

I was trying to be real patient,
but pretty soon I got exasperated and said, ""Teri, why do you
say WHY all the time?""
She looked at me with this proud look on
her face and said, ""I say why ALL DAY LONG!!!""

BIG PERSON: ""Why is the potty clogged?""
LITTLE MARY: ""Because Joe flushed his
underpants down it.""

Teri has been raised on health food, and isn't allowed
candy or coke or things that aren't good for her.

At a birthday party the other week she was gorging herself on
cake, popcorn, punch, and anything else she could get her
hands on.

One time I went upstairs and passed her sitting
alone on the landing stuffing popcorn into her mouth saying
over and over, ""Shit food! Shit food! Shit food!""

Don't keep cleaners and other poisonous 
stuff under the sink. Put all that stuff up
high, out of reach or locked up. 
Everyone knows they're supposed to keep
medicine out of kids' reach but often don't 
do it. Put a lock on your medicine cabinet. 
Put razor blades in there too.

Keep small dangerous items off the floor
that babies might put in their mouths.
Tape over wall sockets not being used.
Put electrical cords out of reach.

Take knobs off gas stoves.

Always turn handles of pans in so they
don't stick out past the edge of the stove.

She doesn't like Sam much, but it got to the point where we had to
cool some of the fighting between them.
Alice invented a game called 'ghost' where she'd walk around with Sam holding an
oversized plastic play hammer looking for ghosts.
Alice said, ""Sam, there's a ghost on your back.""
Then Alice said, ""Well, we'd better get
him."" He said, ""ohhh?""

What a con job!

Afterwards Gladys said, ""ok and I'll
Then looking at the space
...'Where's the potty?""

Jeffrey has chapped
because all his shirts
are too short and on the
other uptraws he dogs it.

""I DON'T WANT to go potty!""

I'm in love with Gladys which has nothing to do
with the price of beans especially if you don't know
her or her twin sister. They are three years old and
remind me of Groucho and Harpo Marx. They're real
funny and seem to be spoofing everybody. I walked
into daycare yesterday feeling pretty sick. I had
diarrhea. Teri said she had it too. She's three
and whines and cries a lot but is a tough little
woman in her own way. She said her diarrhea was
a drag which is what I tell her about her crying
and what she tells me in return about everything.

I tried to lay down on the couch but Gladys jumped
and crawled all over me saying, ""I eat diarrhea.""
Meanwhile Maria and Sidney (adults) were talking
about the women's talent show that was coming up.

All of a sudden Alice and Mary (2 four-year-olds)
closed the big wooden doors between the living room
and the hall and stairway that leads upstairs. Then
they opened them and began their own women's talent
show with Alice's quirky movie act full of punches and
strong movements and some theme centered around beat-
ing up a man, eating him and vomiting him up. Alice
and Mary did a lot of dancing and Gladys and Jane joined
in. They all fought the boys off their stage and made
them sit in the audience. It was great. Sam is four
and he freaked out about not being able to be in the
show. Joe is two and didn't really understand the dia-
lectics of what was happening but put on a baseball cap
and stalked away. I love those kids.

Put sharp knives up high.
For babies that crawl, put gates on
stairs or have some way of blocking them.

Don't leave water in a bathtub. Drain off.

Put locks on basement doors or any
doors leading to stairs.

Paint, turpentine and other ""basement
stuff"" that's poisonous should be put out
of reach even if you think kids won't be in
the basement.

Get rid of tablecloth type things that
can be pulled down. Heavy things fall on
kids that way."

The first issue contains readings from the Liberation News Service, The

Our purpose is two-fold. We are available to read anything the blind or illiterate are hassled with getting through conventional channels. We also hope to become a focus for an embryonic handicapped person's liberation movement.  

We need lots of publicity. The group of people we hope to reach is not presently part of any organization, so we must depend on readers of the underground press to turn their blind friends on to our service. We would appreciate a small continuing spot in your paper. We would be ecstatic with a free subscription and could perhaps work out an exchange.

Since we put out The Childcare Issue in February we've been
through a lot of changes. The situation regarding childcare has
changed considerably here and the childcare issue had repercussions
in this town that were threatening to people's safety and security.
We hope that in the next issue there will be more about childcare
and that we can deal with some of the changes this community has
been through.

This issue was originally to be one on violence and women. It
really isn't. After the childcare issue we were hesitant to put
out an issue solely about violence -- afraid of the repercussions
it could have for women in this town. We also received Jane Alpert's
article and felt that it and the responses to it warranted the space
it would take since anyone underground is so limited from normal
means of communication.

In between putting out the childcare issue and this issue, we
sent copies of a women's poetry anthology to our subscribers.
The anthology was published by a group of gay women and includes
poems read at the first and second All Women's Poetry Readings in

April 23, 1973
Dear Sisters,

I really enjoyed your childcare issue...
and found it somewhat fascinating that
nothing else could get done due to all of
the struggles over who's going to take
care of the children. I've had fantasies
myself of interrupting any and all meetings
in my area with mobs of children so that
nothing could get done until ""who's going
to take care of the children"" got dealt
with a little better. However, I no longer
(at this moment) feel quite like that is
the best approach for (where I live).

I'm getting off the track.

Here are some of my thoughts

ON CHILDCARE
What do we mean when we say as mothers
that we need help with caring for the
children? And I tell a two-year-old who is
visiting our house with his mother ""no,
you can't have that jar full of peanuts""

Iowa City. The same group of women have started a women's press.
We're excited about both the book and the press. If you didn't
get the anthology and would like one they are $1. The next issue
of AIAW we expect to print ourselves on the press. So it may take
some time but should be out this summer.

and take out a few to give to him...and
his mother rushes from the hall to his de-
fense and she takes over administering
what he can and can't have...not able to
trust that anybody but she can truly be
properly concerned for her child's welfare.

And why is it that when some children
are left with other people they totally
freak out and cry constantly. I don't
think that it is natural for babies to be
so attached to their mothers and I feel
that we (as mothers) are at least as re-
sponsible as other people that children
aren't more able to be raised collectively.
..actually I'm not trying to place blame...
but too often there is a cry by mothers
that nobody else sees what needs to be done
in order to care for their baby/child prop-
erly...there is a presumption by everyone
(including the mother) that mother knows
best and although she's found out everything
that she knows about what affects her child
(ie why she/he won't eat; why she/he's cry-
ing; etc) has been through trial and error...
still other people aren't allowed that same
process and instead if mother is around she
unconsciously acts as the all-knowing re-
garding ""her"" child.

It is hard to fight the privatization of
children. But first we are recognizing that
they are privatized...and then we are

struggling with changing that. I hope that
in your future issues you will have more
on ""who takes care of the children.""

I live in a flat with four adults and
three children. There are often as many as
six neighborhood children. And we have a
couple of overnight switching so that who

Kathy, pick up the gun

that your father used to kill
your mother.

It is yours.

It is your inheritance.

Take revenge on this putrid
patriarchal world.

Your mother's murder is part of
the world-wide woman genocide.

Your father is one of the everyday
murderers.

Seek revenge, Kathy.

Am I being followed?

What is that noise?

Planning my karate attacks.

If he's tall—kick him in the shins.

And do an elbow punch to his stomach.

If he's short—go for his eyes.

If he comes up behind me, smash his instep.

I hate it.

I hate it.

I hate the need to always be conscious of
my survival.

In my house.

Lock the doors.

Don't take a bath when no one else is home.

I try to ignore the cats which sound like
murders, rapists, intruders.
Watching kids—doubles, triples,
multiplies by thousands.
The caution.
The fear.
The need to protect.
What if something happened to one of them?
Can I really defend them and me?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
This constant fear.

And no one did.
Pure luck.

My fear of men is so deep-rooted.
So real.

Hundreds of men every day pass through the
cafeteria line.

And I think any one of these men

Could be a murderer.

The murderer of the student nurse who was
killed in her dorm room over spring
break.

Almost every one of these men

Is a personal threat to my life.

They hate women.

Want us destroyed.

They are so helpless and stupid.

""How do you get coffee?""

""Can I give you 3¢?""

""How does the creamer work?""

""I have the change""—and I know he hardly
ever does.

They spill things all the time.

And they take their inability to function

in this world

As a natural expected phenomenon.

They turn their inferiority into hatred.

Choose your weapons
And use your anger well.

Become a woman-loving woman. Newark and NYC.

I used to walk down the streets of

Brute obnoxiousness.
Slamming the money down.

Become strong and learn to resist: ""Alone; Throwing it all over
men, leading a quacking toy duck on a string."" When I told one of the men, half-smiling,
‘bela Ge he was a little slow in always having.

Men are too dangerous to be with
And women are too beautiful to
neglect.
Pick up that gun, Kathy
And help us blow their world
to pieces.

PARANOIA

a woman

Is the unavoidable

Almost always present paranoia.

Every day.

Every day watching

Keeping my sixth sense of woman's
awareness

Alive and alert.

Walking down the street.

So maybe no one would bother me.

Their hatred.

Not as a toy in my head.

“The Enormous Contradiction
We Have Sold Ourselves”

The murder and suicide of Pat Cone and her ex-husband, respec-
tively, in Lone Tree last week is too ""close to home"" both liter-
ally (because she worked and had friends here in Iowa City) and sym-
bolically (because every woman has seen and/or felt violence done
by a man or men to her or a woman close to her) for us to just let
it go by.

At the same time we saw the repeated fatal beatings, stranglings,
shootings of women by men close to them (we hear/see it on the
radio, TV, and newspapers every day) not as isolated incidents or
peculiar private crimes but as the product of the values our soc-
iety cherishes and promotes.

Males are socialized to see violence towards others, espec-
ially females, as a sign of affection. Females are socialized to
disarm their natural, self-protective instincts and to accept that
""VIOLENCE=LOVE"" double-think as truth. For males in our culture,
violence serves two purposes: (1) as a defense and outlet for
hostility and (2) as a love message, a way of communicating af-
fection (or deep caring). ""I can't live without you,"" so popular
in our songs and romantic myths translates easily into: ""so I'll
die unless I can have you."" Similarly, ""I don't want you to live
without me"" becomes ""I'll kill you if you leave me.""

In school and families around the time of puberty, girls are
taught to double-think when violence is done to them by boys, to not
react naturally and fight back, but rather to interpret a boy's
hitting them as ""he loves me!"" This brainwashing is an important
factor in preventing a woman from taking action to stop a man's
hurting her. Similarly, it works as an effective stop to anyone
else's interfering when a man is seen—say, on the street—hitting
a woman. Onlookers assume that because it is or may be a lover's
quarrel, it's ""their business"" only.

Even the laws enforce that kind of mentality. In most states
there has been legal support of men's violent crimes against wives

A Woman?

June

22, 1973

or female lovers. Men's crimes in these cases usually take a
lesser penalty—manslaughter, for example, in the event of the
woman's death; whereas women's slaying their husbands or male
lovers often is seen as murder in the first degree. In some states,
even with the same charge, a woman has gotten a stiffer sentence
for her ""family crime.""

The enormous contradiction we have sold ourselves—that some-
one is beating someone else because he loves her—puts women who
relate to violent male lovers (this is, sooner or later, most men
in our society) in the hideous double-bind of always hoping for
affection from the person who physically abuses her. How can she
prevent her own harm? He might be nice tonight when he comes
home, so, she reasons, she shouldn't leave or call on friends or
the police to deter him from hurting her. Anticipating his vio-
lence might bring it down on her, she fears. And, anyway, he
may beat me a little when he's upset but he's never seriously hurt
me.

Violence is violence. We should not see ""slapping her around
a little” as different in kind (only in degree) from the violence
that ends in fatal beatings, stranglings, knifings, shootings.
Everything begins little. Extreme violence is not exceptional; it
is the natural escalation of small violent acts.

The number and frequency of beatings and other violent crimes
as a cause of women's deaths in this society are so common as to
be ignored as an unchangeable part of ""the way things are.""

But nothing is unchangeable. We need all women to get together
with other women you know to talk about male violence against
yourselves or women close to you.
Sharing that grief and anger will help us understand what we live/
have lived under, and will help us decide how to put an end to that
oppression.

The story of Goldflower is well-known in China. A woman badly
abused by her husband, Goldflower gained support in ""speak bitter-
ness"" meetings with other wives in her town. As a group, they
warned Goldflower's husband that violence has no place in his
treatment of his wife. Still, he beat her. Then the women of the
town went together to his house and beat him. Convinced, he changed
his behavior; so did other men in the town.

Violence is no kin to loving. We must not lie to ourselves
about that anymore. We must teach our children the truth, too.

We must enforce our demand that violence against women stop. To do
that we must begin where we are, now."

Dedicated to Sarah Ottens  

Our goal is to regain control of our own bodies and lives.  
Yet, I am always amused and often greatly irritated to  
hear claims that the women's movement seeks to  
emasculate men. I should like to point out the irony of it.  
Women’s bodies have been subjected to men’s  
imaginations and manipulations for centuries.  

There were the pre-revolutionary Chinese who broke  
their women’s feet and socialized them into believing they  
were more beautiful that way when in reality they had  
fixed it so that their women could never run away from  
their slave positions.  

There were Moslem men who buried their women under  
veils and robes in the sweltering desert sun in order to  
inhibit their own sexual desires.  

There were the American bluecoats who sliced the  
genitals of Indian men and women, wearing the women's  
genitals on their hats for sport.  

There were the tortures of chastity belts, those iron girdles  
which not only prevented a woman's freedom of  
choice, but which were unbearable, cold contraptions  
which collected filth and disease. Women were left at home  
burning with disease while their Christian soldiers were  
raping Moslem women or lying dead on battlefields, the  
chastity belts’ keys gone forever.  

Freud managed to further louse things up for women by  
subjecting their psyches to his male interpretations of  
female sexuality. Post-Freudian doctors operated on  
women, removing their clitorises so they would experience  
the vaginal orgasms that Freud thought to be more mature  
than the “immature” clitoral orgasms.  

There were women who, because of church doctrine,  
were burned as witches, who died or suffered from forced  
motherhood or in the hands of illegal abortionists because  
the patriarchal church banned birth control and abortion.  
All these, not to mention countless women past and present  
in all societies who have been subjected by men to  
beatings, rape, murder and prostitution.  

Certainly when I think of all these inhuman,  
premeditated cruelties that women's bodies have endured  
due to whims of their menfolk, I must laugh in rage against  
some man's fear of being emasculated. When I dream of  
the inner rage of women collectively coming together for a  
purpose, and think: **Castration?’’...It would be too kind.  

The demystified Fortress  

Then,  

If I stole your armor,  
Your tron suit, lance,  
Face guards, epaulets,  
And put them in the Museum  
Under the Tower  
Where I secretly practiced  
Wearing them.  

I even perfected  
Your signature  

On my death warrant,  
Daddy,  
ALL of you aromatre,  
Robins-egg blue.  

Then I sat in the glass Tower  
Wondering if you could see me  
without my tron vest  

Or red wig; like Queen Bess  
Imagined letting your severed head  
Bleed over my velvet robe.  

--Barbara Unger  

Due to a pregnancy I was married at 19. My groom was 22. Men-  
tally and emotionally we were both children. During the first two  

years of my marriage I was slapped and knocked around quite often.  

Usually it happened when I could no longer keep my mouth shut and  
became ""bitchy"" about the fact that I was always home alone while  
he was out drinking or playing poker or with his girlfriend.  

Once he hit me while I was attempting to learn how to drive ""be-  
cause I was so stupid."" The encounter that I remember most vividly  
occurred the night I brought my child home from the hospital. It  
had never occurred to me to ask his permission to breastfeed my  
baby. It seems he had some fucked up hang-up about nursing. He  
claimed that he didn't want anyone sucking on my tits but him.  

I was completely intimidated and changed immediately to the bottle  
method. I never even considered nursing my second child. I had  

a black eye for two weeks that I received after a party for yelling  
at him in front of his friends about having an affair.  

For a long time I never said anything to anyone except my clos-  
est friend. Everyone who knew him thought him a gentle and kind  
person. During this time I never fought back. I just cowered and  
cried. I think I felt that the shame he later felt each time was  
my strongest weapon. At some point I couldn't stand it any longer  
and started to hit back. That may have happened twice before the  
violence ceased for good. I told him if he ever touched me again  
I would leave him. It took me four more years to get my shit to-  
gether to do that but it wasn't due to violence. Once during that  
time I confessed all this to some women who were also married.  

They all admitted similar experiences that they had never discussed  
before.  

Why this is not talked about, I'm not sure. I imagine most  
women are trying to protect their husbands, their marriages; mostly  
it is a real loss of face in suburban circles to admit that you are  
unhappy. I was never actually beat up, just knocked around. Some  
women are not so lucky and still nobody is talking. The taboo  
against admitting all this is so great that even now I find it in-  
credibly difficult to write this article.  

It's really bad but I kind of have an attitude that goes along the lines of straight  
women who are assaulted by their boyfriends and still continue to relate to them are  
stupid and there doesn't seem to be much I can do about it. I mean if they continue  
to allow themselves to be fucked over (and I see being fucked over as a form of vio-  
lence) and especially hit, then I can’t see a road open for me to even begin to bring  
them down. I don't know how to tell someone to take that first step. I see that as es-  
sential to dealing with women and violence. Women are going to have to retaliate and I  

Page 4  

know if I'm putting my life on that kind of line, it's not going to be for someone who  
will go and do the same thing over again.  

I want revenge and I deserve it but the revenge I seek is (1) personal against men  
that fuck lesbians over (2) political i.e. maybe it will give women courage to do some-  
thing about the violence they themselves are subjected to. I want men everywhere to  
be afraid of women in the same manner women are afraid of men. Men are not going to  
take this fear on voluntarily, they are going to have to be subjected to women's rage  
and not to one woman's rage but to women as a whole. I want the guy that I pass on a  
dark street late at night to be as afraid  

the morning and hear on the news that a man  
was found castrated in an alley every time I  
hear that a woman has been raped. I am para-  
noid and scared shitless of men because I  
know their violence that is directed toward  
women comes from a basic premise that women  
are lesser persons than they are and will  
not be able to harass them as much as a  
man (an equal) can so it's no sweat - no  
sweat to bat them around a bit. Well, they  
have got to learn that we are persons, we  
tried the education, dissertation, kissing  
ass, methods and women are still getting  
abused constantly so every day it becomes  
more and more apparent that direct physi-  
cal assault is the only answer."

a new feminist theory

PART I: An Open Letter to the Weatherwomen

Dear Sisters in the Weather Underground:

I am addressing this piece to you, in spite of the fact that my
concern at this point is with a far broader spectrum of women than
your tiny band of forgotten leftists, because it was our arguments
of the past year that convinced me to publicize my conversion from
the left to radical feminism. I realized after these arguments that
for me to keep silence would only support the illusion that the
""underground"" is united around the male politics which you still
espouse, and these politics and practices are too reprehensible to
me as a feminist to protect them by silence. I know that seeing
this letter - which you thought you would receive as a private com-
munication - here in print will shock you and that you will regard
much of its contents as a breach of the tacit code of honor among
political fugitives. Nevertheless, my own politics demand that I
share with all women my knowledge of the sexual oppression of the
left, if only to warn other sisters against the pain that has been
inflicted on us. Perhaps you personally will never open up to fem-
inism; yet the experiences I am going to relate may speak more ef-
fectively to women involved in other branches of the left, from
McGovern organizers to Socialist Workers Party members. And I have
some hope that the impact of a public statement may do what none of
my private arguments have succeeded in doing: persuade you to leave
the dying left in which you are floundering and begin to put your
immense courage and unique skills to work for women - for yourselves.

Since this is an open letter, let me summarize for other women
what you already know of my history underground and as a feminist.
I became a fugitive in May 1970, a few days before my scheduled
sentencing for conspiracy to bomb military and war-related corpor-
ate buildings in Manhattan. I was never part of SDS or of Weather-
man, and although I'd had conversations with Weatherpeople which
were influential in my decision to go underground rather than to
prison, I lost contact with the organization shortly after I became
a fugitive. I was a serious militant leftist at that time, and the
most feminist activity I'd ever been involved with was the all-
women’s newspaper Rat, which, despite its exclusion of men, re-
mained thoroughly left-identified. In the last three years I have
become a radical feminist. The change in my politics has not been
sudden, and I want to go into its causes and its substance much
more fully later in this paper. For now, I only want to set the
scene of my renewed acquaintance with the Weather Underground by
saying that when it occurred I was decisively through with the left
and had, at least mentally, rededicated myself to the cause of a
revolution made by and for women.

It was in this general frame of mind then, just about a year ago,
that I was attending a public lecture and, a few minutes after seat-
ing myself, noticed a man sitting nearby who looked vaguely famil-
iar. I would not have noticed him at all except for the fact that
he was very obviously staring at me and at the same time making
laughing, surprised comments to the people around him. I thought
with some alarm that he must be either an agent or a dangerous fool,
and I was both more and less apprehensive when I finally realized
who he was.

It was Mark Rudd.

After I recovered from the shock, I became excited by this rare
and unhoped-for opportunity to share experiences with a fellow
fugitive and for a short time I relished it in spite of the prob-
lems. Rudd was living with a woman I hadn't met before, whom I'll
call Caroline. She seemed to be a strong and sensitive person and
I would have loved to get to know her well, independently of Rudd
himself. This was not possible because Rudd made it difficult for
us to see each other without him, and because when the three of us
were together he made a practice of interrupting her and seemed to
regard himself as the spokesman for them both. Nevertheless, his
obvious dependence on her combined with his frequent apologies to
me for his manipulative behavior in past years (toward me in par-
ticular and women in general) gave me some hope that he had funda-
mentally changed and might even have become a sympathetic ally to
the Women's Movement. I was soon disillusioned.

What finally woke me to the reality of this man's character was
a conversation we had while Caroline was out of town. He made a
special point of wanting to get together with me at this time and,
as we were sitting on the front seat of a car on a rainy evening,
he attempted to put our relationship on a more intimate footing
by means of the following confession. He told me that approximate-
ly a year earlier Caroline had had a serious ovarian infection
which made sex very painful for her. This, he said, was the root
of a whole range of ""problems"" in their relationship, ranging from
his virtually raping her (he couldn't help himself, he said) to
his imagining himself in love with another woman. He described to
me how titillating he found it that this other woman looked on him
as a revolutionary hero, how she excited him sexually without sat-
isfying him intellectually, how he couldn't resist the excitement
of an affair with her though it was causing great anguish to Caro-
line. The affair ended, however, when he learned that the ""other""
woman was pregnant by him and that she wanted to have his child.
He regarded the pregnancy as entirely her own fault, since she had
stopped taking birth-control pills without telling him, and he ex-
plained that this willful and self-destructive carelessness - as he
saw it - was what had proved to him that ""a man can't politically
educate a woman."" It slowly dawned on me that Rudd was telling me
this story (1) because it proved what an irresistibly highly-sexed
masculine creature he was, and (2) because as a ""liberated woman,""
not to mention a presumably pro-abortion feminist, he quite sin-
cerely expected me to cluck a sympathetic tongue over his problems
with this dumb chick.

I told Rudd in the strongest terms of which I was capable how
appalling his behavior was to me, but though my failure to sympa-
thize seemed to startle him, nothing I could say would convince
him of the seriousness with which I regarded his crimes. ""Of course
I trust you,"" were his benevolently paternalistic last words to
me. ""I know you wouldn't do something like those Boston women who
denounced Eric Mann (a Weatherman who served a two-year prison
term) as a sexist pig who deserved his imprisonment.""

While it wasn't possible for me to establish much of a relation-
ship with Caroline given the short time we were in the same geo-
logical area and Rudd's obtuse omnipresence, I could at least look
forward to getting in touch, through Rudd, with women in the Wea-
ther Underground. I was wary about this because I knew you Weather-
women had never given a sign, publicly or privately, of being more
receptive to a feminist point of view than Rudd himself was; that
you had never risked the esteem of leftist men in any statement or
action; and that the few statements of your organization which
made reference to the Women's Movement revealed a complete failure
to understand it and an intense eagerness to co-opt it. Neverthe-
less, I respected - and respect - you in a way I never could Rudd.
I knew it was your strength that had held the organization together
when the men's desperate egomania threatened to destroy you all. I
could count on the fact that as women - and specifically as women
fugitives - we shared certain experiences that could bring us
closer together in outlook and feelings than would be possible
with even the most sympathetic and sensitive man. Finally, what-
ever the risk, it seemed well worth it if I could give even one
woman in our situation support that would help her stand up for
herself, and for all women, against our oppression in a movement
that puts our interests last. Encouragingly, my very first meeting
with one of you was a wonderful experience for me, and I was much
moved by the warm reception and attention this woman gave me and
my politics, and the genuine respect that I felt from her as well
as for her. (I suspect now, in the aftermath of other meetings,
that this may have been partly because she was unprepared for the
radical changes in my politics and therefore responded to me open-
ly and honestly. The rest of you had, in advance of meeting me,
already armored yourselves against revealing too much of your
""personal problems"" as women in a male organization.) For whatever
reason, I was, as it turned out, all too ready to plunge into a dia-
logue in which I used my own skin as wallpaper while you side-
stepped and evaded every issue.

Your resistance to discussing your personal experience, your
trivializing of your own pain and suffering, your insistence that
the oppression of others is more important than your own - these
are part of the self-contempt that has been bred in all of us wo-
men, and I understand it as I understand myself. I can even deal
with your more contrived evasions, the ones that were obviously
developed only after years of building defenses against the threat
that the Women's Movement seems to you. I can see why you over-
looked security so that, apparently by chance, I ran into one more
Weatherwoman than we had agreed I would meet during the brief time
we were together, a woman who just ""happened to be"" rabidly anti-
feminist. I know what advantage you saw in circulating a vicious,
unfounded rumor about a well-known feminist and then asserting she
herself was not to blame for her errors because the Women's Move-
ment was responsible for her psychological destruction. I can un-
derstand too well the reasons for your flippant claim that it
""bores"" you to talk about men, a pathetic way to avoid admitting
your oppression.

But the wall I cannot surmount is your insistence that if I
really practiced sisterhood I wouldn't make demands on you in the
name of feminism, but would respect your political path as equally
valid to my own. You want me to accept your claim that you are no
longer dominated by men, as you admit you were when you first
joined Weatherman, as in fact we all are as long as we live under
patriarchy. Yet in the same breath that you claim, ""Women run the
organization,"" you admit that of the five members of the Weather-
man Central Committee, three are men. And you have no shame in
telling me that one of these three is Bill Ayers, notorious for his
callous treatment and abandonment of Diana Oughton before her
death and for his generally fickle and high-handed treatment of
women; and that another is Jeff Jones, who once told that dull-
witted misogynist Robert Palmer that if I thought Weatherman was
a male supremacist organization, I could ""suck his dick."" Or have
Ayers and Jones now become feminists too - like Mark Rudd, who,
after a year's leave to overcome his ""arrogance and insensitivity""
(which you won't even call by its true name: sexism) you are ad-
mitting back into the organization?

The politico-feminist split is a real one, one that will vanish
as soon as we accept ourselves as women first of all, but which
will continue to divide us until we share that consciousness. It
is you leftists, you male-identified socialist and liberal and
pacifist and Weather-sympathizing women, who try to deny any sig-
nificant difference between male politics and feminist politics.
""We're all just women,"" you say, and we are - but to you this is
a phenomenon of the most peripheral possible interest, indeed it
only seems to occur to you when under fire from feminists. As long
as you are working politically with men, as long as you are letting
men define your attitudes, behavior and standards, then we stand
on opposite sides of a line all too visible to me in spite of your
blindness to it, but which I know you too will see once you have
crossed it. And to cross it you need do only one thing: let your
own self-interest be your highest priority. I am not asking you
to stop loving men, or to break all personal and emotional ties
with the men who are important to you. I know that those ties are
more..."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page006.txt,AintIAWoman,,6,"never broken out of a simplistic political decision but only when  
and if consciousness of oppression makes them so inconsistent with  
self-respect that they can no longer be borne. Even then it is  
with enormous pain and grief and in spite of an ever-reluctant  
part of ourselves that we separate from men we have cared for. I  
firmly believe that one can be a serious feminist and still live  
with and relate to a man and to men. The gulf that is between us  
is not that, but rather that you allow men to rule on your politics.  

Believe me, I understand your side of it. I've been on that  
side - I've practically drowned on that side. Over a year ago I  
wrote an introduction to a book of the prison letters of Sam Nel-  
ville, a man I loved and lived with who was killed in the Attica  
uprising of September 1971. I was already a feminist when I wrote  
that introduction and had theoretically rejected the politics that  
Melville had taught me and that he had lived and died for. Yet I  
had never found the courage or the words to tell him that while he  
lived, and especially while influenced by the powerful feelings  
that his murder aroused in me, I was incapable of writing the  
truth of his male supremacy - that underside of men's lives that  
only women know - in my eulogistic essay on his life. Since this  
is the last time I will ever write about him, I would like to tell  
some of that truth here.  

CoyW  

I was very much pressured, against my own sense of tactics and  
timing, into playing the role I did in the group of radical bombers  
Melville half-led, half-dragged along with him. The pressure was  
of the kind peculiar and common to male-female relationships: he  
constantly threatened to leave me if I backed out. What he valued  
in me, besides having a dependable sexual partner and housekeeper,  
was what he took to be my ""independence"" and ""self-sufficiency"" -  
as he often told me. This made me useful to him as an ally, and  
further assured him that I had the quality he prized above all  
others in women: the capacity to love him devotedly, yet get along  
without him uncomplainingly whenever he chose to leave. The last  
letter I received from him exhorted me against writing narrow-  
mindedly of loving and needing him, instead of writing about great  
social truths (the ones he was concerned with, that is). ""To speak  
of love, especially love between one desperate man and woman, limits  
our vision and ties us to the past."" Yet the same letter ends on  
an explicitly sexual note: ""Yes, sweet bitch, I love you. And if  
they ever let me out and the wind is right, I'll find you."" This  
was typical; he would never ""degrade"" himself by admitting love  
for a woman in any fashion not immediately tied to his sexual  
pleasure.  

A few months before we were arrested, Sam began a secret affair  
with a woman friend of ours whom I hadn't seen in some time. In  
order to keep us from comparing notes on his behavior, he told her  
he was no longer living with me. He also at least hinted to her  
that the sabotage of military and corporate buildings around the  
city was the work of himself and friends. I discovered his betray-  
al only by the coincidence of having acquaintances in common with  
the other woman, acquaintances to whom she had repeated Sam's  
hints. To this day I don't know how many other dangerous, possibly  
fatal, violations of security his masculinist need to boast led  
him to commit.  

Some will say Melville's sexism was extreme just as his politics  
were extreme. Yet I have seen his behavior duplicated in the most  
bourgeois households by males of all political persuasions, econ-  
omic backgrounds, ages and skin colors. I never knew Sam to cook  
a meal for himself; he once wrote WASH ME in black magic marker  
on the side of the refrigerator as a cute reminder of my responsi-  
bilities; he threatened to leave me, and meant it, if I took up  
smoking cigarettes after having given them up to please him; he  
wouldn't allow our lease, our telephone, our utilities bill, our  
bank account or anything else we shared to be in his name on the  
ostensible grounds that he was delinquent with his income tax and  
didn't want to be found through public records. The real reason,  
it turned out, was that he didn't want his wife to find him and  
demand the child support he owed her and hadn't paid in years.  

He was sexually impotent unless he could fantasize the woman  
he was with as a prostitute and she went along with his fantasy.  

At one point Sam joined a political group headed by Rap Brown.  
This group's attitude toward women was bigotry itself: they didn't  
include any and they didn't intend to. According to Brown himself,  
as quoted by Melville, women would be ""a distraction from serious  
business."" When I confronted Sam on this, he seemed slightly en-  
barrassed but wouldn't even commit himself to discussing male su-  
premacy with his new idol, Rap Brown. Recalling this, I'm reminded  
ironically of the division of all-Black bomber pilots stationed  
out of Texas during World War II who, despite phenomenal sacri-  
fices and heroism were forbidden the supposed privilege of being  
integrated with White battalions. How strange it is that not only  
the man I lived with but one of the most brilliant and sophisto-  
cated Black militants of the 1960s should turn out to have the  
same kind of crass ignorance about women.  

And so, my sisters in Weatherman, you fast and organize and  
demonstrate for Attica. Don't send me news clippings about it,  
don't tell me how much those deaths moved you.  

I will mourn the loss of 42 male supremacists no longer.

Part II: The Education of a Feminist At-Large  

My first year underground was very hard. Expecting to die for  
the Revolution in a matter of months, I was unprepared to find my-  
self not only alive but living a rather unadventurous and secluded  
existence less than a year after ""disappearing."" I found it in-  
creasingly difficult to get along with the friends with whom I was  
still in touch, especially with the men who were becoming increas-  
ingly overbearing and critical of my actions, as I was growing in-  
creasingly sensitive to their interference. Chafing at every re-  
striction, hostile even to the one woman friend I really cared for,  
I finally decided to take off on my own, reasoning that it couldn't  
get much worse. I started to travel and for a few months just  
roamed, almost aimlessly, from one community to another across the  
country.  

As I traveled, I slowly became aware that nothing was less rele-  
vant to the lives of most people in this country than the white  
left, with which I still identified myself. The leftist (and right-  
ist, for that matter) distinctions between working class and ruling  
class, hippies and straight people, youth and Establishment, all  
seemed increasingly absurd to me. They seemed to determine nothing  
of certainty about anyone's attitude or political outlook. As I  
moved around I could see more clearly than ever the oppression of  
Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican and Indian peoples. Yet at the same  
time I was learning concretely that women existed in well-defined  
subcultures within each White and Third World community. Finally  
all my experiences kept reminding me of one fact of my own identity  
I was continually trying to forget: that I was a woman. Men, Third  
World and otherwise, young and old, hippie and straight, related to  
me as Woman, all my other interests or characteristics being, in  
their eyes, mere modifications of that one essential. Whether I was  
desired, rejected, abused, admired, ignored, treated with kindness  
or hostility, it was basically because I was a female doing whatever  
it was I was doing. Women generally took their cue of how to relate  
to me from the way men related to me, or I to men. It occurred to  
me that this was no different from the way people I had known for  
years had related to me but because we had known each other well I  
had been aware of the subtleties in our relationships to the point  
of being blind to the underlying structure. Of course I had heard  
feminists express these perceptions before, and had even asserted  
them myself occasionally, but I had never internalized them. I now  
began to think that if my politics were to be based on my own situ-  
ation and not on someone else's perception of reality, I would have  
to deal with the fact that the rest of the world thought of me as a  
woman first of all, before it even listened to what I had to say.  

Together with these discoveries, I began to realize the astonish-  
ing impact the Women's Movement has had over the U.S. in just a few  
years. I could see women everywhere, White, Black, Brown, Indian,  
responding in their daily lives to the fact that some woman some-  
where had said, ""Men oppress us."" I came to know Chicana women liv-  
ing in a barrio who were organizing women's health care programs  
and women's antirape squadrons to patrol their own neighborhood.  

A White woman, mother of three, from a poor Southern family and on  
welfare, talked to me with great eloquence about how she saw the  
courts, the police, the welfare system and her ex-husband as all  
part of the same male-run system, which women needed to take over  
and run for their own benefit. A woman I met who had been born  
into a wealthy and traditional Japanese family told me she was  
filing for divorce against a husband who physically and mentally  
abused her because she refused to go through life suffering from  
the same causes her mother and grandmother had before her. These  
women - all random examples - would not necessarily say or think  
that they were part of the Women's Movement. But they demonstrated  
to me, among others, that the changing consciousness represented  
by the Women's Movement has been more far-reaching than any public-  
opinion poll on Women's Liberation would seem to show. As for the  
frequently heard opinion that Third World women support Third  
World liberation but not Women's Liberation, I believe that this  

is true chiefly of a few women who are highly regarded by Third  
World male radicals and hence are considered newsworthy by the  
media. Among the majority of Third World women, it seems to me  

that the Women's Movement is spreading and its ideas are having  
increasing effect, just as among White women.  

The turning point of my personal rapprochement with feminism  
came when, a year after I'd left New York as a fugitive, I joined  
a women's tap group composed of a half-dozen other women, of wide-  
ly different economic backgrounds, ages and family situations,  
brought together only by our common desire - or desperate need -  
to talk with other women about our lives. No one in the group  
knew who I was, or that I was wanted on a federal warrant. I know,  
though, that they all sensed my unspoken inner turmoil (if not the  
specific causes of it) and in response gave me more positive emo-  
tional and intellectual support than I could have imagined possi-  
ble from a group of strangers. They sustained me through the crisis  
I underwent after Melville's murder and the dramatic upheavals  
in my consciousness involved in that experience. Eventually, when  
a series of circumstances forced me to leave the area in which I'd  
come to know them, they gave me, as a group, the help and strength  
I needed to face yet another move into the unknown.  

The process of the consciousness-raising group, for me and for  
the other women involved, was one in which we began to be able to  
define ourselves as individuals and as women. Some of us had pre-  
viously conceived of ourselves as exceptional women, some of us  
thought being female necessarily meant being passive and dependent,  

Responses to Jane Alpert by five Iowa City Dykes follow this article.  

a woman?  

but it soon became clear that we had come to the group each in a  
private panic of no longer knowing who we were. What we discovered  
in each other was the pulse of a culture and a consciousness which  
was common to us as women. We discovered it as something that had  
always been there, but that we had not previously recognized or  
felt able to trust. Trusting it - or gaining confidence in our  
thoughts, feelings, resentments, desires and intuitions as attri-  
butes that we shared as a people and which were therefore valid -  
became the basis of beginning to trust ourselves as individuals.  

I believe that the struggle to define oneself for oneself ulti-  
mately takes place in a realm of the mind in which one is always  
alone and unsupported. For some women the existence of a women's  
group or even a Women's Movement has not been a necessary precon-  
dition of that struggle. Individual women of genius - artists,  
scientists, philosophers, activists and visionaries - have left us  
written and other evidence to prove that throughout the history of  
patriarchy some women have found it possible to call upon their  
inner powers to create and achieve and succeed. For each of these  
women, many others who were unable to leave us records have man-  
aged to define their individuality and assert themselves in the  
face of enormous male hostility. And yet the evidence we have  
proves ultimately only that no matter how many obstacles are in  
the way, a few women will possess the ability, determination and  
special privilege to overcome them. In considering social change  
it is of much more significance that today's Women's Movement has  
encouraged thousands of women who would never have done so before  
to discover and develop their unique talents, and to stand up  
against male prerogatives and values with originality and courage.  
Moreover, as increasing numbers of women are turning to art, sci-  
ence and other creative efforts, a truly female - that is, a fem-  
inist - culture is beginning to take shape. It seems little short  
of miraculous that with so little in the way of facilities - still  
very few research grants, little access to the best laboratories,  
to substantial publishing contracts and the like, our own culture  
has nevertheless managed to take root and flourish. Feminist news-  
papers, literary magazines, cooperative childcare centers, anthro-  
pology collectives, legal clinics, poetry workshops, self-help  
medical clinics, counseling services, music groups and graphics  
collectives are a few of the new-born alternative institutions  
providing the access for women whose values and vision are unac-  
ceptable to the patriarchy, or who choose not to pay the artistic  
and emotional price exacted by men in exchange for a share of  
male privilege. Even more significantly, the products of these al-  
ternative institutions (and of the individual women involved with  
them or working on their own) are qualitatively different from the  
products of men and male institutions. For instance, a feminist  
all-women's rock band sounds different from a male rock band or  
from an all-women's rock band trying to reproduce male music; they  
are not only singing different lyrics but the melodies and harmon-  
ies and rhythms are different. Feminist anthropologists are ap-  
proaching their subject from a different perspective and with dif-  
ferent assumptions than male anthropologists, or women anthropolo-  
gists in the past who had only male-defined standards and methods  
at their disposal. Feminist teachers are creating a different style  
of classroom situation with their women students. Feminist lawyers  
are helping their clients to use the law to help themselves. All of  
us are not engaged in such activities but many of us share in the  
changing consciousness that these women are expressing publicly.  
And in light of the accomplishments already generated from this  
changing consciousness, I think we need to take another look not  
only at the old male-supremacist assumptions about women's ""nature""  
but also at some of the assertions of the Women's Movement so far.  
Just what is the powerful source of this consciousness?  

For centuries feminists have asserted that the essential differ-  
ence between women and men does not lie in biology but rather in  
the roles that patriarchal societies (men) have required each sex  
to play. The motivation for this assertion is obvious: women's bi-  
ology has always been used to justify women's oppression. As patri-  
archal reasoning went, since ""God"" or ""nature"" or ""evolution"" had  
made woman the bearer and nurser of the species, it logically fol-  
lowed that she should stay home with the children and perform as a  
matter of more-or-less ordained duty all the domestic chores invol-  
ved in keeping and feeding a household. When women work outside the  
home we have the most menial and lowest-paid tasks to perform,  
chiefly because any labor a woman performs outside the home is  
thought to be temporary and inessential to her, no matter how she  
herself might be inclined to regard it. Naturally then, the first  
healthy impulse of feminism is to deny that simply because women  
have breasts or uteruses we are better suited to wash dishes, scrub  
floors or change diapers. As newly-roused feminists, we retorted to  
evidence that women might be intrinsically better suited to perform  
some roles than others by pointing out that men have been forcing  
these roles on us for at least five thousand years. After such time  
conditioning and habit are so strong that they appear to be intrin-  
sic and innate.  

However, a flaw in this feminist argument has persisted: it con-  
tradicts our felt experience of the biological difference between  
the sexes as one of immense significance. To begin with, it seems  
obvious that biology alone would, in primitive societies, have dic-  
tated different roles and different powers as appropriate to each  
sex. And biological scientists have indeed assumed, for the most  
part, that the physical passivity of the female mammal during inter-  
course and the demands of pregnancy, childbirth and nursing clearly  
indicate the role of women as biologically determined, and inferior.  
In response to this, Shulamith Firestone, with the publication of  
The Dialectic of Sex in 1970, articulated the definitive feminist  
antithesis to this idea by"
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page007.txt,AintIAWoman,,7,"and strongest in women, and as we begin to define ourselves as  
women, the qualities coming to the fore are the same ones a mother  
projects in the best kind of nurturing relationship to a child:  
empathy, intuitiveness, adaptability, awareness of growth as a  
process rather than as goal-ended, inventiveness, protective feel-  
ings towards others and a capacity to respond emotionally as well  
as rationally. If matriarchy means a society in which these are  
the qualities all human beings admire and strive to embody, a so-  
ciety in which the paradigm for all social relationships is the  
relationship of a healthy and secure mother to her child, then  
matriarchy means nothing less than the end of oppression.  

Interestingly enough, the materialist analysis brings us to  
conclusions similar to the ones I have just set forth from an  
idealist standpoint. In the Marxist dialectical-materialist view  
of history, the ""vanguard"" of the ""revolutionary class"" is that  
group which is not only greatly exploited by the class in power  
but which is also performing labor essential to the functioning  
of society. The ruling class is thereby forced to respond to de-  
mands which it puts forth in the name of the oppressed. A third  
requirement is that the class be potentially collective; each mem-  
ber should not be severely isolated from every other. In classical  
Marxism, the ""revolutionary vanguard"" is composed of the ""indus-  
trial proletariat"" who must sell their labor to the capitalists  
in order to eat, whose labor is essential to industry and there-  
fore to society, and whose work process is socialized. No revolu-  
tion founded on Marxist principles has adhered to the classic pat-  
tern: in Russia the proletariat was a tiny minority with no influ-  
ence at the time of the Bolshevik revolution, and Mao had to re-  
write both Marx and Lenin to suit Chinese conditions, defining the  
peasantry as the ""vanguard"" in that context. The industrial prole-  
tariat in the U.S. today are a larger group than in either pre-  
revolutionary Russia or prerevolutionary China, but are not, by  
and large, an exploited one. Through unions they have acquired a  
significant share of power, and their right-wing views do not  
spring from ""false class consciousness"" but rather from a hard-  
nosed sense of their own self-interest. Taken alone, Third World  
male industrial workers are much less privileged, and women in  
industry are the most exploited of all of these in respect to both  
wages and working conditions; but these very divisions of the  
""proletariat"" show the obstacles to its solidarity more pointedly  
than anything else. However, if, with Firestone, we transfer our  
focus from economics to sex, that is, from production to repro-  
duction, the Marxist terminology itself begins to make more sense.  
For there is very clearly a large group of women who by reason  
both of exploitation and importance to the society perfectly an-  
swer the requirements of the vanguard, and who are increasingly  
closely in touch with one another. These women are, of course,  
mothers.  

Mothers live by their labor yet generally without standardized  
wages. If they have husbands who earn good money and are generous,  
they are amply supplied - but only as long as they can keep their  
husbands. Otherwise, they have little or nothing outside the nec-  
essities and whatever they do have goes to their children first.  
The only mothers who do earn a standard wage for the labor of  
child-rearing are those on welfare, and that pay is barely enough  
to sustain life. The job is without guarantees of security of any  
kind. Its workday is twenty-four hours, workweek seven days, no  
vacations, no holidays. Total dedication to the job is expected,  
and yet a woman who works ""only"" in the home is regarded, with  
some contempt, as an unemployed housewife. Women with children are  
the women who most frequently suffer from fatigue, headaches, list-  
lessness, depression, insomnia, digestive disorders, loss of ener-  
gy, nervous tension and other illnesses common to women. If the  
women who work in factories were all replaced by men, it would rep-  
resent some economic cost to industry but no alteration in the  
power structure or the basic assumptions of society concerning sex  
and class roles. The labor of these same women in the home, how-  
ever - and of all women who work at child-rearing, whether of their  
own children, adopted children or someone else's children for wages  
- cannot be replaced on a mass scale without cataclysmic changes in  
the social structure.  

Mothers are a distinctly defined group. Nevertheless, their in-  
terests as a group are in no way opposed to the interests of women  
as a whole, but are rather intimately linked with these. For mo-  
therhood itself is only the concrete expression of that potential  
which defines all women. Accordingly the domestic situation of  
women underlies the way we are treated on the job market. But the  
point of Mother Right is to reshape the family according to the  
perceptions of women, and to reshape the society in the image of  
this new matriarchal family. Because motherhood cuts across econ-  
omic class, race and sexual preference, a society in which women  
were powerful by virtue of being mothers would not be divided  
along any of these lines. Nor would any new division between women,  
such as between mothers and childless women, arise, because the  
root of motherhood and the root of female consciousness are, I  
believe, the same.  

Returning to my personal experience again, my self-interest in  
changing society is bound up with that of women who have children  
much more deeply than it is, for example, with women demanding  
equal pay for equal work, despite the fact that I am single, child-  
less and must work to support myself. If I had to sum up in a few  
words what I feel to be my own oppression in this society, I would  
say, ""The enormous economic, social and psychological obstacles  
against bearing and raising children of my own."" While my situation  
as a fugitive seems to all but eliminate any hope that I might  
raise a child of my own, even these unusual circumstances are only  
slightly more handicapping than those any other woman faces when  
contemplating motherhood without marriage, or at least a stable  
relationship to a man. These obstacles and the tools to overcome  
them are beginning to be studied and developed by many different  
women, notably by Lesbians who have or want to have children. The  
oppression suffered by women whose sexual preference is for other  
women is peculiar to patriarchy, it seems to me, and would be elim-  
inated as soon as women cease to be pawns in male power games. If  
Mother Right were the informing principle of society, it would make  

8 volume 3 number 4  

no difference whether a woman lived with men or women, let alone  
with whom she slept. A woman would be powerful and respected simply  
as a woman, and particularly esteemed as a mother, regardless of  
whom she lived with. For far from being in a position to exploit  

a woman because she chose to live and/or sleep with other women, a  
man would consider himself fortunate if a woman only chose to live  
and/or sleep with him.  

The conditions of life in the patriarchy are such that the over-  
whelming majority of women in the foreseeable future will continue  
to marry and raise children and to regard that role as the central  
one in their lives. This majority includes millions of women who  
also have jobs outside their homes. The Women's Movement is their  
movement not only because they are a majority, but because feminist  
consciousness springs directly from the role they play in society.  
Many segments of the Women's Movement are now beginning to implicit-  
ly recognize this truth and act upon it. N.O.W. is making a major  
push to speak to the needs of housewives by agitating for an end  
to discrimination against married women by banks, insurance compan-  
ies and credit unions. Radical feminists are demanding less that  
women leave men, and suggesting that it might be more effective in  
building a revolutionary base if women instead move to become heads  
of their families. Outside the consciously political segment of  
the Women's Movement, housewives are beginning to unite and to agi-  
tate for their common interests, starting with lower food prices.  
More mothers are expressing their dissatisfactions and talking  
about their problems, while not necessarily seeing these as rela-  
ted to the Women's Movement; more women within the Movement are  
beginning to experience their feelings as mothers as feelings  
which are integral to their identities as women. Demands relating  
to jobs, professional opportunities and electoral representation  
will continue to be important, partly because the unequal treatment  
of women in these areas makes people aware of women's overall in-  
ferior status, and partly because increasing numbers of women  
want and need to support themselves with jobs outside the home.  

But the Women's Movement must, and will, begin to focus on those  
demands which relate concretely to women's role in child-rearing.  
These more radical-feminist demands include: wages for all women  
engaged in child-rearing; paid holidays and vacations; collective  
child-care centers controlled by mothers with the participation  

of all members of the community, including fathers, older children  
and childless adults; laboratories and research facilities to be  
turned over to feminist scientists so that research into contra-  
ception, fertility, pregnancy and birth can be conducted in women's  
interests; hospital and outpatient facilities related to women's  
health to be run and staffed by women; self-help clinics, financed  
by the government but under community control; artificial insemin-  
ation, sterilization procedures, facilities for extra-uterine birth,  
and related technology to be made widely available. Technology is  
a powerful tool which will free us to bear and raise our children  
in our own way at our own time. It must be turned over to women  
now, in order to prevent its becoming an even more powerful weapon  
against us and indeed against all life.  

It is the uprising of women which will presage the end of op-  
pression, but this uprising must be based on more than opposition  
to oppression and the definition of Woman as Other. It must be an  
affirmation of the power of female consciousness, of the Mother.  
The changes which it will embody can perhaps be better imagined  
as primarily spiritual and religious, rather than economic and  
social, though they will include and embody the latter. Thus a more  
apt analogy than the Cuban or Chinese revolutions might be the Ref-  
ormation or the Christian revolution, or perhaps the revolution  
made by the patriarchy itself when the ancient gynocracies were  
invaded. I use these analogies because in each of these cases the  
economic and political changes were enormous, but they followed  
rather than preceded sweeping changes in human consciousness. The  
ripples spread through the institutions from the masses of people,  
rather than the other way around.  

These were not, and never will be, gentle ripples. The oppress-  
or is equipped with the tools of mechanized violence as never be-  
fore; we are only beginning to reclaim the ancient rage that will  
defeat his evil. Feminism is teaching us, again, the healing power  
of anger trained on the true enemies of ourselves and our children,  
and our anger will supply us the resources we will need against  
the Man's weapons. Yet, from another point of view, we may remind  
ourselves that the violence of this cataclysm is no more nor less  
than the outward sign of a struggle of the human spirit. It seems  
very significant to me that simultaneously with the contemporary  
rise of feminism, there is a great rise of interest in psychic and  
spiritual phenomena. Because the Women's Movement gets lumped with  
the left in many people's minds, it is mistakenly regarded as  
narrowly ""political."" Yet feminism concerns more than political  
power, essential as that is. It is closely tied to theories of  
awakening consciousness, of creation and rebirth and of the essen-  
tial oneness of the universe - teachings which lie at the heart of  
all Goddess-worshiping religions.  

We are on the threshold of what all the ancient wisdoms, many  
of them handed down from matriarchal times, teach is a new age of  
consciousness and simultaneously on what seems scientifically to  
be a threshold in the evolution of the species, as the genetic  
code is broken and life produced in the laboratory. Could it not  
be that just at the moment masculinity has brought us to the brink  
of nuclear destruction or ecological suicide, women are beginning  
to rise in response to the Mother's call to save Her planet and  
create instead the next stage of evolution? Can our revolution  
mean anything else than the reversion of social and economic con-  
trol to Her representatives among Womankind, and the resumption  
of Her worship on the face of the Earth? Do we dare demand less?

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page008.txt,AintIAWoman,,8,"JO JANE... I'm struggle

Dear Jane,  
“I was very glad to receive your communication. Glad also that you are well and to hear of your political conversion.

I was impressed by your analysis. It was new to me, but I could see it had been thoroughly thought out.

Later as I was thinking about it, I wondered what is the purpose of such an analysis, even though I have read them, written them, been excited by just this type of far-reaching analysis before. Maybe it was that it didn't touch me personally enough because I am a lesbian and we are prevented from even vicariously enjoying our mother-right.

That is the context in which I was thinking. What good does it do to determine who the vanguard is? Does the act of determining them make them rise up? Do communications have to be directed to them to raise their consciousness about being oppressed so that can happen?

If they know they are the vanguard, what do they do? Pick up weapons we do not know how to use because we are women? Or will it be more of a general strike? All women refusing to take care of children and bringing things to a halt this Lysistrata way.

There are other things I question. It seems to me that even though you don't identify with women struggling for equal pay for equal work, this is a more widespread and gut-level interest among women than mother-right. Especially among working-class women where pay differential is more crucial.

Yes, I agree women in the movement are beginning to experience their feelings as mothers, but I don't know that this is any more integral to our identities as women than women becoming in tune with their feelings of love and sexuality for other women. Certainly you would agree that these feelings must have been a part of the culture of the gynarchies and Amazon nations of long ago. What Elizabeth Gould Davis is describing in The First Sex reminds me of the culture Sappho nurtured on the island of Lesbos.

I'm not saying that I have the right analysis and yours is wrong. But I've learned in dealing with analysis and direction that if you don't have the answers, questions are the next best thing. The inability to tolerate different perspectives from different oppressed groups of people is a problem the women's movement has. Different groups of women can work to form their own interests, but they must consider and deal with the oppressions of the other groups i.e., class, race, gayness, motherhood, age, etc. Maybe this is why I don't tend to think in terms of vanguards. Probably different groups have different conceptions of who the vanguard is. If I thought in these terms I would name lesbians as the vanguard.

I can imagine where you are in your head because I was there. The excitement of realizing the dynamic of feminism as a basis for social revolution. But I find it ironic that I am maybe closer to where you were originally (politically) and you are now closer to where I was. I don't know. I think it would be a shame if you let the talents you learned in Weatherman slide before you taught them to other women.

With every mention of mother-right in your article, my body tenses and strains to hold in all the hysterical anger and repulsion that term evokes in me. I hate the term, Jane, and everything it means to me is worse than Mark Rudd or Sam Melville. You claim this mother-right as a basis of some kind of liberating direction for all women, but I know in my gut I am left out of that. Before I knew I was gay, I knew I didn't want to reproduce myself—the thought repulsed me more than any fears my childhood saw. My ability to reproduce means nothing to me and I don't want my ability to mean anything to anyone else either.

Within this society and the reality we all live, certain situations are going to mean certain kinds of oppression for women. Relating to and living with men is going to be oppressive, having children is going to be oppressive, and so are a lot of other things. But, the two things I mentioned we have more control over (we can choose not to do) unlike other things (jobs for instance) that we don't have much choice over. A gay mother wrote in an article for our last issue on childcare that she thought there was a choice involved in having a child but that that choice did not justify her oppression. I agree with that. I don't think women who relate to men or women who have children deserve what they get. What I am trying to say is they do get what they could have intelligently expected and gawd damn we know we have so much to do to arrive anywhere close to freedom. I wish we would stop wasting our time choosing a situation which will according to our own analysis oppress us. Buy a gun every time you experience your mother instinct—whatever the hell that is and I don't know what the hell it is. I have never felt it. Where do I fit into your future society? As a mother's helper? Fuck that.

I am aware that you have been influenced by The First Sex. It seems to be the rage. I haven't read it but have been real unhappy with what people have been thinking and talking about having been influenced by that book. I am in no way interested in recreating the past. I don't understand why anybody is interested in being biologically superior to anyone. That is a distasteful line of thought.

The feelings I'm expressing are very personal and involve what I want my role in any society to be. But I haven't spoken to the point that many women like yourself want to have children. That is a right I think any woman should have if she wants it. How that would be accomplished without the now-present accompanying oppression in some post-revolutionary society can only be speculative. But the present is real and upholding a woman's right to childbirth means a lot to childless women. It means that childless women must help a lot to avoid a mother being oppressed because she is a mother. It is free labor and because a mother still has property rights over her child (and I should add that with the recent adulation of mother-right it is sanctioned) the labor put in by childless women for mothers is exploited.

What the issue of childcare has done to all of us is push us to attempt to achieve some post-revolutionary state without having made any material changes in society—to set personal behavior codes that are unreachable. The attempts frustrate all of us and stagnate us. Attempting the impossible I do not find admirable. I think it kills and destroys human potential. And I want to repeat again that even though I do see the oppression of mothers and see its unjustness, the property right that mothers (especially recently, movement mothers) understandably cling to is exploitative to childless women. Especially exploitative to those childless women who mothers confront and guilt-trip into doing childcare. I do believe that mothers' demands on childless women are justified when you consider the oppression that mothers suffer and the help they need, but the subject of property rights was never fully considered and many mothers insisted on wanting to deny such rights only later under the influence of the glory of mother-right to take up their right again and hurt many childless women who developed attachments to their children by taking the children away.

We tried to deal with motherhood and childcare. We had a daycare center where childless gay women worked and other non-institutional childcare arrangements were made. They weren't perfect and people made mistakes, arguments between mothers and non-mothers, straight and gay women were heated but I think people were trying. In the end we discovered what we knew from the beginning: gay women are not allowed to do childcare in this society and mothers have all the power regarding their own children. The result of all of this remains to be seen. The center closed because of county and state investigations and threat of custody suits, mothers are still overburdened and do not trust childless women and childless women feel used.

So I do worry about your whole theory primarily because of my identity and the experiences I have had. I hope this is understandable.

P.S. I should try and make it clear that when I speak of property rights and power—in fact everything I spoke to, I am speaking within the context of a women's community and so refer to the relationships that exist within that community. I am well aware that mothers, although having more power in regard to their own children than childless women, most often have less power than men and always less than the state.

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page009.txt,AintIAWoman,,9,"dear jane,

I don't know how exactly to respond to your theory of mother
right as the basis for feminist revolution. I find it to be something I very much disagree with and with increasing intensity each
time I read your letter, but it is hard for me to sort out where
that feeling is coming from--whether it comes from personally being
fucked over by mother right or from real revulsion at the idea
of motherhood being so glorified. Probably, it comes from both.

I think what hits me most about your article is its inherent
heterosexuality and the picture it paints of a post-feminist
revolutionary society which gives little or no indication of not
being the same entrenched heterosexual world. I think at the basis
of your theory of mother right is the assumption that women
are heterosexual beings. Obviously, motherhood, at least for now
(and you give little indication and/or support of development of
artificial reproduction techniques that can free women from their
biology) implies that at some point in time in a woman's life she
was fucking with a man. By saying that the basis of a woman's
powers and the source of feminist revolution is the capacity for
motherhood, you are inextricably linking women to men in this
society, in any revolutionary struggle, and in the future society
of matriarchy that you envision. I think such a theory comes out
of your belief ""that one can be a serious feminist and still live
with and relate to a man and to men,"" a notion which I reject as
totally contradictory and which I hope you will come some day to
reject too. I am linking your notion of mother right so strongly
with heterosexuality because you talk of motherhood in a
future matriarchal society as coming from where it has come from
now and in the past--through fucking with men. The change in
reproduction methods brought on by technology that you only vaguely
refer to, means, at least to me, the possibility of an essentially
motherless and fatherless society; that men and women would
play an equal role, or perhaps even no role, in the creation of a
human being and that society would collectively be responsible
for the embryonic development and upon birth, the nurturing and
raising of the child.

Another sort of major disagreement I have with your letter is
that the whole idea of motherhood and the values of motherhood
as you see them--protectiveness, intuitiveness, adaptability--
sort of makes my stomach turn. I do not feel and cannot relate
to my oppression as a woman in this society as being one of an
inability to raise children. Rather, I feel my oppression at
least partially as being because of that ability and my attempts
to reject the glorification of motherhood that is foisted on me
everywhere and now even with the women's movement. Where does
your idea of motherhood as the moving force of the revolution
leave women, particularly lesbians, who cannot fit into the role
of mother--who both emotionally and intellectually abhor the
thought of bearing and raising children? Where is our place in
this new society?

I want to say something too about the importance of women's
history. The knowledge of the position of women in ancient matriarchal cultures I find very exciting because it gives me a
sense of a history of women as being strong and powerful and controlling--how I envision women in a future society. I think this
knowledge is very important in building a women's movement because it gives women a sense of where we have come from. What
scares me about books like The First Sex is the reaction to it--
that feminists are turning to the concept of matriarchy as being
the new vision or goal of feminist revolution. I think it is a
mistake and even reactionary to transform the basis of ancient
women-controlled societies to that of post-revolutionary society
of the twentieth or 21st century or whenever and to see the same
source of power in ancient cultures as being the source of women's
power today. It scares me because it is coming dangerously close
to accepting values which have been the source of women's oppression for thousands of years and at a time in which we are on
the very brink of being able to do away with that very fact which
has oppressed women for so many years--our ability to bear children.
It is that which you idealize and which I reject. I want to live
in a society in which women are totally free to determine their
lives. I don't want a society in which I am a mother, in actuality
or not, first.

These are some of my thoughts on your article, Jane. I hope
they are of some help to you in thinking out your ideas. Take
care of yourself.

In sisterhood and struggle, B.

MS FIRE

When the rage spreads above my eyelids
in that debilitating form
for a while I don't recognize that
weeping is the last turn inward for my heat.
I forget that it has crept by then
from my community to myself
without burning even the fingers
of those who are the cause of it.

It isn't the tears so much I mind,
but the fact that not long ago
when anger against the women
with whom I work and sleep
was hotter than anger against the cop-callers,
queer-baiters and fuckers of every description,
I flared at the careless word of a friend.

In a cold spring night I fumed,
Learning finally that if I loosen the teeth of a malicious woman
or if I choke, until her eyes pop,
the neck of a slippery-mouthed woman,
I hurt them for our mutual enemies;
learning that if I smolder into a night that burns back
because of a woman I love,
the cop-callers, queer-baiters and fuckers of every description
gather in soft victories.

And so this spring, almost this very day

The fat lesbian bitches

ugly lesbian whores

filthy bull dykes

who fight to clear a living space
that all women will occupy

are freeing us

from the touches and pokes,

the small indignities

we suffered as girls.

Young women will no longer sulk
when little boys pull their hair
or smile when bigger boys

pinch their asses.

They will not make the mistake

of thinking nuisances will go away
if they are ignored.

On your own street

if you do not know

On whose head to bring down

a tire iron,

if you do not, if you cannot
stand with the fat ugly filthy
whores and lesbians

who are drawing overdue blood
then defend them

against the mind bending that
tries to discredit them

for taking offense where
offense was intended.

When even small lines are drawn
give praise to women

who are clearing ground

on which we will all live.

Dear Jane Alpert,

One of the claims that your letter makes is that ruling class males are not going to give us anything we ask for or turn over to us anything we demand. It is that mother right cuts across many important lines, including sex preference. Obviously, there are lesbians who have children, some who want to have children, some who long for them if only the world wasn't the way it is, and some who do not now and never have wanted children. I am a woman from the last group, and I want to try to tell you why your analysis is offensive to me and why I think it is incorrect in general.

The religious fervor of mother right as described in your letter sounds no different to me than the ruling class propaganda about the myth of motherhood. It takes the ideology which grows out of ""biology is destiny"" and attempts to glorify it into ""biology is power."" That is my first gripe. It has a familiar ring--all women will serve as a useful resource in a revolutionary society.

It is cruel to encourage white middle-class women to bear children. I also feel that what you say about the ""few options for meaningful participation"" available to childless women that aren't available to mothers points up a big gap. First, it is clear you are not talking about lower-class women with men and without children. Second, women without children are outside of ""meaningful participation."" Women generally do so after failing to respond to all hints, are at least capable of being mothers. You could as well and as truly argue that all women are potentially lesbians. Class and sex preference are both descriptions that limit possibilities for women, especially when you are talking about a post-revolutionary vision. At present, your analysis neglects to mention the enormous complications that mother right presents regarding institutionalized heterosexuality, men, and male children.

It is idealistic to talk about methods of impregnation without men before women have seized power. I am stunned by your statement that ""Radical feminists are demanding less that women leave men, and suggesting that it might be more effective in building a revolutionary base if women in our experiences."" Further, the demands that you enumerate, about wages, vacations, holidays, research facilities, hospitals, and clinics ""financed by the government"" no less, are idle dreams. In this country, you have been in the field.

Dear Jane,

There are many things in your article that disturb me and make me angry. As I read it, I question these areas of your thought: your concept of revolution, your concept of children, and your concept of womanhood.

To start with the last one first, it is probably obvious that I would have to disagree with you about your projected concept of womanhood because you evidently are still straight and I am a Dyke. There are subterranean hints in your article that indicate a sympathy toward lesbians, and maybe you are moving toward that place yourself, just as you moved from old left heterosexuality to radical feminist (heterosexuality? celibacy? I don't want to guess or try to define you without more words from you). The most glaring example of our differences arises out of your definition of feminist culture's base: “...feminist culture is based on what is best and strongest in women, and as we begin to define ourselves as women, the qualities coming to the fore are the same ones a mother projects in the best kind of nurturing relationship to a child."" I would agree with the ""based on what is best and strongest in women"" part, but as for the rest I strongly take exception. To use as a prototype a mother/child relationship, even the best kind as you describe it, is miles from my experience of valuable relationships with women. As I see it, the only working definition of ""best kind"" that we can come up with in this society (including counter-culture living arrangements of all kinds) is still distant, powerful, one-sided, and oblivious to the deep struggle/love mutuality that can exist between women. Because you rely on the mother/child relationship as basic, you have to take into account the necessary age difference that also exists, and I think it is safe to say that we haven't been able to even begin to bridge the age differences and chauvinism that exist in social relationships today. If you mean some kind of post-revolutionary vision of a mother/child relationship, I still think you are misguided because I seriously question whether post-revolutionary conditions will even embody a mother/child relationship as we think of it now. Later in that same paragraph you say: ""the paradigm for all social relationships (will be) the relationship of a healthy and secure mother to her child."" I contend that ""healthy and secure"" in your statement can only mean some kind of psychological prescription that is already part of the idealistic status quo. (In fact, it sounds a lot like Freud.)

That last quote also brings me to my second point about our differences. What is your concept of children? As reflected in your article (and you don't discuss it, so I can only infer from your usage of words and discussion of motherhood and Mother Right), I would say that you assume something of a children-as-property attitude toward young people. You use the phrase ""a healthy and secure mother to her child"" in the paragraph I mentioned above.

To me, this whole idea is one we have to work against, as we do the concept of the nuclear family, even with the mother as the only nucleus. I don't believe biological mothers should be the pivot point for their biological child's upbringing, and to predicate a theory for revolutionary change on that notion is, I think, a dangerous one. You also say that in your analysis, the source of your personal oppression (do you generalize this?) is: ""the enormous economic, social and psychological obstacles against bearing and raising children of (your) own."" Here again, the mother is defined as having power and control over the biological child. I know it is difficult to have kids in this society, for all the reasons that were pointed out to you by the women you met while traveling around the country. But you are not having kids because you have the power to decide not to put up with that difficulty, and for that you should only be thankful. If you aren't, then I agree with another writer that you are a victim of the glorification of motherhood myth.

Finally, I question the concept of revolution as suggested in your letter. First, it is only suggested, and aside from a couple of references to violent struggle, your strategy seems to lie in basically reformist tactics -- change (by demand) the center of the nuclear family, magically take over scientific research and practice, etc. The system will kill us before anything happens if we rely on that route. Your analogy at the end of your article to the Reformation, rather than the Chinese or Cuban revolutions, as being the process we should think of is again, I think, wrongheaded. (I don't know what you mean by the Christian revolution, and I'm not arguing that the Chinese or Cuban revolutions can give us a pattern either because they were male-dominated.) But you say that the change in consciousness predated the changes in economic and social organization, and will in our struggle too. I can only conjecture about the changes in consciousness that men went through before they smashed the gynocracies that probably existed in prehistory, but I doubt that they came first. As they got more power, they became more piggish, and on and on until the whole shit pile that exists today evolved. But I don't need conjecture to contradict you; both you and I are good examples of the ways our material conditions changed our consciousnesses. It wasn't until you began living in a culture that contained ideas about women's liberation and radical feminism that you were able to deny and contradict the lip service that you were paying to the male left even when you knew it was a sham, as you describe in the account you gave of your distrust of Sam Melville that you submerged when you wrote the introduction to the edition of his prison letters. My example is that I have been having gay relationships since I was 19, ten years ago, but I lived heterosexually in society, even got married, while I was having that constant gay experience, because everything around me reinforced the heterosexual society and the only lesbian I knew was my lover. It wasn't until I met a lot of other Dykes and saw that the lifestyle I was submerging was correct and good that I had the strength to quit the heterosexual world. And I don't think the rest of society is all that different from you and me in that sense...except that they may realize a whole lot quicker than us because of our various privileges that stand or stood in the way of our perception of our self-interest.

Love in the struggle,  
Martha, from the AIAW collective

AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No5_page002.txt,AintIAWoman,,2,"Ten out of thirteen pregnancies

caught my mother's womb

at 18 tender years,

And gave her no rest until they took it away
at 39 tired ones, so she could keep working.
I lost,

Nine lives that she survives

in debt, deeper every year,

and in poor health—

make no mistake about that POOR health.

She gave up what could have been an easier life,
the single life,

for a place in Heaven, and one fucker.

That lost single-ness

and the color of her skin

could have cushioned her after a hard childhood.
But she gave up the first,

in fact, saw no choice... She says:
And in her world the second was the Rule, ""And Grandpa is old before his time.
she could eat, marry, and live in her town, He's sixty-two and it's like he's eighty. 
and be oblivious to the oppression of others. They won't let him work outside anymore.

She's never realized a lot of her own. He's at a desk....shuffling papers,

and he's miserable, he feels useless.
And he's sick—

He can't even have a beer these days.""
What can I say to that painful news?

And she prayed. Grandpa's plight catches my throat,

not out of fear for myself, but him
AND SHE'S STILL PRAYING— and my mother, who's headed that way.

to earn salvation and mercy for her kids and husband, I only mouth a defense of our class,
whom she's condemned countless times. and she doesn't give a shit what I say.
Her older daughters don't believe, really— I realize that she'll defend her life,
and her young children could defect anytime. and fight to change mine.
I keep hoping, and God knows, I'VE TRIED. And she stubbornly plugs on:
""Get a job where you go to work from 9 to 5,
I was her first,
pay your debts, and get some security for the future
and so I'm told, the most trouble. don't kid yourself, things are getting rougher.
He always told me I was the worst, Like be a clerk in a store,
and I hate him, for check-out girls at Eagle's make $3.00 an hour.""
So I tell her that carpenter's apprentices start higher,
and that men have all the job security,
even though all men don't.
My bones and bruises are healed. And I live in another town, besides.
I also won the last fight I had with him.
My mother wants me to make it,

But my sister, fourth in line, is catching the shit, now. and still keep the ethics.
And I can't really ease her pain, but I will stay working-class,
just warn her and hope she fights back sometimes, and I won't have to try.

to ward off hope:
Listen to me, mom.
I love you,
but I love myself and our people, too—
and I don't mean the Mother Church,
or racist, sexist, club-wielding men.
You like music, dancing, and slapstick comics,
I do, too.
You want your kids to eat well,
wear adequate clothing

and be clean.

I never understood class by any name,

But I can see where my consciousness came from.
I resisted staying in the Working Class

until they ripped off my last buck,

and now I'm in debt, too,

without even a year's credit,

and certainly without grace.

My sisters haven't been led on,

and will not make my mistake.

So do I.
I am a feminist and a lesbian,
so my mother and I talk about class now. When I was younger
I thought she'd die if she ever found out about
my life and my politics.
and she sometimes makes bitter comments. Well, she's found out enough to tumble the cathedral,
those goddam prayers.
If I had a nickel for every rosary...
She often berates me because she thinks I pay my debts,
with no respect for anything or anybody.
Once I wanted to change my last name
to her first name.
It only embarrassed her. She says my brains
She didn't understand, and I can't explain.
Maybe I just wanted to get back at the old man. It's hard to get things going,

like the revolution.
It's hard enough to survive
without going crazy for good.
It beats me how women without friends make it.
I tell her I want to be a carpenter, in this world.

She matters to me and my name hasn't changed.

or a printer or a mechanic— beats me where the money comes from

and all she can say is: unless it's from the top.
""You're not built for that kind of work. 
You think you're a real athlete? 
You just want a man's job, that's sick.
When you've got some talent and creativity 
you've got no business digging ditches."" 
And when I say: 
""That's bullshit, and Grandpa works at Goodyear. If he can, so can I.""
I want to."
AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No5_page003.txt,AintIAWoman,,3,"The following is an “Ain't I A Woman?” Message:

Lots of new plans and positions on where-it's-at, where-it-was, what-to-do, how-to-do-it, etc... are coming up in what some may call the women's movement. What we're all hearing is dialogue and arguments between women in our community and in other cities based on the subject matter of books and long essays. Basically, these are *Lesbian Nation* by lesbian Vi e Voice columnist and feminist Jill Johnston; *The First Sex* by Elizabeth Gould Davis and *Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory* by Jane Alpert, a former Weather affiliate and political fugitive feminist. We have been trying to get information and other women's opinions about the issues created by these books, and mostly have been pretty confused and not often satisfied. Only recently it began to dawn that all these new issues are part of an academic haze parading as the going politics and correct direction for lesbians, feminists, and separatists. We have all been arguing and searching for arguments about lesbian nation, mother right, gynarchy, and matriarchy in the name of an idea, and are failing to examine the source and its cover.

*Ain't I A Woman?* has been concerned about finding out about all these new issues so that we could sort out what should be criticized and what should be pursued. We haven't been objectively interested, either; lots of things put us off. Talk and plans of lesbian farms, goddesses, breeding out men, emphasizing culture and art, glorifying motherhood, and other such things all leave some women out in the cold, with their needs consistently ignored. Most of these women are the same women that get fucked over by the racist, male class system, consistently. We are some of those women, and that's where we're at.

We hear about lesbians being pitted against each other over the presence of a male transsexual at their conference (or somebody's conference), and for sure some women are getting fucked over there, and incorrect lines plus repressive tactics mean getting fucked over as much as a male presence does. Women called the Los Angeles conference a lot of things, including the birth of the lesbian nation, which seems presumptuous. What do conscious women expect, anyway, in the middle of a big university campus, under the close, opportunistic eye of the press and with Ronald Reagan's permission? Subversion, division, and exploitation are never accidents, and the state of California is never going to allow the birth of a revolution (which is what we need), let alone finance it and house it. Neither is Random House, Doubleday, Simon and Schuster, CBS, PBS, the Washington Post, or *Ms.* magazine.

We hear about lesbians who have enough money, property, and credit starting to buy land for rural communes and calling themselves ""nations,"" as if the fight has already been won and there is all this ""free land"" for ""free people."" How the fuck do women who are, for the most part, naive city-dwellers, dependent on urban services and the labor of other human beings, expect to handle droughts, insects, flooded fields, and all the other trials and labors of a farmer? With hired hands? Servants? How do these women, even if they learn modern methods and get all that expensive machinery, survive in the face of agribusiness and Nixon's economy? Farmers who are not big-money guys get their crops in and their animals to market with the help of other farmers and sharing equipment. And they suffer harder losses every year until they sell, against their will. There aren't going to be any bunches of lesbians next door, and primitive agriculture will not suffice. Not since the Industrial Revolution has this been possible, and not without the deaths of six billion human beings could it ever be done again, especially considering all the healing this planet needs. Short-sighted separatists determined not to relate to men would die quickly (unless supported by those of us ""sell-outs"" who have to work for a living), though true to their principles, in rural America. The grain elevators, railroads, stockyards, service co-ops, and markets are all owned and controlled by pig, capitalist men. And certainly, these women would be forced to defend ""their"" land and lifestyles against the rural people (who become the police when they are threatened) because isolating oneself totally from oppression can only be achieved by suicide.

Dear women and sisters, I never admitted how much hatred there was there (at school), never admitted my struggle as beginning class. I saw how the college perpetuated in me class values which didn't belong to me. I just wanted to write you to tell you how important *Ain't I A Woman* has been to me. When I first started subscribing, I was in a small women's college in rural New York, had never met or read a lesbian woman, and was having an incredibly difficult time accepting my own gayness though I'd been gay my whole life. Not only did *Ain't I A Woman* put me in touch with anger and sense of oppression, but more than anything else I read clear-headedness, working things out, a sense of commitment, community, joy, even love. That was important, for besides finally admitting and getting in touch with pain and anger, it gave me something to move towards - yes, some lesbians are really, really getting it together - and that gave me courage. I was so, so afraid of moving, but I began to dream of moving out and helping you write the paper, and in the meantime, I came out as the only open lesbian on campus. I faced great hostility, rejection, denial, sex objectification, and built some tenuous, mistrustful relationships with some closeted women who came to me.

I lay awake nights, amazed by what you said, scared I could never be the kind of revolutionary I knew I had to be. You gave me a handle on the revolution, a way I could grab it, grapple with it, use it. I'm in an eastern city now. It's so much nicer being with gay women that the worst struggle seems past, even though the stakes are higher. There are so many gay women here, and such security, and I hadn't realized that the reason I was more restless was that they'd already been through solidarity, that the reason I felt the gay community was because I wasn't a part of it. That's partly true; there still is a need for the solidarity, real communication, and clarity of vision I see in your paper. I'm beginning to talk to women about that, to have the courage and initiative to gather a collective to go deeper than the comfortable place we've been.

I don't mean to idealize you, but I do have profound respect for you. We hear about *The First Sex* and Jane Alpert's new theory and how women are into a return of Matriarchal Rule, goddess worship, honoring motherhood, etc. Many of us cannot relate to ancient history in very many concrete ways, maybe because it's so academic and irrelevant to our lives in the here and now. Motherhood is a frightening and complex thing to glorify. To many women, motherhood only means pain and hardship, and is something to escape, destroy, or at least de-emphasize. Motherhood as a woman's basic identification and role-to-be-respected is part of the heterosexual sexist rap we want to beat. Childcare is an issue for women, and we want to relate to it and deal with it because it is a need of women. However, in lots of cases, being allowed to do childcare, as lesbians, is another trip. Restrictions, rip-offs, and repression are being laid on us by the people who want to glorify mothers and motherhood, be they feminist or lesbian mothers, or state investigators, acting as agents of those who prefer heterosexuality, sexism, and the nuclear family.

We hear about cloning and XY chromosomes and how if women stopped having male children that men would die out in 68 years. It's been said that women have poured energy into our history and our future, but that no one is dealing with the present and the war we need to change things. It would take much longer than 68 years to get women to stop producing male children, unless dykes are talking about taking control of people's lives to institute such a fucked-up priority dream. No men suits us fine, but for a white, middle-class-dominated movement to talk so glibly about exterminating all men is genocidal, because most men and most women are not white and are disenfranchised and oppressed by the ruling classes and governments that were the first to think of killing off undesirables, anyway, including lesbians. We know that women of color who are feminists, lesbians, and separatists are man-haters. We know that poor and working-class white feminists, lesbians, and separatists are man-haters, because we are some of those women. It is not outrageous to hear Third World women condemn the power and pigshit of men of their races. Those women are under those men in this society; white middle-class women are not. The rage of those of us who are working-class against men is real; it is our right. It's painful and infuriating to think of those well-fed women taking pride in beating or murdering, at random, men whose bodies are possibly sick, tired, and weak from being overworked and undernourished. This is not to say that women should not begin making immediate, violent retaliations against male institutions and male attackers, in whatever way we see fit. And it is not to say that we should not kill men if that is what it takes to blast away this shit pile once and for all.

I'm thinking that many women are going to attack or dismiss what is said here as male left ad nauseum, etc., that being such an effective threat against feminists; but I'll wager that most women with their shit together, especially about class or race, will understand exactly what is being talked about. If all this pre-revolutionary energy for genocide were refocused on trying to start the fights that will lead to being able to eat, live, and have the right of self-determination (important idea, there), life'd be bearable. But maybe this energy isn't really energy, but more haze and distraction. It's increasingly obvious that even in the women's movement, even in radical lesbian groups, that poor and Third World women are invisible; we do not exist to the Amazons, artists, Matriarchists, and media-pushers. Women do not have to read *Lesbian Nation* or *The First Sex* to ""know where it's at in the women's movement,"" and should not have to hear any woman tell us we do. Academic and literary world women should not push culture, art, and their intelligentsia standards down our throats. These things are not a part of most women's lives and struggles. Lesbians should not palm off the heterosexual ""mother right"" on other lesbians, mothers, and non-mothers alike.

Coming up with a realistic analysis of things starts with recognizing who we are and what our needs are. All of us, and all of our real needs. Being ""uncultured,"" ""uneducated,"" and isolated from hip trips is not the pitiful life. Being hungry and dependent and sick in our bodies from being denied even minimal unoppressive medical care is the lot of most women and most lesbians and most female children, and these needs should be paramount to revolution-minded dykes. Let's stop eating up media traps and tempting professional interests. Let's find real meat to sink our teeth into, literally.

I respect that you write about your community of women and yourselves, and detail that struggle, because I believe that is the level where politics, action, and revolution are made. I respect you for putting revolution in such a concrete form that I can really grapple with it. I respect you for not compromising what you say. I disagree with people who don't think your paper speaks to those new to feminism. I came to your paper as politically naive as any, and as scared, confused, and self-hating as any, and I saw the clarity of it, and it may have kept me awake nights, but thank god for that. With me at least your paper succeeds in that it helps me clarify directions and goals and stirs me to action. It shakes me up.

I've wanted to write to you a long time, but felt inadequate, inarticulate. Doing tae kwon do has helped me put my anger into good solid fighting and somehow that has helped the words flow. I think I would like to have a relationship with you, writing to and for you as my writing gets better if you want. You can do with this letter what's useful to you, publish it if you want.

I'd like your complete volumes #1 & 2. I've had some of those copies I think, but I keep giving them away to women sitting next to me on buses and so on...

Best of my hopes for you. With deep felt thanks and love,

On June 24 a New Orleans gay bar  
burned up, killing at least one woman  
and 28 men. Most survivors were in-

while many gay people in other cities  
celebrated Gay Pride Week.  

We feel the need to report this  

for two reasons: one, the mass media  
didn't always say it was a gay bar;  
two, it's a horrible manifestation of  
exploitative unconcern by gay bar own-

INTO HISTORY

we DO have a history!

If the silence of the
historians is taken
to mean anything,

it would appear that
one-half of our po-
pulation have been
negligible factors

in our country's his-
tory. (Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Sr. New
Viewpoints in Ameri-
can History, 1922)

Fifty years ago an eminent
male historian called at-
tention to the gross neglect
of women in the standard
interpretations of American
history. It didn't do much
good, did it? How many of us
in the countless history
courses that we were fed in
public school or even college,
ever encountered a woman who
was important? If the authors
of textbooks felt compelled
to mention women, they
brought in two or three appa-
rent oddballs--Carrie Nation,
the temperance worker who
chopped down bars was a favo-
rite--leaving us with the
impression that real, normal
women have never been an in-
tegral part of American history.
This will be a regular
column that will discuss the
history of women in America,
as one way to begin to under-
mine the myth that only men
have had a history. The co-
lumn will take a variety of

forms--short biographies of
interesting women, book re-
views and discussions of the
conditions of women in the
past. Out of this we can
begin to know a little more
about our history.

The column might also
lead us to other questions.
Just what does the history
of women in America involve?
Does it mean rewriting male
WASP history to include

female superstars?

Or perhaps female history
should begin at the opposite
end with an examination of the
history of the family, that
intimate institution in which
most ordinary women have lived
out their lives. But who
was the “ordinary woman""? Was
there ever such a person? Was
she the middle-class leisured
lady or the farm girl hired
to work in the textile mill?
Was she the Southern planta-
tion wife or her house slave?
What were the differences
among American women that
created the variations in the
experience of growing up female
in America? And beyond these
differences, was there a common
experience out of which a
feminist consciousness could
have developed? Did we develop
a female culture alongside
the dominant male culture?
Despite the neglect of wo-
men in the history texts,

there are many isolated books
with which we can begin the
task of putting ourselves back
into history. I will mention
a couple of these each issue.
To begin with, if you want to
get a general, overall picture
of the history of American
women, there are a couple of
good paperbacks out that
should be available at either
Together Books or RIP Bookstore.
Andrew Sinclair's The Emancipa-
tion of the American Woman

(also available in hardback at the
library under the title The
Better Half) is a very readable
history that does a fair job
of dealing with more than just
superwomen and the women's
movement. The Woman in American
History (190 pp.) by Gerda
Lerner is shorter and was writ-
ten as a high school text.
However, it probably gives the
best short, overall picture
presently available.

I hope that this column will
reflect your interests as well
as mine. Please write and let
me know what you would like
me to write about as well as
your reactions to what I've
written. Susan Spragg Jones,

MOVIE REVIEW

Stand Up & Be Counted

The story line is stereo-
typically simple. Three main
characters--one a super-career
woman, one a hassled housewife,
and one a sex symbol married to
a business tycoon make up the
characters. Each, in her own
way, works out her personhood.

I won't dull the movie for you
by going into detail.

I do have strong positive and
negative feelings. One good
thing is that it is clearly
stated that there is no individ-
ual liberation. All women are
in the struggle together. The
movie showed women as strong,
sensitive people, capable of
changing their lives.

The ""bad"" are along the lines
of political criticism. The movie
didn't deal at all with the problems
of consumer capitalism. The women
in the movie are dressed like fa-
shion models, with full make-up and,
one assumes, vaginal deodorant.

The movie implies that, if a woman
wants to be liberated, she can go
out and get a tremendously satis-
fying job making tons of money. (Fat
chance) One of the sub-plots ques-
tions the right of a factory owner
to pay women less than men; it
never questions his right to own

the factory. Etc., etc., etc.

There are moments in the movie
that really embarrassed me with its
clumsiness. The ""consciousness-
raising group scene"" was clearly
made by someone never remotely con-

nected with consciousness-raising.

The movie briefly mentions les-
bians, poor women, older women, etc.,
but one shot on each subject is
hardly “in depth.""

The way Senior Women's Liberation
was handled was degrading. It was
pretty clearly a man's view of older
women.

I think this review is a lot
more negative than is necessary.

For all its faults, I think you
will leave feeling excited and happy.

Even knowing that I was being
co-opted, I loved seeing women be-
ing ""together.""

: varied sources of

reprinted in a newsletter sent to

~~ the wives of interns and residents
in Denver. It's just another ex-
ample of the subtle mystification
of social roles.

The thing that makes a physi-
cian a very special person is his
decision to dedicate himself to
the practice of medicine. Except
for this universal dedication
every doctor is different, just
as every man is different. It is
your adjustment to the individual
doctor who is your husband and
the life you must lead because of
his dedication that will determine
what kind of a doctor's wife you
will be.

A former president of the AMA
has said: ""Nothing is as impor-
tant in shaping a doctor's career
as is his wife and home. The doc-
tor's wife must share his ideal-
ism, appreciate a standard of
values held by no other group and
give him an understanding re-
quired by few. Being a doctor's
wife is both a career and an art.""

In any career or art there are
techniques to be mastered. So it
is with the career of being a doc-
tor's wife. Of the necessary
techniques or qualities, I would
first list unselfishness. You
must learn to be unselfish with

“What is a Doctor? —

(What is a Doctor’s Wife?)

your husband because whether you
like it or not, he belongs first
to his profession. In your in-
nocence when you married him you
probably thought the phrase in
the ceremony ""In sickness and in
health"" meant just you two. You
were wrong for with a physician
it really means the sickness and
health of the whole community.
You must unselfishly share him
with his patients, with medical
meetings and all the other things
that are required of him if he is
to be a good doctor. The very
nature of his profession makes him
public property.

You will understand the need
for patience with your children.
They will not have the insight a-
bout their Dad's preoccupation
with his profession. Your atti-
tude can be most important in
teaching your children to respect
their father's dedication. Your
teaching can make your children
know that their dad does ""good""
for others and because of this he
cannot always be there when his
children want him.

A third quality is self-reli-
ance. You must learn to make de-
cisions yourself--decisions that
other women call upon their hus-
bands to make. You will have to
make decisions about your home,
your children, your attitude to-
ward life; you must lead the home-
front.

These then are some of the
qualifications of a good doctor's
wife--she is unselfish, patient,
self-reliant. A good marriage to
a doctor is partnership. It is
something that both of you will
slave to work at to attain. It
doesn't just happen. The wife
has more than an equal share of
the responsibility to see that
the partnership is a good one. I
am reminded of a passage from
Kahlil Gibran's book, ""The
Prophet"" from the part in which
he speaks of marriage. He says:

You shall be together, But

let there be spaces in

your togetherness

Love one another, but make

not a bond of love;

Fill each other's cup, but

drink not from one cup

Give one another of your

bread, but eat not from

the same loaf;

Sing and dance together

and be joyous, but let

each of you be alone

Though they quiver with
the same music, the
strings of the lute are
alone.

And stand together yet not
too near, For the pillars
of the temple stand apart

And the oak and the cy-
press grow not in each
other's shadow. . .""

Mrs. B.L. Robertson

He might have had the doctor
and his wife in mind when he wrote
those beautiful lines. As a
doctor's wife your first responsi-
bility is to your husband, your

family, your home. You may some-
times rebel against making so
many decisions on your own, a-
gainst so much disciplining of
your emotions but the reward will
be great. What more could you
ask than a contented husband and
happy children?

Fee"
BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page006.txt,BigMammaRag,,6,". . . AND HERE’S TO YOU, MRS. ROBERTSON

:

My first response to Mrs.  
Robertson's article is anger  
mixed with a little sadness, too,  
that another woman would write  
such a sugar-coated, dogmatic,  
sentimentalized, and destructive  
guide to how other women should  
define their existence.

I am a doctor's wife. I do not  
consider it a ""career"" to be  
one. It is a relationship that  
I have with another person who  
happens to be a doctor. As a  
separate individual with my own  
needs, (to grow, to be dedicated,  
to contribute to the community),  
I resent anyone telling me to de-  
fine myself in terms of another  
person and his needs. Mrs.  
Robertson says that I must ""make  
an adjustment"" to my husband and  
the life he has chosen, and that  
that ""adjustment"" will determine  
the kind of life I will lead.

No, thank you, Mrs. Robertson.  
I have my own needs, my own life  
to choose and to create; my life  

is not a series of adjustments in  
my husband's direction. Rather I  
see our life, ideally, as an e-  
qual experience of sharing—of  
giving and taking, and part of  
that sharing is the protesting to-  
gether the medical system that  
denies my being a person in my  
own right and denies my husband  
the same thing.

The medical power structure  
has set it up so that a doctor is  
considered “public property.”

The conflict that the individual  
doctor feels between his public  
life and his private needs stems  
from the irresponsible attitude  
of the medical profession which  
maintains a shortage of doctors  
and a hierarchical structure of  
roles within the medical system  
in its own interest. By mini-  
mizing its responsibility to the  
community, the medical profes-  
sion puts the responsibility on  
the individual doctor who feels  
isolated in this conflict and  
powerless to resolve it. This  
idea that a doctor is public prop-  
erty is part of the mystification  
of what a doctor is—that doesn't  
allow him feelings in dealing  
with his profession, or the choice  
of making his private life as im-  
portant to him as his public life,  
or allow him to make a mistake,  

to admit uncertainty, to deal in  
a human way with the human beings  
he is serving.

Mrs. Robertson, you give me  
three ""qualifications for being  
a good doctor's wife."" Unself-  
ishness is the first one. Like  
most women, I have been raised  
to be unselfish—to put others'  
needs before my own. I have  
found that it is not a virtue to  
be unselfish at all times, es-  
pecially around this issue of  
being a doctor's wife. It is this  
""unselfishness"" that separates  
women who are doctor's wives and  

keeps them from openly sharing  
the pain they experience because  
they and their husbands have been  
indoctrinated into thinking, as  
you say, that “whether you like  
it or not, he belongs first to  
his profession."" No. He belongs  
first to himself and he can de-  
termine the priorities in his own  
life. By accepting this defini-  

tion of medicine being a doctor's  
entire life, we cannot trust our  
own feelings and protest when our  
husbands, as interns and resi-  
dents, are forced to work 100 out  
of 168 hours in a week—when we  
see them exhausted physically and  
emotionally by the pressures of  
work—or when they have invested  
so much time and energy into their  
work that they lose interest in  
other people or even in question-  
ing the very system which is de-  
humanizing them. Perhaps this is  
why so many doctors are seen as  
cold, uncaring, unable to deal  
with their own faults and feel-  
ings. It must be hell to be ex-  
pected to be perfect, dedicated,  
to play God, when you know in-  
side that you are only a human  
being like everyone else.

I want to join with other  
people (doctor's wives, doctors,  
students, other health profession-  
als, etc.) in demanding that a  
doctor's training be a human ex-  
perience—that he and I be given  
time and space to grow in the  
directions we choose for our-  
selves, and have the right to de-  
fine for ourselves what is im-  
portant in our lives at any given  
time. 

Mrs. Robertson, you say I must  
also be ""patient"" to qualify as  
a ""good"" doctor's wife. I am  
patient with my children; I am  
also aware of my impatience with  
them, an impatience which stems  
from knowing that I carry most of  
the responsibility for raising  
them. But I will not lie to them.  
I will not tell them that it is  
my husband's ""dedication to do  
good"" for others which keeps him  
away from them, when I know he  
would rather be sharing his life  
more fully with them—knowing  
them as I know them. I will  
teach them to be impatient with  
the system that makes too many  
demands on their father's time  
and energy. That denies him his  
own needs as a human being. The  
justification for overworking  
doctors is that there is a short-  
age of doctors. True, there is  

a shortage of doctors, but it is  
the medical power hierarchy which  
maintains and encourages that  
shortage in its own interests.

I will also teach my children  
that.

Third, Mrs. Robertson, you say  
that I must be self-reliant.

Part of the strength of being  
self-reliant is knowing what your  
limits are, where your resent-  
ments begin, and what you need as  
a person. I will not ""discipline  
my emotions"" as you suggest, ac-  
cepting without question the role  
of a doctor's wife. I will trust  
my emotions as good indicators of  
what is wrong with the expecta-  
tions that are being made of me.  
Any rebelling against these ex-  
pectations and the system that  
created them, I consider a sign  
of mental health.

I would like to rewrite your  
last paragraph: As a person in  
my own right, my first responsi-  
bility is to myself—to under-  
standing and dealing with my own  
needs and feelings. Only after  
that can I deal honestly with  

anyone else. I will rebel a-  
gainst the structure of the medi-  
cal profession which denies both  
my husband and myself the possi-  
bility of defining ourselves and  
creating our own lives. I see  
my role as a doctor's wife in  
supporting and getting support  
from my husband against that sys-  
tem. What more could I ask than  
to be my own person first, and to  
share that with the people  
closest to me?"

I had a dream last month  
that I'd like to share with you.  
I dreamed I had finally left  
my husband; I passed through  
the door of his house and stood  
outside, where the sun shone on  
the green hills and valleys  
of the world. As I was looking  
around, wondering which house  
I would live in next, I slowly  
formed a question that had  
never been asked before.

""Why do I always have to live  
in some man's house?"" Be-  
cause it suddenly occurred to  
me that women, too, could  
build houses: all they had to  
do was to realize that they  
could.

It wasn't too many years  
ago that women had to depend  
on men for all the necessi-  
ties of life. A woman, single  
or married, generally lived  
with her father, husband, son  
or some other male relative  
or employer. This isn't  
true anymore, of course, women  
can earn their own bread and  
live alone if they please,  
although we are slow to realize  
that this can be a serious  
lifetime choice.

But few people want to live  
alone, and here's where we are  
almost as dependent as ever.  
Women are still forced into the  
feminine role, not by number  
but by loneliness. For the  
one officially sanctioned source  
of closeness for women is  
marriage. Yet marriage (and  
most other couple relation-  
ships) separate us. In exchange  
for intimacy with one man, we  
separate ourselves from every  
one else--by centering our  
lives within single-family  
houses, by taking sole respon-  
sibility for our children,  
by treating other women as  
threats to this one intimacy.  
Men join force with each  
other every day, but for women  
--well, ""divide and conquer""  
really works.

My dream was firmly  
rooted in my waking life,  
because I did leave my  
husband last fall, and I have  
indeed been trying to move  
out of my man-centered  
thinking and find my  
own way of living in the  
world. I've been in a  
good place for changing and  
growing, because I've been  
living in a community (Insti-  
tute Mountain West) which  
is not male dominated, and  
which provides much of the  
closeness I need without  
requiring the emotional  
tradeoffs that usually ac-  
company couple relationships.  
As a result, I now take  
communal living very seriously  
as a base for people learning  
to exercise their own  
strength. And particularly  
for women, who have been  
separated for so long and  
are now finding their  
strength through solidarity  
with each other.

For me, the difficulties  
in building a house for my-  
self have been psychic; fears  
(would our families and  
friends reject me?), uncer-  
tainties (could I really  
take care of myself?), guilt  
trips (what would this do  
to the children?). For many  
women, there are also practi-  
cal difficulties--full-time  
child care, no place to live,  
no money, no job skills.  
These problems can be para-  
lyzing for a woman alone.  
They can be overcome by women  
together.

So: a proposal. I would  
like to see a communal house  
in Denver for women only, a  
house whose main purpose is  
giving support to women who  
are trying to restructure their  
lives. Practical support;  

a place to live cheaply by  
sharing space and possessions,  
maybe temporarily free by  
sharing income. The opportu-  
nity to cooperate with sisters  
in child care. Maybe job  
sharing, or a job coop for  
part-time work. And psychic  
support; living with sisters in  
a community that encourages  
openness. Sharing our strug-  
gles, one to one or in groups,  
with other people who know  
what we're talking about.

Knowing that we aren't alone.

I see this house as a base from  
which women would have the  
chance to explore new living  
possibilities, and to feel their  
strength as women and  
with women. It would seem  
natural for this house to have  
shared child care for the resi-  
dents; it might also serve as  

a permanent home for a coop  
nursery school. Perhaps  

space for a women's center, a  
library or clinic?

There is some money avai-  
lable for this project; it  
should be possible to make a  
down payment on a building  
and, instead of pouring rent  
into a capitalistic landlord's  
pocket; liberate it in the form  
of a land trust permanently  
owned by the women who occupy  
it.

A lot of people have ex-  
pressed interest and support  
for this idea. What is needed  
right now is a few women who  
share my commitment to com-  
munal living, who would con-  
sider actually living in the  
house for several months and  
putting at least part-time  
time and energy into it. If  
that sounds like you, I'd like  
to hear from you. I can be  
reached at the Institute, 2096  
Emerson Street, or phone  
573-6394.

I see the article in Women,  
Vol. 2, No. 4, on the Philadel-  
phia Women's Transition House  
for a more detailed discussion  
of this idea.

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page009.txt,BigMammaRag,,9,"motherhood. ..

I want to write a journal about  
myself as a woman and as a mother,  
to explore my thoughts in a deeper  
and more coherent way. I also want  
to share my own struggle because if  
I had been able to read something  
like this, I would never have felt  
so isolated and full of self-hate  
and doubts.

I think being pregnant and giving  
birth and then motherhood are  
very different experiences. For  
example, before finding out I was  
pregnant, I fantasized about being  
pregnant and giving birth and nursing.  
I didn't think about what it would  
mean on a day-to-day basis. Mo-  
therhood was so undifferentiated  

and idealized as a glorified state  
of being, as something I magically  
became; it got very confusing as I  
struggled to define how the ideal  
fit into my daily experiences.

After my second wedding anni-  
versary, I found out I was preg-  
nant. A diaphragm baby—a dia-  
phragm used carelessly because,  
well, I believe I wanted to have a  
baby. We more or less planned to  
get pregnant in a year or two's  
time.

As soon as I left the clinic,  

waiting for David to pick me up and—  

to tell him, I cried. I felt  
cheated because I had always looked  
forward to deciding consciously to  
get pregnant. I felt like a fail-  
ure because I saw myself as some-  
one who had control over such mat-  
ter-of-fact processes as birth con-  
trol. I also realized that David  
and I would no longer be totally in-  
dependent and without responsibili-  
ties. One reason for putting off  
getting pregnant was that I wanted  
more time alone with David.

It was really a matter of timing.  
On one hand, David and I figured  
there was never a perfect time.  
There was always something else to  
do—travel, education, work. On the  
other hand, ""if not now, when?""

I always thought I would get  
pregnant after I got my career to-  
gether. We had fantasies of each  
of us getting half-time jobs while  
we had babies so we could share in  
their care, and taking turns working  
once the children (notice the plu-  
ral form) were older. Well, there  
I was, a first-year graduate student  
in Sociology at Berkeley, and I knew  
that I was not going to be a profes-  
sor one day. I was not going to

The development of this one woman's mind and feelings over a  

two-year period and many of her conclusions made in the latter parts of the journal

in six parts. This is Part One.

woman and a mother.

While in Berkeley, California, one of the women working on BIG MAMA met the woman  
who wrote the following journal, and brought it back to Denver for other women to  

It is a very long, thoughtful journal relating the concrete experiences of  

have one of those careers or be a  
traditional academic woman. Yet no  
alternate lifestyles appealed to  
me—regular movement politics or  
hippy hang loose. I wanted to do  
some meaningful work, but was con-  
fused about what kind of work to  
get into.

So there I was, dissatisfied with  
my work and vaguely figuring I  
could get some kind of fulfillment  
out of parenthood.

Now, two years later, obviously  
due a large part to being a mother  
of a 17-month-old girl, I see a  
career, travel, and education dif-  
ferently. My career will be inti-  
mately involved with the women's  
movement; I am more into internal  
journeys than travel to other lands,  
and I see my formal education in a  
much more utilitarian fashion—I  
use it to get a job (I am a teach-  
ing assistant), and will use a pro-  
gram to be trained in a skill if  
it is expedient.

But I am getting ahead of myself.  
I hadn't considered much about ac-  
tual motherhood—the caretaking and  
responsibility for a child or in-  
fant. Pregnancy and birth were the  
center of my fantasies as I thought  
about and decided to remain preg-  
nant.

I think at this point more de-  
tails of my personal biography are  
relevant. This was February 1969.

I had heard about women's libera-  
tion and welcomed it wholeheartedly  
as very relevant to my life. When  
I married, I thought I legally had to  
change my name. I did, and hated  
being Mrs. Him. When I arrived in  
Berkeley, I changed back to my mai-  
den name. I realize it is my fa-  
ther's name, but it was me for 22  
years and I never felt like I was  
Mrs. David Him.

I went through bureaucratic and  
emotional hassles doing that change.  
I felt like a lonely fanatic.  
""What's in a name?"" is the message  
I got from my circle of leftish  
male graduate students. From David  
I got passive support. From the  
straight world at the University I  
got expressions of unbelief and  
hostility. From women friends I got  
tacit support, but many wondered if  
it was worth the hassle. But I had  
to do it for my state of mind. I  
did it in some slightly devious ways  
because I didn't have the energy or  
support for honest confrontations.

That Fall, I sought out a women's  
liberation small group. I went to  
two different ones. One had been  
going on and I felt I needed to be  
in one from the beginning. The next  
was composed of women connected to  
Berkeley male political heavies. It  
was very in-groupy and I felt left  
out. So I didn't go back. But I  
read available literature and saw  
my marriage as being liberated. I  
saw it like that for a couple of  
reasons. I no longer was Mrs. Him,  
and I shared the household tasks  
with my husband. I was unaware  
that I still felt and acted on the  
total responsibility for that work.  
In the Fall of 1968, I believed I  
had an equalitarian marriage, that  
when we had a child we would con-  
tinue being equal in child care.

So when I found out I was preg-  
nant, I used to say ""we"" are preg-  
nant. We planned to share the ex-  
perience in as total a way as we  
knew how.

I got into being pregnant. I  
had always looked forward to that  
time as one of joy and beauty. I  
didn't feel I was creating a being  
really. I used to tell people, ""It  
is creating itself."" I dug the  
changes in my body; it was a groovy  
physical experience. I read books  
about the natural process of preg-  
nancy. I found another woman who  
was pregnant and we shared experi-  
ences, pains and aches, doctor stor-  
ies and information on natural"
BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page010.txt,BigMammaRag,,10,"childbirth. I loved to watch the  
changes in my body and to fantasize  
about the growth of a human being  
going on right inside me. I felt  
for the first time in years that my  
body really looked beautiful, and I  
got positive feedback about that  
from friends. It was a happy and  
exciting time for David and me.  
When I look back I can see some  
things I was blind to. What I  
thought was sharing being pregnant  
wasn't really sharing at all.  
While the baby was going to be ours  
in a real way, I was the one who  
desperately needed another woman to  
talk to. I was the one avidly read-  
ing pregnancy books. David read  
sections I suggested in various  
books, but he didn't feel the ab-  
sence of an expectant father to  
share with. When you get down to  
it, I, not we, was biologically  
pregnant. When the Third World and  
People's Park crises came, I stayed  
home to protect the unformed child  
inside me and David did battle in  
the streets.  

When I was seven months pregnant  
we moved into a house in Oakland  
with another couple and a single  
woman. We wanted to live communal-  
ly and literally took the plunge—  
barely knowing the other people.  
But dare to struggle, dare to win,  
and after all, we could always  
split if things didn't work out.  

About two weeks before the due  
date we waited in a time feeling  
that is very definitely one belong-  
ing to pregnancy—a feeling of days  
being epochs—a time feeling Doris  
Lessing captures so well in A Prop-  
er Marriage. At last labor began.  
It was slow and long. I spent a  
day at home and we kept saying, ""Is  
it really happening now?""  

I was well trained in the pro-  
cess of natural or prepared child-  
birth, and David and I made a very  
good team of breather and coach/ti-  
mer. He was really there for me,  
helping me keep in control of the  
wave of each contraction. We are  
both excellent students and had  
learned our lessons well.  

The whole birth experience was  
one of joy and pain. It was a  
physical and emotional high unlike  
any I had ever experienced. ""Pain  
and pushing and feeling relieved,""  
I wrote in my journal. David got  
tears in his eyes when I was final-  
ly dilated and started to push; I  
was totally involved in the physi-  
cal process with no energy to re-  
flect. How rare for me not to al-  
ways be watching and analyzing with  
my inner eye. David and I felt we  
were sharing a unique and loving  
moment.  

For many reasons the hospital  
stay was a downer. Mainly because  
immediately after the birth, I was  
separated from David. Once I knew  
Amanda was a girl who was perfectly  
formed physically, my main desires  
were to be with David and share our  
news with family and friends. But  
I was left alone in a crowded hos-  
pital. The nurses were hassled  
and bothered. I saw David three  
hours in total during the two days  
before I finally got rooming-in.  
After great protest and maneuvering  
I was put into rooming-in with  
three other women. Rooming-in  
means the babies and fathers are  
with you all day. My one night  
there I felt isolated from the oth-  
er women. They said things I  
couldn't identify with, which  
freaked me, like ""I was my hus-  
band's bride, now I'm his son's  
mother."" Discussions about endless  
shopping for the perfect crib and  
clothes went on. They told how  
being pregnant was their secret and  
how each decided the right moment  
to let her husband in on it. They  
each told their stories not really  
listening to the other women,  
waiting for the polite moment to  
relate their trip. I had enough  
consciousness then not to blame or  
put down those women. What this  
experience was for me, I wasn't  
sure; I was clearer about what it  
was not.

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page011.txt,BigMammaRag,,11,"LESBIAN 0010 YOU ?

I said I would write an article
about ""Gay Women"" for Big Mama and
since I happen to be one, (a Gay
Woman that is) I guess that's ap-
propriate. What does the word
Lesbian do to you? I know what it
used to do to me. It would bring
to mind imagery and words such as:
women in men's suits, perversion,
butch, insecurity and a threaten-
ing feeling. It still means that
for many people. Actually, the
word Lesbian has a long history.
The word stems from an old myth
about a group of very fierce Amazon
women who saw nothing wrong with
loving one another and developed
strong primary groups without men.
Their culture glorified women
loving women. These women lived
on the isle of Lesbos and from
there we get the derivative
""Lesbian.""

Now to get to the concept of
Lesbian as it is for me and as
other people see me as a Lesbian.
A good many of the straight women
I know who used to be warm and
friendly have become cool and a-
loof, and as uninvolved as possible
now that they know I'm gay. I
think that I might raise some
doubts in their minds about their
life-styles and relationships with

men. I, also at some point, have
felt bisexuality intellectually to
be the ideal way for people to
exist, but on the reality level, I
feel that it's about as realistic
as asking for Utopia in Hell. I
also feel that sexuality labels
are degrading and limiting, but
are very necessary for the ways in
which people relate to each other
at this point. I personally can't
stand labels: heterosexual, bi-
sexual, homosexual. It shouldn't
make a difference but unfortunately
it does, and that's the situation
we're forced to deal with.

Men who see me as a Lesbian see
me as a challenge. Liberal men
want to get down to my basic human
spirit, and want me to prove to
them that I'm not really a castrat-
ing bitch. They're perfectly will-
ing to give me the chance. Fuck
it, if you'll pardon the expres-
sion, I'm tired of explaining my-
self to men. I'm tired of apolo-
gizing for feelings of anger, rage,
pain and hatred, that were placed
in me by men. I'm tired of ex-
plaining the dehumanizing destruc-
tion of my soul, my inner being,
me, to men who exclaim, ""Well,
Honey, that wasn't me, that was
some other male chauvinist pig,""

or, ""It's not me, it's the power
structure. I'm just a working
class pawn...true, I'm more privi-
leged than you, but honest I don't
have a God-Damned thing to do with
the mess women are in."" The same
men will turn around and mess me
over on perhaps just a higher in-
tellectual level than the rest of
the Male Chauvinist Pigs. I've
finally decided that I have to
focus my anger on the people who
deserve it or destroy myself. The
battle is not over yet, and, by
God, I intend to win.

I enjoy determining who I am,
what I want, and I enjoy having
support from Lesbian sisters who
understand where I'm coming from,
recognize the enemy, and no longer
have to spout lies and make ex-
cuses for men. I enjoy loving and
being loved by women spiritually
and physically. I'm beginning to
think that Lesbians are the only
non-masochistic women in our so-
ciety. How can you conquer an op-
pressor when you sleep with him
every night? Yes, I did say con-
quer, the only way women are going
to obtain liberty is to take it.
As long as we relate to men and
they maintain positions of relative
power, we will continue to enforce
their positions in the status quo.

PARK HILL WOMEN'S CENTER

Talked to a friend of mine
the other day. She told me I
should go check out EVERYWOMAN,
a women's center in Park Hill.
So off I trucked, finding myself
(once I got there) in the midst
of a morning tea, with crafts
being sold to raise money for
the center. Most of the women
at the center seemed to be
young mothers. The child-care
center took care of the little
ones. EVERYWOMAN seems to
be a women's center with great
possibilities. For more infor-
mation, call 377-0847. The
address: 2390 Birch.

Perhaps putting an article
in this paper seems like a
strange way to say goodbye
to two of the people you have
lived with for over a year.
In one sense it's the only
way I can share the unique
love I have for two people so
much younger than I, and yet
from a very selfish perspec-
tive, it's really the only way
I can share it with them. For

I am sure that when the real-

ity of their leaving has

packed the last suitcase in

the trunk, and the pillows

and blankets in the back seat
have arranged themselves around
the toys, and the busy work

is over and awkward hands fum-
ble for something to do—

when all the ""drive safely's""

and ""write soon's"" have been
said 3 times... that when

it really comes time, a hug
that's a little too hard

and a kiss that's a little

too long, will have to suffice

for the words that suddenly
become nothing but tears.

To those of you who
question the effect of col-
lective living on children,

I ask you to instead

marvel at the possible effect
of children on a collective
of ""grown-ups."" To those

of you who imagine that all
radical collective conversa-
tions revolve around home-made
bém ingredients and lurid
sexual activity, I ask you

to consider the effect of
Tommy riding horsey on your
leg during a meeting, or
Rainey's request for the

house to buy more bananas.

To those of you who be-
lieve that all young radicals
relate impersonally to a
Revolution that would destroy
all that you deem sacred, I
ask you to take into consi-

deration the sleepless nights

we have all spent measu-

ring the ways we unconscious-

ly manipulate children, and
the early-morning house

meetings that have talked

themselves far into the late
afternoon about still un-
answered questions. And they
are good questions to be
asked and I hope we keep on
asking and trying.

Tommy and Rainey—I hope
you understand this pen-to-
paper cop out.

It'll be much easier for
me to have you read the good
things I feel for you, than
to look you in the eye and say
them, knowing that, given the
chance, I would probably
hurt you many times. And
once again I take the chance
of laying a trip on you.

Oo Miny vid

Maybe you'll think this is
all pretty silly and that

all I had to do was come and
tell you I really like you,
and maybe spend the afternoon
in the park. And you're
probably right—if that's
what you're thinking—but...

I guess I'd like you both
to know that the night we
spent reading the ""Little
Prince,"" wrapped in a sleeping
bag on my balcony, or the
time in the middle of summer
we pretended a snowstorm had
hit and put on our winter
coats and went to the park
to battle the winds, and the
night we celebrated the
completion of my loft with
a “loft party,"" or even
the night we tried to fake
one of our singing, guitar,
harmonica parties with instant
hot chocolate and Tommy refu-
sed to drink it 'cause it tasted
like warm water—that those
times were as fun and impor-
tant to me as the good times
I had when I went out and
you couldn't, or when I
stayed up and you had to go
to bed.—And that having
chocolate marshmallow
cookie crumbs in my bed
was really not as frustrating
as I made it out to be.

Aside from all the times
we obviously enjoyed each
other, there were many mo-
ments when I silently
comforted myself in your
friendship. Thinking at
times that you two alone
allowed me the total free-
dom I needed to find and
enjoy the lost pleasures of
my being. I never told you
that of course, first be-
cause at the time it
seemed unnecessary to put it
into words, and secondly
because I guess it seemed
ridiculous for a 25-year-
old woman to tell two ""kids""

7 and 9, that she appreciated
and needed them.

It seemed ridiculous then,
but through you two and the
times we've spent together

I'm beginning—just begin-
ning—to understand and
learn exactly what it means
to be a child in a society
where you are made into a
separate class of people.

A class where adults pro-
ject their myths and define
your childhood, where your
privileges are handed out
and taken away by those

who maintain control over
you (much like the Rich

vs. the Poor), where you are
told, perhaps often, that
being loved requires a
certain behaviour also dic-
tated to you by adults.

But amidst the confusion
I have seen your strength and
I envy and admire it. And so—
to you Rainey, whose earned
sarcasm and intelligence
will not allow me to project
my ego on the myth of your
childhood—I hope to devote
a good portion of my conscious-
ness to your ideas of libera-
tion.

And to you Tommy, whose
bluntness will never cease
to ring truth in my heart, I
lend an unbending ear to
the creative mechanics
that puts cardboard wheels
on beer cans and is capable
of fantastically complex
a.m. art work over a bowl of
Frankenberry cereal.

It's a new field of love
for me and it's sort of
frightening. If I get a little
lost in my exploration I'd
appreciate a helping hand.
And hopefully there will be
times when our understandings
will be so close that we may
just spend the whole after-
noon in each other's laps.
Thank you, Tommy and Rainey,
for not allowing me to con-
trol you and for giving me
a chance to love you—your
way. It's much freer than
anything I have to offer."

PRESS ROOM

I asked myself why I was so enraged, and so profoundly embarrassed, by the photographs of the interior of the press room at the County Courthouse. I have seen pictures of nude women before, in what I consider to be degrading and humiliating poses. And I am

certainly no longer surprised to find instances of sexism in every aspect of our society. Why, then, does this example of overt male chauvinism affect me more deeply than some others? I think it is because of the specific circumstances—first, because it was in the county courthouse, a place where both men and women work all day, go in and out, etc. What does a woman feel who has to work in such an atmosphere? Secondly, these degrading photographs were in the press room, a place where people intimately involved with the media and news coverage work. It makes me cringe to think of what these men think of me, as a woman, and then to expand that to think of what the attitude of this country's media network is toward women in general. The same men who put up those pictures are the men who have, at their fingertips, access to the news media that can sway public opinion to a great degree. The tone and/or bias of their reporting can help to make or break the women's movement.

I ask myself why feminism is

‘Press,’

Carof

always distorted by the media, why half-nude women are on T.V. selling shaving cream or toothpaste, why the women's movement is portrayed as a bunch of howling, bra-burning, castrating women. Now the answer to that question becomes clearer—just look at the

men who are writing those stories!

My mirror reflects more than my image

Your cheekbone casts the only shadow that I've allowed myself to rest in, for some time now.

Photos by Pingela Mason

And the shade of your mouth, as it speaks, even umbrellas my thoughts... and my life becomes a turned down turned round inside out umbrella drowning in its own secretive joy.

My most unspoken thoughts have sought refuge in the folds of your expression and I've spent many estranged nights in the negative space against your neck.

I say to myself, in defense, of course I'm only resting here—just for a time you understand... 
Resting here, 

in the shadows of your being

And perhaps I should have told you I was here.

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page014.txt,BigMammaRag,,14,"Before and After

In doing political work, I have  
found myself in situations where it  
has always been very easy for me to  
remain passive—to prefer others,  
“especially men, to do the work that  
I was too insecure or self-  
conscious to do. I have always  
known ""which side I was on,"" but I  
have not always been so sure of the  
reasons why. Never having had much  
practice at actually analyzing sit-  
uations myself, I was therefore  
very impressed (and intimidated) by  
people who could develop complex  
analyses and intellectualizations  
of different situations. This, of  
course, played right into my pas-  
sivity, my willingness to accept  
someone else's theory, my insecuri-  
ty in putting forward my own. Now,  
I am beginning to feel much better  
about myself and I have more confi-  
dence in my abilities to think, and  
this carries over into my relation-  
ships with others. I know that I  
have to PUSH myself to do those  
things that are important to do—  
to participate, to be active—even  
if I may feel terribly uncomfor-  
table and awkward. One of the most  
important factors in this is the  
support I get from my sisters.

Support Raises Consciousness

This support not only makes me  
strong enough to speak out in  
groups and contribute my opinions,  
but I find that it becomes easier  
to do the kind of reading and re-  
search necessary to enable me to  
raise my political consciousness to  
the point where I think it should  
be. It isn't hard anymore to admit  
my ignorance without shame, be-  
cause I know that I have the  
strength to do the self-education  
necessary to remedy that ignorance.  
I feel oftentimes that men are re-  
sentful of this kind of obvious  
strength. I understand that reac-  
tion, but it is only an example of  
the sexism which is in all of us.  
Most of us have learned to be  
threatened by people who are  
strong, who could be potential  
""competition.""

These kinds of hostile, uptight  
reactions are balanced by the  
patronizing, ""older brother"" atti-  
tudes of some other movement men.  
It is almost as if they merely  
tolerate my sympathies with THEIR  
ideas—it makes me feel like a  
movement groupie. And it is an  
obvious indication that those men  
do not consider my political com-  

mitment and understanding to be any-  
where near as serious as their own.

This brings up a question which  
has been especially significant to  
me in dealing with ""hip"" or ""move-  
ment"" men: the question of integra-  
ting my sexuality with my intellect.  
I consider myself a political person,  
and also a sexual person. It has  
been possible for me a number of  
times to have truly meaningful rela-  
tionships with men—relationships in  
which little was hidden, thoughts  
were shared and expressed honestly—  
but these were rarely sexual rela-  
tionships. The most egalitarian ex-  
periences I have had with men were  
not physical at all. And in the  

same way, the sexual relationships I  
have had with men were rarely able  
to develop into anything deeper  
without being extremely sexist—in  
other words, my role in the rela-  
tionship had already been defined in  
a purely sexual way. So, a problem  
arises—in order to keep myself out  
of exploitive situations, I find  
myself continually denying my sexu-  
ality—negating my womanhood in or-  

der to function effectively with men.

I ignore my physical feelings as  
best I can—I have consciously de-  
cided that it is actually safer and  
much less hassle to avoid sexual re-  
lationships with men, at least for  
the time being.

People Change Slowly

I understand that people change  
slowly, and that's why I'm waiting  
and struggling with the people I  
love. But it also makes me very  
angry to constantly try to act dif-  
ferently than I feel—to be unable  
to really be the warm, open person I  
know I can be, because I know people  
don't understand that in the way  
that I mean it. So, I have to be  
cautious. It just isn't worth it  
anymore to make love with a man and  
have it end up the way it usually  
does—with a huge space between us  
afterwards—the cold feeling when I  
realize that suddenly the prelimin-  
ary closeness, the meaningful talk  
is over, because he's finally  

fucked me. And all of the mech-  
anisms I use to keep myself from  
dwelling on the shittiness of it  
all, my rationalizations, my over-  
looking of things he said and did—  
they don't work anymore. I like my-  
self too much now—I respect myself  
and care for myself and I WON'T LET  
IT HAPPEN ANYMORE! So, for now, al-  
though I will work on building hon-  
est relationships with men, I must  
be sure that the sexual aspect is  

as honest as the intellectual.

This brings up another question  
which I have done a lot of thinking  
about recently—that of bisexuality  
or gay relationships. As I become  
more conscious of my womanhood, it  
becomes more difficult for me to  
submit myself to a heterosexual re-  
lationship in which I am uncomfor-  
table or in which I see even the  
most subtle sexist patterns. But  
at the same time, my need for sex-  
ual contact, my sexual frustration,  
continues. And I find that the  
only people I can completely trust  
are the few women I have come to  
love. Because I know that they  
are honestly struggling with their  
sexuality and that they consider  
dealing with sexism (in themselves  
as well as in others) as an ongo-  

ing process that must be integra-  
ted into their everyday existence.  
So it becomes increasingly easy  
for me to think of making love to  
a woman—in fact, that doesn't  
seem at all threatening compared  
to becoming sexually involved with  
a man. It's quite a change for  
me. Until recently I hadn't even  
considered bisexuality, and now in  
many ways it is much more attrac-  
tive than heterosexuality. I'm  
not saying I will cease to be at-  
tracted to men, not at all; just  
that I am now feeling comfortable  
about physical relationships with  
women also.

So what does all this mean? I  
cannot at all see myself with-  
drawing from men completely. I  
live with men, my political work  
must necessarily involve and in-  
clude men. There are a few men  
whom I truly love and trust to a  
large degree. But I know that  
all men—and women too—have a  
thousand subtle, deep-seated  
feelings about each other—  
feelings that we cannot even iden-  
tify, that color our actions in  
ways we haven't even imagined.

And I feel that these feelings op-  
erate most strongly and subcon-  
sciously in those situations that  
are based in emotions and in those  
situations in which we have had  
the least practice at being open  
and honest. Sexual matters are  
the perfect examples of this.

Our society has taught us to be se-  
cretive and non-communicative  
about sex, let alone being embar-  
rassed and ashamed. We cannot  
talk to each other or learn from  
each other. We come together in  
bed and operate from two separate  
points—apart. How can we expect  

to communicate at that stage of the  
game, without any real preliminary  
honesty that deals specifically  
with sex? What I mean is that 99%  
of the time, men whom I sleep with  
are bound to be operating from a  
self-centered position—and nec-  
essarily so—because we probably  
have not been able to deal effec-  
tively with all of the quiet pri-  
vate thoughts, fears, and hang-ups  
we each have about our bodies and  
sex. So, men (and women, too) in  

a sexual relationship will be ac-  
ting out a lot of emotional, large-  
ly irrational responses. Where in-  
tellectually, many people can  
recognize and struggle with sexist  
feelings, in a sexual relationship,  
which is largely emotional, this  
might not be possible.

I am by no means advocating the  
increased intellectualization of  
personal relationships. I am an  
emotional person. What I mean is  
that we must really try to under-  
stand our emotions, our spontaneous  
responses to situations and people.  
And this is very hard—much more  
difficult than changing one's mind  
about a political matter or an in-  
tellectual decision. It goes to  
the very root of how we function as  
human beings, and how we relate to  
others. This is what I see as the  
true struggle—the radical struggle—  
the willingness to examine and deal  
with those very things that govern  
our every moment of existence. 13"

THE BELL JAR

Emotional deterioration of the women
around her, the limited roles they
are confined to. She seeks something
different and is told that she must
become a super-woman, make herself
somehow different from “all those
other women"" and yet still channel
her talents into a restricted mold.

SYLVIA PLATH died on a Monday morning
around 6:00 A.M. She went downstairs
into the kitchen and left

a plate of bread and butter and a
jug of milk for her children.

Then she opened the oven door,

turned on the gas, and laid her

head down.

Her book ""The Bell Jar"" is widely acclaimed now, and her two books of
poetry, ""Colossus"" and ""Ariel"" are
a common sight in all bookstores. 

Still - I wonder how many of her
readers have the power over her life that
will allow her to end the nightmare
that an analytical perceptive
realistic mind shows her daily.

She decides to commit suicide.
Suicide, the last attempt at self
determination, real control over one's
life, a desperate and liberating act.
She is thwarted in her attempt and
describes the hell she underwent in
being forcibly rehabilitated. Esther
was a rebel defeated, and one finds
herself wishing she had won the battle
then, rather than suffer the ten more
years of forced compliance Sylvia did
before she liberated herself from the

mornings began with the hope that
someone might understand, and how
many years of disappointment accumulated
in the process of her life.
Do not just read her book and say
you understand. For unless it
moves you beyond tears and into
some kind of action, your intro-
verted understanding will be of no
use. Do not read her poems and cry,
rather read them with the same anger
with which they were written. And
realize that unless things change,
or until we change things, I can
guarantee you that one of your
friends, my friends, our friends,

will surely do the same one day. The
""Bell Jar"" is an autobiographical
novel written by Sylvia Plath about
herself in her 20th year of life. 

This young woman who gets slapped
in the face with the reality of
life and what happens to talented
women in our society. It is time to change the picture of reality
now and it was reality in the 50's. Sylvia, speaking through

Esther in the book, sees the

Emory vs. C.U.

In the Fall of 1971, 333 women
and 2,524 men applied for admiss-
ion to C.U. Med. School. The
school accepted 18 women and 117
men. Women made up the 14% min-

ority and men made up the 86%
majority of the 1971 class.

Ms. Emory was one of the 315
women who were not accepted, and
she did not sit back and view her
rejection with apathy. She filed a
Sex Discrimination Suit against the
University of Colorado Medical
School.

The suit came to trial in the Fall
of 1972, Judge Mitchell B. Johns
presiding, with Martin P. Miller
representing Ms. Emory in the suit.

Two months later Judge Johns
had finally reached a decision.

His verdict echoed almost
word for word C.U.’s Defense Stat-
istics and Logic used in the trial.
He admitted that women are under-
represented in Medical Schools,
but said that C.U. Med. School has
a better representation of women
than most schools.

Angela (another B.M.R. reporter)
and I interviewed Ms. Emory follow-
ing the trial. She had several things
to say to us in regard to the trial.

One of the most important things
she pointed out was the use that C.U.
Med. School made of the ""Equal
Rejection Theory."" The ""Equal Rejec-
tion Theory"" was used through the
courts for many years; it was used
as a basis for discriminating against

racial minorities. Most courts today
refuse to recognize it as a basis for
racial discrimination.

""Equal Rejection"" is based on
separating the number of applicants
into different groups, i.e. black,
white, male, female. C.U. Med.
School separates their applicants in-
to groups of male and female. The
figures they use are the percentage of
applicants accepted from each group.
C.U.'s statistics show that out of
2,524 male applicants, 107 were accep-
ted, a percentage of 4.24 acceptance
of male applicants. Out of 333 female
applicants, 18 were accepted, a per-
centage of 5.4 of the total female
applicants.

When the class make-up is viewed
in this manner, the real class make-
up of 14% women and 86% men is
obscured.

Ms. Emory was also subjected to
interviews at C.U., where questions
were asked about her children's care.
She was asked (about her housekeeper)
""Is she mentally capable of taking care
of your children?"" Another woman app-
licant was asked ""Who'll be the Chief
Cook and bottle washer if you go to
Medical School?"" Ms. Emory wondered
how these questions could possibly
affect their qualifications for entrance
to Medical School.

Ms. Emory was also interviewed by
two psychologists as part of her entrance
requirements. (It is questionable whether
male applicants are submitted to these
interviews.) One hour-long interview
provided C.U. with a negative psychol-
ogical assessment of her potential suc-
cess in Medical School. A second hour

Ms.
appealed to a higher court. The local

courts have bowed to the political pressure
and bigotry which rules the Medical Profess-
ion. A woman of the caliber of Ms. Emory will fight all the
way to the Supreme Court and win.

board of admissions.

Although Judge Johns has ruled against

Emory, the case will no doubt be

Much as I like this series,
however, I sometimes have
trouble with the second state-
ment. First, it tends to mis-
lead us into thinking of women's
history as always, everywhere
the same: women's history e-
quals oppression. Second, we
have to be careful in looking
for antecedents to our own
struggle. Women's ""struggle for
freedom"" did not occur as fre-
quently nor in all the places
one might expect.

For example, the history of
17th and early 18th century wo-
men, particularly the Protestant
women of English descent, should
be approached on its own terms.
If it is forced into the 19th
and 20th century categories of
oppression and liberation, we
only confuse ourselves.

Let us look at the 17th and
early 18th century women. What
exactly would oppression have
meant for these colonial women?
Certainly the attitudes ex-
pressed by literate men about
women left something to be de-
sired. Woman, according to a
very long tradition, was a weak
creature. She was, first, men-
tally weak. Overtaking her
brain by excessive reading and
writing might well unhinge her
mind. This was a pity, but, of
course, she couldn't be blamed
for her inferiority. But there
was a second kind of female
weakness which the early colon-
ial men found positively dis-
concerting. Woman was the
daughter of Eve, and she in-
herited her mother's moral weak-
ness. Worse, like Eve, she had
a seductive power that could
pull men down with her. Al-
though this image of woman as
“the dangerous sex"" was usually
latent, it occasionally sur-
faced as it did in the Salem
witch trials. It was because
of these weaknesses, finally,
that woman was subordinate,
subordinate to her father in
childhood and later to her hus-
band in marriage.

But what did all this intel-
lectualizing actually mean in
the lives of colonial women?

INTO HISTORY

To begin with, the average co-
lonial woman was not well edu-
cated. Most girls who were
educated at all were taught the
rudiments at home or in the sum-
mer sessions of the public
schools if they existed. Even
in Massachusetts, a colony with
a considerable concern for edu-
cation, only 50% of the women
could sign their own names in
the mid 17th century. But how
significant was this depriva-
tion in a society in which edu-
cation was not necessary for
survival and in which most men
were equally deprived? Lack of
educational opportunities did
not mean to the colonial woman
what it would mean to us.

Under English common law in
which woman was declared civil-
ly dead at marriage, woman's
legal status looks oppressive.
However, in America, the harsh-
ness of English law was modi-
fied by Equity law: if a woman
came into a marriage with con-
siderable property of her own

her father would make out a
contract to protect her right
to this property. The law as
practiced protected her rights
in her husband's property. Di-
vorce was permitted when either
party to a marriage could prove
that the other had neglected a
fundamental duty.

The fact that English law
was modified in the American
colonies is significant. Wo-
men were in short supply in
the early period. Companies
who invested in a colony real-
ized how important the pre-
sence of women was to the cre-
ation of a permanent colony
and made efforts to induce wo-
men into coming to the New
World. The London Co. which
underwrote the Virginia colony
advertised for “Agreeable per-
sons, young and incorrupt...
(who would be) sold with their
own consent to settlers as
wives, the price to be the
cost of their own transporta-
tion."" Apparently women
found this offer very attrac-
tive. In 1619 ninety came on
one ship alone. Historians
have speculated that it was in
part this demand for women that
made women's place in colonial
American society much better
than that of their sisters who
remained in the Mother Country.

But even if they had been in
good supply, the work of the
early colonial women, even wo-
men of the wealthier classes,
made them absolutely indispen-
sable. From earliest childhood
when a girl began doing house-
hold and barnyard chores the
female was a useful and pro-
ductive member of her family.
In her early to mid-twenties,
she married and bore on the
average nine to ten children.
Childbearing was hard and the
mother's life expectancy was
7 years less than her husband's.
Two or three of those children
died before they were adults.
Aside from childbearing and
rearing, she was in charge of
the home. It was not the con-
suming home of the 19th century
but the producing home, a small
manufacturing unit which turned
raw materials that the husband
produced—grains, flax, leather,
meat—into usable products.

The woman and her daughter made
all the cloth for the family,
turned the cloth into clothing,
did all the brewing, baking,
and curing of meat. They made
wax and the only form of light-
ing, candles; they made the
family soap out of drippings
and lye, the lye from ashes.
The woman had charge of the fam-
ily garden and of the family
doctoring. It was an extremely
difficult life but through her
work she had the self-respect
and the community respect that

society denied to her 19th cen-
tury sister, the middle class
lady of leisure.

While the majority of women
did essential, respected work
in the home, there was an in-
teresting minority of women who
worked outside the home. ""They
were butchers, silversmiths,
gunsmiths and upholsterers.

They ran mills, tanneries, ship-
yards and every kind of shop,
tavern and boarding house. They
were gatekeepers, jail keepers,
sextons, journalists, printers,
doctoresses, apothecaries, mid-
wives, nurses and teachers.""
This comes as a surprise because
we usually think of women’s work
outside the home and in the pro-
fessions coming in the 19th cen-
tury, after a long and bitter
struggle. Apparently, however,
the prejudice against middle
class women working outside

the home, the horror with

which men heard women's de-
mands to be something more

than just wives and mothers,

was an idea that emerged not
early, but late, with the

growth of wealth and the bour-
geois culture of the late 18th
and 19th centuries.

So we come back to the ori-
ginal question, can we call
these conditions under which
colonial women lived, oppres-
sive to women as women? The
evidence of the oppression of
women per se is far from over-
whelming.

But sometimes we do find a
woman who was dissatisfied with
her position as a woman. I
wonder sometimes how Anne
Hutchinson, an early religious
rebel who ran intellectual cir-
cles around the governor of
Massachusetts Bay colony at her
trial, felt about the charge
that headed the list of com-
plaints against her, that she
had inspired other women to be
""rather...a Husband than a
Wife."" We have no evidence
that Mistress Hutchinson was
anything but a religious rebel
but we have a little in the
case of another Anne. Anne

Bradstreet came to the American
colonies in 1630 as the bride
of an early governor of Massa-
chusetts. She was a poet, one
of the earliest in the English
colonies. Her poems run the
gamut from long philosophical
ones like ""The Flesh and the
Spirit"" to love poems written
to her ""dear and loving hus-
band.""
If ever two were one,
then surely we.
If ever man were loved
by wife, then thee...
But as happy as Anne was with
her marriage, she occasionally
spoke out against a society
that refused to take her intel-
lectual work seriously.
I am obnoxious to
each carping tongue
Who says my hand a
needle better fits,
A poet's pen all scorn
I should thus wrong,
For such despite they cast
on female wit:
If what I do prove well,
it won't advance,
They'll say it's stol'n,
or else it was by chance.
Despite the two Annes how-
ever, I think the evidence suc-
gests that given the frontier
conditions of the early colon-
ies in which life was equally
hard for both men and women,
and where women's work was as
vital and as respected as that
of the ordinary man's, great
debates about the essential e-
quality or inferiority of women
probably seemed to most people,
men and women alike, somewhat
irrelevant. A movement of op-
pressed women awaited a revolu-
tionary ideology of equality
and, at least as important, the
change of status forced on women
by the new industrial society
of the 19th century.

No. There is not as much writ-
ten about early colonial women
as there is about later women,
Elizabeth Dexter's Colonial Wo-
men of Affairs is the only book
about colonial women's work
outside the home. John Demos
has written a very good little
book on the colonial family, The
Little Commonwealth. Root of
Bitterness, a new collection of
documents edited by Nancy Cott,
has a couple of court trans-
criptions, Anne Hutchinson's
and a woman who was accused
of witchcraft. There are bio-
graphies of Anne Hutchinson a-
round including one by a man
who attributed her rebellion to
menopause! Perry Miller's The
American Puritans contains sev-
eral of Anne Bradstreet's poems
and in yellowed notes from col-
lege I have listed a book by
J.H. Ellis, The Work of Anne
Bradstreet, if you really want
to get into it.

A friend who read the column
last time said she was compiling
a women's history bibliography
from the books I mention. She
suggested others do the same.

The Mountain States Women's Abortion Coalition (MSWAC) held a ""Crimes Against Women Tribunal"" on Saturday, November 11, at the CU Denver Center Auditorium. The purpose of the event was to present personal testimony of women who have had difficult experiences regarding abortions, birth control information, rape, welfare and health departments, and all areas of female oppression. Another purpose of the Tribunal was to publicly demonstrate that incidents of women's oppression are not isolated—that many, many women have experiences of this kind.

These are some of the comments made by participants:

""In Utah a person cannot get contraceptive help if she is under 18 without parental consent. I got pregnant when I was 16. My parents are middle-class Catholics and I'd always been taught that abortion was murder. They sent me to a priest for advice. Apparently, when your mother is the president of the Parish's Catholic Women's Club, abortion is OK. He suggested that I get an abortion.""

A psychiatric nurse pointed out that ""repeal of all abortion laws would be great, but then there would be problems with Denver's medical community, which is very conservative and would probably stop doing abortions altogether if there were no laws to protect them.""

The Chairwoman stressed the need to ask for ""more than we hope to get.""

Attorney Sandy Nemser discussed prostitution as a class issue based on the distinction between call girls and whores. Referring to the then upcoming election, Nemser quoted Gloria Steinem: ""If McGovern got pregnant, he'd come to some sort of decision about what to do about it. If Nixon got pregnant, he'd go ahead and get an abortion, deny it, and swear he was a virgin.""

The Chairwoman announced that folksinger Judy Collins had planned to testify at the Tribunal but was unable to attend at the last minute. Collins made the point that she did not want to sing, but just to say how she felt.

Pat Schroeder, at that time campaigning for Congress from the First Congressional District, spoke openly about a woman's right to control her own body. She pointed out that Congress has given priority to heart and cancer research, but that birth control and reproductive research have not been as important to Congress. She then pointed out that only 12 out of 435 members of Congress are women.

A young woman from Fort Worth, Texas, said that she had made the decision not to have children and that as a heterosexual saw her choices as ""(1) Taking a pill a day for thirty years, (2) having a series of abortions, or (3) getting a tubal ligation."" She tried to get a tubal ligation, but ""no doctor in the phone book of Fort Worth would give me one because they didn't think I needed one.""

The Chairwoman introduced a gay woman from Boulder as ""wanting to speak to express solidarity with us and our problems,"" to which the speaker replied, ""Solidarity is not the question, because we're all women."" She went on to discuss the health dangers of contraceptive pills and to offer some suggestions in dealing with rapists.

A female lawyer from Legal Aid remarked, ""What I've learned (in working at Legal Aid) is that women are victims and see themselves as victims, especially poor women.""

An attorney from the National Lawyers' Guild said: ""Abortion really is a class problem because it was never a problem with a rich woman... you could always go to San Juan."" He went on to quote Tolstoy: ""'The rich will do anything for the poor, except get off their backs.' The same goes for men and women.""

One evening in Venice, Cali-
fornia a couple of years ago a
friend and I, in a fit of bour-
geois debauchery, sat drinking
Scotch and water over a hand of
rummy. I was keeping up a pat-
ter of light conversation to
hide the fact that I was losing
the game. The light conversa-
tion being the women's movement.
My friend was basically a cynic
and I was into the revolution:
down with the ruling class (the
rich) and worry about petty de-
tails like the alleged oppres-
sion of women later. Not want-
ing to be accused of turning on
my own people I always gave a
polite interest to the rising
fury of women, but frankly I
felt that it was an unnecessary
factionalization of the radical
movement (whatever that was).
Actually what was happening was
that I was getting my political
analysis from the circle of male
politicos, well-read and arti-
culate, that made up many of my
close friends at that time.

So anyhow, over the Scotch,
Joyce and I sat talking. ""You
know,"" sez I, being just as cute
as hell, “some of my best friends
are men."" We kicked that around
for a while. We came to the con-
clusion that even worse than that
(and, it's true) is that few of
my best friends at that time were
women. I began to consider that
maybe it wasn't some kind of ac-
cident that most of the women I
knew were as boring as hell:
never activating anything on
their own, but existed only in
their relationship to some guy
somewhere, like my boyfriend
this or that. It is pretty hard
to gain valuable companionship
from a person who ain't even
there. Many things, thoughts
that had been laying dormant in
the back of my mind came into
being that evening. Mostly they
concerned my own identity: not
exactly who I was, but definitely
who I was not.

I was in love with James Dean.

Through the course of our con-
versation that night we discov-
ered that we had never seriously
thought of ourselves as women.
Our heroes were male. I was in
love with James Dean—in fact, I
adored James Dean—I idolized
him. That passion, that heaviness
of misunderstood youth,
that sensitivity suppressed and
manifesting in violence. He
seemed so real. In a word, I
wanted to be James Dean. And
it had never occurred to me un-
til this drunken evening that I
could never be him, not even in
a hundred years of affected
heaviness. No, cruel world, I
would have to be James Dean's
woman. I would have to be pa-
tient with that passion. I
would have to be understanding
of his confusion. I would have
to be tolerant of his self-

exploration. Oh shit, a self-
image torn from me. For my
friend and I could suddenly see
that all the admirable traits
that we so loved in our heroes
were reserved for males and for
us was the role of the woman be-
hind the man.

Valour, bravery, adventure,
commitment to an ideal, the hun-
gry intellect, the bursting to
explore the world around us:
in our society these attributes
are neither recognized nor condoned
in women. With the most outrageous
blatancy and with every subtlety
the role of contented mother is
enforced in our psyches. And the
goal of life, the final (ABSOLUTELY
FINAL) glory to our beings is to
be chosen by the best man we can
get (of course, as you grow past
youthful beauty you must lower
your expectations somewhat so as
not to be left unchosen). Our
beings, after we have left our
father’s house, are defined by
the man who has chosen us. And
how proud we can be to be picked
by one of those fine noble men,
the man with a social conscience,
the man with high standing in
the community, the liberal-
minded man who is proud of his
wife, who wants her to put forth
her ideas, in the PTA and in
Democratic Party Women's lunch-
eons. How lucky we can consider
ourselves at being absolved of
the responsibility of having to
define ourselves, of having to
activate our own life—for we
will simply be judged by whom we
have married.

a devastating revelation

Perhaps for some of you read-
ing this it is not much of a
revelation. For my friend and
I it was devastating. Suddenly
there was a limitation put on
us—or rather it was not sudden,
only we had just become aware of
it. We had before obviously al-
lowed ourselves the delusionary
luxury of relegating ourselves
to the special position of excep-
tional women. We considered our-

selves apart and above that de-
plorable mass of women with their
self-imposed dullness and insipid
characters. In our stupid
ignorance, we had assumed that
each individual female was to
blame for her own lack of self-
growth.

For we had not understood the
dynamics of the culturized, in-
stitutionalized, and yet worse,
internalized concept of women in
this society. A role so linear
and confining as motherhood is
expected to fulfill our self-
hood. It is hardly the stuff a
girl child should be expected to
dream on. Unfortunately it is
not only expected to be the
dream stuff of the girl child,
but the reality of the grown
woman. With the highest sophis-
tication of the capitalist econ-
omy women are preyed upon with
this artificial picture of
femaleness. There can be no mis-
taking of the image: ever
searching for ways to be even
more attractive to our mate,
like somehow we owe him that for
his choosing us. Ever search-
ing for new and better ways of
serving our family, unselfishly
devoting the rest of our lives
to their happiness. In a sense,
forgetting your self to serve
other selves. And even more
disheartening is that there was
no alternative to this lifestyle
for a woman, only sad excuses.

dictated roles

The role of mother for each and
every woman has been dictated to
us with the import of religion,
in the sense that to try to es-
cape or alter this fate is the
same as blasphemy to most
people.

We, I, have internalized much
of this propaganda about what a
woman is. I have internalized
it to a point that I very much
need the support and under-
standing of women who are exper-
iencing these same things. Per-
haps now we can begin to explore
who we CAN be. It will be a
long and hard struggle because
we are defying a role which is

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page007.txt,BigMammaRag,,7,"A CONVERSATION WITH DENVER’S

THE FOLLOWING IS A REPORT AND ANALYSIS OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH PAT SCHROEDER, RECENTLY
ELECTED DENVER CONGRESSWOMAN, GRANTED TWO STAFF MEMBERS FROM BIG MAMA RAG, J. BRYSON
AND M. WATERS. 

WE FEEL THAT CRITICIZING THE WOMAN'S IDEAS SERIOUSLY MEANS THAT WE TAKE THAT FOR OURSELVES.

THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT WILL GROW STRONGER ONLY BY CAREFULLY EXAMINING WHAT WE ARE DOING POLITICALLY.

Pat Schroeder's campaign slogan read, ""She wins. We win."" But did we, the women who are her constituents, really win? A recent interview with the Denver Congresswoman-elect raises some interesting questions.

For example, when asked where she stood on women's issues, Ms. Schroeder replied, ""You know, I don't have any problems with that at all. The whole campaign was still run as a humanist campaign. It seems to me that I'm not pushing for men, I'm not pushing for women. I'm not pushing for children. We're pushing for people, and that's what the whole darn thing's about. . . Everybody wants a fair crack at it without looking at whether they're male, female, black, brown, old, young. . .

Furthermore, in responding to a question dealing with what kinds of specific legislation Ms. Schroeder plans to work for while in Congress, she cited at least seven different concerns without so much as mentioning even one issue which deals directly with the problems of women as women in this country today. (Abortion, child care, job discrimination, etc.)

Listed under ""New Directions, '72-'76,"" the Democratic Platform states, ""We are determined to remove barriers that limit citizens because they are black, brown, young, or women; because they never had the chance to gain an education; because there was no possibility of being anything but what they were."" Although Ms. Schroeder's stands are certainly in line with this ideal, that is all it is--an ideal. In other words, it is of primary importance at this particular time in history for minority groups and women to identify themselves as such first. Of course we are all working ultimately for human liberation, but if we spread ourselves as thinly as cheap mayonnaise over too many causes, we may end up with only an ineffectual thin coating of liberality.

When approached on this point--that certain groups (particularly women) must work for their own rights first, Schroeder had this to say, ""Sure it's important for women to seek an identity and I'm not putting that down at all. But I'm also saying that you can't just do that to the exclusion of everything else.""

BMR: ""To be successful in politics, you mean?”

SCHROEDER: ""I don’t even think — that's it. I just don't believe in any one issue. I'm also concerned about peace. If I had to pick one thing, it would probably be peace--defense spending, Armed Forces, environment. . . Those are equally as important. If I stood up and said that I'm primarily concerned about women's rights, I'd be lying. I'm very concerned about women's rights, but no more so than I'm concerned about peace, environment. . .

THIS ANALYSIS IS A CRITICAL ONE. NO ONE SPEAKS FOR US. IDEAS OF ANOTHER WOMAN IS NOT OPPOSED TO SISTERHOOD.

And I just don't believe in getting hung-up on one issue. I find the world is full of one-issue people. They've got tunnel vision.""

This all sounds very convincing, of course. I mean, who would dare say that anything was more important than peace? The fact remains, however, that women have been railroaded by this line of reasoning since the first voices were raised in protest. ""Let's get to the most important things first and then we'll work on your problems,"" say the liberal male politicians and others. That's just another side-stepping tactic to keep us quiet and in ""our places."" Naturally, we are all concerned about peace and the environment as well as many other current issues, but how can we as women always work effectively for those issues when our very effectiveness is already limited by the fact that we are women.

Bella Abzug, the N.Y. Congresswoman is involved with many contemporary problems, but women's issues are usually a priority. Similarly, Ron Dellums, the black Congressman from California is working for a great number of issues but black concerns are of the utmost importance. That kind of identification is not a display of “tunnel vision"" or of “one-issue candidacy."" Ms. Abzug, Mr. Dellums, and others know who they are and just what it is they stand for.

When Pat Schroeder was asked how she came to be identified as a liberal congresswoman, she said, ""Well, I've never really identified myself as anything. I think so often you end up getting into a psychological briar patch. . . And I've tried never to really identify with anything that way."" And responding to a question asking whether she considered herself to be a feminist, Ms. Schroeder replied, ""Oh, I've always identified myself as a woman. Let me back up. To some extent I've never really liked, like the Women's Division of the Bar because I've always figured that men and women practice law the same. It's ridiculous. It should be an integrated bar. Theoretically, we all do the same thing. In law school once, they said, ‘Would you teach a course in women's legal rights?' And I said, ‘Well, no one's teaching one in male's legal rights.' What I think they should do is a bigger picture in, let's say, discrimination. Do the whole thing. . . Don't just do women, don't just do blacks, not just Indians. And I think that's the focus you have to keep on. I've never tried to hide the fact that I'm a woman. I think that any kind of sex discrimination is just awful. I'm not one of those women who say, ‘Gee, I've never found that.' Because I certainly found it everywhere I."
BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page008.txt,BigMammaRag,,8,"went. I fly airplanes. Women

aren't supposed to do that. I went
to Harvard Law School. Women aren't
supposed to do that either. And you
smile and get along and wish you
didn't have to. But you tolerate

it. So I don't say I've never felt
it. I think it's there. But I

still think the whole thing is having
everybody becoming tolerant... of
different living styles, of different
variances in personality. I think
it's a whole thing of human rights.
I'm obviously saying I’m a woman,

but I'm not gonna stand up and say:
""I am for women."" Because you then
immediately become a one-issue can-
didate. Or at least the press will
make you a one-issue candidate.

There is, however, a very great
difference between being identified
as a woman and identifying your-
self with women. The essence of
feminism is not simply that we
“want a fair crack at it."" It is
more a restructuring of the way
people relate to one another as well
as an identification with the his-
tory and culture of women.

Sex discrimination is not ""just
awful."" It is an insidious kind of
animal leash which has choked off the
possibilities of capable women every-
where for thousands of years. Teach-
ing a course in women's legal rights
would not make a woman a female
chauvinist. Pat Schroeder herself
has admitted that ""the power struc-
ture is totally unthreatened by
us"" because ""they know we're out-
siders."" A woman's legal position
before the law is unique—perhaps
more so than any other group's. Re-
cognizing that men have made the
laws and that those laws benefit
them, it is absurd to pretend that
a course in ""male's legal rights""
is necessary to justify the same for
women. That would be like saying
that a course in discrimination
against whites is necessary before
there can be one in discrimination
against blacks!

Years ago individual blacks could
get along in a white world by ""smil-
ing and being tolerant,"" and per-
haps today one woman can get along
in a man's world by the same ques-
tionable methods. There may be per-
sonal success in doing that. Nev-
ertheless, if we as women are to
identify ourselves with all women,
tolerance and subtlety are not al-
ways the answers. (That is not to
say necessarily that yelling and
screaming are either. Obviously
different styles succeed in different
situations.) To answer the question
of discrimination with tolerance,
however, is to be separate and above
other women, who need the voice of
a congresswoman desperately! Pat
Schroeder says that she is ""very
concerned with women's rights, but
no more so than with some other is-
sues."" It seems to us that it is

SOME FURTHER EXCERPTS FROM BIG MAMA

BIG MAMA RAG: IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC
REASON WHY YOU DECIDED TO RUN FOR
CONGRESS?

PAT SCHROEDER: Well, if you're
going to change Congress, you've
got to change the kinds of people
you send there. And I'm very tired
of young men on power trips. I
think we've suffered greatly from
that kind of government.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THE NEW WOMEN
IN CONGRESS ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF
PERSON THAN THESE MEN ON EGO TRIPS?
SCHROEDER: Sure. Yvonne Braith-
waite’s father was a janitor.
Barbara Jordan came out of the South.
We certainly were not a wealthy
family by any means. And yet you
go back and see many of them (con-
gressmen) and they've inherited the
They come from the business
structure or political family. Or
they have certain ties, or they’ve
been ego-maniac types that have been
smooth pretty boys that have been
able to work their way up, and back
scratch a lot. And I really don't
see the women doing that. They've
always announced, ""This is where
I was. This is where I stand. Take
it or leave it.”

BMR: WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION DOES
THAT HAVE WITH THEIR BEING WOMEN? DO YOU THINK IT HAS ANY?
SCHROEDER: I think a lot of it is
they've been shut out anyway, and
they couldn't get in on the back-

threatened by us. (women) They
know we're outsiders.

BMR: DO YOU THINK WOMEN WOULD GO
ON THE SAME TYPES OF TRIPS THAT MEN
HAVE?

SCHROEDER: Oh, sure. Nothing makes
me madder than to encounter a woman
who's made it and says: “I've never
Or:
You know,
She's emulating—

If you're going
to emulate the suppressor, then you
have no right to rise to the top.

BMR: ARE THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT
YOU'VE CONSIDERED MODELS? THAT YOU'VE LOOKED UP TO AND RESPECTED?
SCHROEDER: I think one of the
greatest persons I can think of is
Albert Schweitzer. He could have
stayed in Europe and had a phenomenal
career on the concert circuit...
but instead he opted not to give up
music, because it was his love, but
he opted to be a doctor and help
people in Africa.

BMR: IS THERE A WOMAN WHOM YOU
PARTICULARLY ADMIRE?

SCHROEDER: Umm. I really must
say I admire most of all... the
hoards of women who have gone be-
fore us... really bought the line
about being more responsible, more
reasonable and allow their husband,
you know... Incredible the amount
of sacrifice. Anybody who was
able to buy it, and do it was just
almost beyond my comprehension. It's just give give give give give
and no take, thank you, and there
have been incredible amounts of
women like that.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THAT'S ADMIR-
ABLE OR KIND OF STUPID?

SCHROEDER: Well, we're living in a
different time, you know... I
think women have been the givers of
society and I've always admired the
givers more than the takers. And I
think one of the reasons I admire
Albert Schweitzer so much is that he
didn't have to be a giver, he could
have been a taker—because he was a
man and males were expected to be
the takers... People always say
how neat it was for you to run for
Congress and I keep saying it wasn't
nearly so neat of me as it was of my
husband. He could have absolutely
verboten it. He had the power to
shut it off... There was no ques-
tion. If he had demanded a divorce
immediately, every male in the city
would have understood. He has the
power. I don't. I'm on the out-
side asking for it. It's much
easier for me to ask for it than
it is for him to give it up. He has
the power to say: ""No. I stay in
Denver with my law practice and my
very secure position."" Women have
had to give up for years, and men
haven't, and so I'm always much
more respectful of the one having the
power and giving it up. It's tougher.
He's in the power structure of
Denver. He's giving all that up and
going to Washington where he's total-
ly unknown.

BMR:.. WHY DID HE DO IT?

SCHROEDER: Oh, I don't know. I
just think he's been very sym-
pathetic to the cause all along.
He's been—I shouldn't say radi-
calized—but he's become sensitized
by being in that position. (i.e.,

Dear Mama:

A week or so ago I picked up a copy of your newspaper at the MSWAC Abortion Tribunal. I am very impressed with the paper and with my hardworking sisters in Denver. The article on Sex and The Struggle by Carol was very encouraging to me personally.

Is there a possibility of me receiving copies of your paper on a regular basis? There is no organized Women's group here at U.N.C. and seemingly little interest in starting one so I feel the need for the stimulus your paper gives me.

Please let me know about this as soon as you can,

Love—and that's the truth...
Susan Steedman

Dear People,

It's been emphasized that as women we ought to learn how to really communicate and thus cease viewing each other as threats. However, women are one part of the whole. The truth is, people are not communicating with people.

This capitalistic society possesses a unique way of keeping us humans alienated. It's called ""competition.""

Most women only see other women as competitors because they define themselves in terms of ""beauty"" (society's conception of what beauty is — blond, 36 bust, etc.), wealth and status.

However, men aren't relating for the same basic reasons. And one can't view another as a potential friend if one's worried about whether the poor dude is outdoing you. ""He's fucked more chicks than I, He's sexier. His penis is bigger. He makes 10 grand, I make 8. I've only got a Mustang and he's got a Porsche.""

It's really time to stop evaluating our beings in terms of the outside standards of beauty, wealth and status. When we realize our capacity as humans for such forsaken emotions as compassion, love (not sex) and understanding, we can afford to halt competition.

When this is ended we can realize that our sisters and brothers are not mere obstacles on some road to success who we must beat out or get ahead of. Perhaps then we can see each other as humans with emotional needs and finally reach out and embrace each other instead of crushing one another. Relating to women and men will only come after redefining our goals and worths in terms of humanity.

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page010.txt,BigMammaRag,,10,"SOME THOUGHTS ON WOMEN AND

mental health for over two years
now. Though I have many criti-
cisms of and disagreements with
frequent practices and attitudes
in the field, I will restrict
this discussion to women—and
how their (our) position in this
society is constantly reinforced
by therapists.

I shall cite a few specific
examples of what I am talking
about.

A behavior modification pro-
gram is designed for a female
patient. Among the expected be-
haviors (for which she will earn
such ""privileges"" as eating,
smoking cigarettes, going on an
outing) are hair setting, bed-
making and wearing make-up. Is
hair setting truly an indication
of a well-functioning woman?
Perhaps to these therapists. Or
wearing make-up? I do neither
and haven't for years, and con-
sider myself a well-functioning
woman. And what about making
one's bed? That's another thing
I seldom do, and many of my
friends seldom do. Our defini-
tions of sick and healthy, nor-
mal and abnormal behavior, feel-
ings and needs, must be changed.

Another woman, perhaps be-
tween the ages of 17 and 25, en-
ters a hospital in a ""post-par-
tum psychotic episode"". This is
the label assigned a woman who
becomes depressed immediately
after giving birth. She may
stop eating, stop talking, and
perhaps even reject the child
she has just birthed. Is this
truly sick? Perhaps she is de-
pressed because she suddenly
realized that her schooling will
end, or that her career is over.

Or that she is now, for the next
15 years or so, responsible for
another human being. Responsible
for her/his health, both physical
and mental. Perhaps she recog-
nizes that her life is no longer
her own, that she is expected to
dedicate it to another human
being, and pretty much ignore her
own needs and longings. And
what if she doesn't want to do
this? Then she is made to feel
guilty by those around her. Made
to feel she is inadequate as a
woman, as a human being. Women
are not expected to spend their
lives pursuing their own goals.
They are expected to have as
their primary goal dedication to
another, or two or three (hus-
band, children) human beings. A
woman in post-partum depression
is usually convinced by her ther-
apist, and perhaps her loved
ones (as well as other patients)
that it is ""sick"" of her to have
become depressed. That being a
mother is the ultimate experience
a woman can have. And perhaps so,
for some women. But I suspect
that if more options were truly
open to us, more and more women
would choose not to become
mothers—ever. I suspect that were
the burden of child-rearing shifted,
either severally or collectively,
that the rate of post-partum
psychosis would decrease.

An older woman, perhaps 55,
enters the hospital in deep de-
pression. Her diagnosis is in-
volutional melancholia. Involu-
tional melancholia is described
as being distinguished from psy-
chotic depressive reaction in that
the depression ""is not due to some
life experience"". Perhaps being a
woman and growing old in this
society is not considered enough
of a ""life experience"" to cause
depression. Perhaps having
completed one's positive role in
this society, as sex object and
mother, should not cause a woman
to become depressed. But if a
woman grows up thinking, as most
women in America do, that her
worth, her significance as a
human being, depends on her youth,
beauty and charm (her sexual at-
tractiveness) and her function as
mother, then certainly when she
loses these roles we shouldn't be
surprised that she is depressed.
Nor should we consider her de-
pression a problem. It is a
problem created by the arbitrary
expectations placed on women in
this society—that they devote
their energies to the children
and husband, and that they remain
young. Their depression is valid
and understandable.

And I hope and ache that the
depression changes to anger which
she will direct where it belongs—
not on herself, but on the sys-
tem. And how is such a woman
treated? Few therapists are in
touch with, let alone point out
to such a patient, that it is not
she who is ""sick"", but the soci-
ety. Few therapists recognize
that it is a sick society that
permits people to feel worthless
at age 50, or thinks it healthy
that a human being live her life
vicariously through her husband
and children, or that she be sub-
servient for most of her adult
life. What frequently happens is
that the woman is given electro-
convulsive therapy—shock therapy
to the layperson. Or she is
placed on anti-depressants and
put in a therapy group where she
is counseled that her life is
not over, and it's silly for her
to think it is, or for her to
want to end it.

Would you want to end yours?
Have you known anyone who has or
has wanted to? Were you able to
get in touch with why? I can.
And it makes my blood boil to
know that most women today will
be depressed, either mildly or
severely, and consider it ""their
problem"" and even feel guilty
for needing care and being un-
able to cook and clean for their
husbands because of their depres-
sion. It makes me angry to know
that it will be years before this
changes. Years before male
therapists start to really under-
stand what it is like to be a
woman in this society. Years to be
aware of their own per-

sonal oppression as women, in
all its subtle manifestations—
and years before women patients
stand up and start saying, “
SCREAMING:
NO! I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO
THE MYTH!"
BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page011.txt,BigMammaRag,,11,"Most books written for chil-
dren are insidious perpetuators
of a crippling status quo.
Looking back over our own
childhood favorites, we were
disconcerted to find that we
were exposed to a rather narrow
range of life experiences and
roles in literature. Remember
Nancy (WASP) Drew, whose blond
hair flew in the wind as she
rushed from mystery to mystery
in her brand new sports coupe?
And Peter Pan, surrounded by
sexy little Tinkerbelle and the
capable Wendy, and who never
has to grow up and deal with
growing relationships with real
and mature people?

We want children to have a
broader range of reading avail-
able to them - books that offer
alternative values and models
for new ways of functioning.

We must encourage our children
to develop thoughtful analyses
of the printed word from a
very early age, in order that
they may emerge stronger and
more perceptive from exposure
to the abundance of bad books
designed for them.

CENSORSHIP

Censorship robs a child of
a variety of reading experiences,
both good and bad, and denies
the child a chance to develop
his/her discriminatory powers.
However, unless he/she is exposed
to alternatives to prevailing
limits of sex-class-race-age
stereotyping, it will be hard
for any child to see a way out
of the confinement of life
situations presented in tradi-
tional childhood reading
material.

CRITERIA

We set out to explore the
available market in children's
literature. Very few books,
we found, could satisfy our
criteria - that they be non-sex-
ist, non-racist, and non-condes-
cending to young readers - in
other words, that they be
non-chauvinistic in every sense.
Even fewer were interesting,
well-written, or reasonably
priced.

LITTLE MISS MUFFET FIGHTS BACK

The trend in books for little
children is to present very
beautiful, adult-aimed illustra-
tions, accompanied by inane text,
or sugar-coated, but hardly
disguised didacticism. Grownups
are always right in the end;
(white, men) doctors and (white,
motherly) teachers and nurses
and (strong, white, manly)
policemen are not to be disputed.
They will unfailingly lead a
child from pain and error into
the right.

We read a large portion of
the books suggested in a list
called “Little Miss Muffet
Fights Back,"" printed by Femi-
nists on Children's Media.

These books are principally for
older boys and girls. Most of
them feature girls in major roles;
however, they are limited to

anti-Communism,
youthful adventures;

the world to seek adventure,
gets to keep his pet rabbit for
him, or take care of his dog.

It is made clear that true love

stereotypical behavior and the
stories are thoroughly laced with
ladylike demeanor;
silent male

in the end,
the girls turn for help and
approval. The typical heroine
is either a fairy princess or
the cook-and-mother-figure in
and the
""different"" girl, who has no
interest in boys, but wants to

pursue her own interests or
develop her own skills eventually
finds real happiness in the
form of a boyfriend. As
consolation for having to stay

home when her boyfriend goes
to sea, or for having to mind

the hearth while he goes out into
she

's the only happiness for a girl,

that happiness is the only goal

in life, and that this love-
leading-to-happiness consists

of women's silent sacrifice.

FOR LITTLE BOYS

The role models presented
to little boys, although
generally allowing for greater
assertiveness and self-expression
are also limiting, in that they
communicate repeatedly the
importance of competition,
strength, daring, and masterful-
ness, and deny the importance
of softness, sharing, feeling
and reciprocal relationships
with strong, daring, and master-
ful little girls.

We did find several excel-
lent bibliographies of Feminist
literature, which contain
suggestions also for children's
reading. The Feminist Press
at State University of New York,
College at Old Westbury, Box
334, Old Westbury, New York 11568,
lists many sources; KNOW Press,
P.O. Box 86031, Pittsburgh, PA,
15221, publishes a very
comprehensive bibliography of
Women's Literature; the Denver
Public Library, while limited
in Feminist Children's Literature,
has several useful pamphlets in
its ""Heritage"" series.

From our own explorations
we offer the following (by no
means complete) list of books
we liked, remembering that the
influence of children's books
lies less in the ideology

presented, but finally in the

ability of a child to analyze
what he/she reads, to consider
the printed word from the
perspective of a person who
knows him/herself as a whole
and valuable individual whose
ideas and feelings are valid
and important. We list the
following books as an alterna-
tive presentation to the tradi-
tional portrayal of chauvinism
in our culture's sex roles,
race roles, age roles, and to
economic exploitation
in the name of and over the
bodies and psyches of persons
coerced into those roles.

Both the RIP Bookstore,
at 737 E. 17th Avenue, and
the Woman's Voice Bookstore,
673 South Pearl, are attempting
to stock the above books on
their shelves. The books
should be available soon.

In future issues of Big
Mama Rag, we plan to review
children's books regularly,
and we welcome suggestions and
additions to our list.

After a year of consciousness-raising and unfocused political actions, our group decided to direct its energies towards the Women's Health Movement, which we feel has real revolutionary implications for the whole Feminist Movement. Women have lost the power we once had over our own bodies and been forced into dependency on a male-controlled medical profession motivated by profit. There was a time when women were responsible for the health care of their own families and households and midwives responsible for all gynecological and obstetrical care. Reclaiming control of our bodies from the medical industry, Madison Avenue, and big business is a basic step in gaining control of our lives.

Three women in our group traveled to Los Angeles and San Francisco about the same time and gleaned some information from the women's centers about what was happening in women's health. One of these women went back to L.A. and attended a self-health course which met weekly. She learned the simple procedures; she brought back the experience, some literature, and a dozen speculums; and Colorado Springs had its first self-health session that week. We found that our fears and self-consciousness vanished almost at once with the excitement that came with the first real knowledge about our bodies.

We realized why physicians have been reluctant to share their information ($$$) and, more important, we realized we were making a reality out of the slogan ""Control of our own bodies.""

We have found that what works most effectively for us is to have three sessions with each small group of women (about 6-8 has been maximum). Our first session always begins with a ""rap time"" when many fears, misconceptions, resentments, and experiences about things like sex, reproduction, and physiology are shared. We find in sharing our experiences that each woman has at some point in her life been mistreated by physicians, and for many it has been a general rule.

One woman we know, having suffered severe cramps for several months, went to her doctor to have her Dalkon shield (IUD) removed. She learned that the device had slipped and that her cervix had dilated. She had been having labor pains for months! (She was led to believe that discomfort was normal in using an IUD.) The irony is that because she knew the cervix would have to be dilated for removal of the device, and because she wanted a non-messy, constant means of birth control besides the pill, she had it removed only as a last resort. Had she been participating in self-health and examining herself on a regular basis, she would have known there was a real problem and would have gone much sooner for help.

Each woman at the first session purchases a packet made up of good factual literature, her own speculum, and the other necessary supplies for self-examination. There are always at least two women present who have been through the recommended three sessions and feel confident about the procedures. These two women demonstrate to the group how to use the speculum and how to give bi-manual (two hands) pelvic examinations and then invite each woman to participate. If for any reason a woman prefers not to take part, of course she needn't do so. So far every woman has been eager for her turn. Seeing your cervix for the first time is a mind-blow! The mystery is gone, and you gain a new liking for your own body.

In the second session most of our anxiety and self-consciousness is gone. We are able to notice more in our examinations (what is a ""tipped uterus""? what are the differences in the cervix of a woman who has had children and one who has not? what are the normal changes in color, shape, and size of the cervix?) Rap-time might be discussing the written material distributed the previous week, or any other subject of interest; we have much to learn from each other.

Either the second or third session is a good time to learn breast self-examination, using the step-by-step procedures explained in a handout sheet.

By the third session, women are usually turned on to the political implications of self-health and to the fact that getting to know ourselves may save our lives. We've been killing ourselves with panic abortion methods, going without PAP smears, etc. We hope that women will continue examining themselves on a regular basis from now on. And now many of these women are ready to start new groups, which is how the movement spreads.

The week of October 11-14th a National Self-Health Conference was held in Iowa City in which women from all over the U.S. and even Canada got together to share their questions and knowledge about women's health. We have divided into geographic regions in order to spread self-health to all our sisters in the quickest and most effective way. Women of our region were present from Colorado Springs, Nebraska, and Utah, and we plan to reach out to other states in the coming months.

Women from Self-Health Clinic I in California (the Feminist Women's Health Center in L.A.) were the originators of the national conference and gave us ideas from their own experience over the past two years. We learned skills, saw films, attended workshops, and generally got turned on to the potential of the women's health movement.

We in Colorado Springs are hoping soon to start work in abortion counseling and referral, wider self-health reach-out (to non-feminist women's groups, for example), patient advocacy (i.e. going along with sisters to doctors, hospitals, etc., demanding information, observation, and high standards), and eventually even opening a women's clinic. We have, in effect, become a women's health collective.

Although we have found one supportive doctor, most physicians are threatened by this movement, and we see several reasons for it. First, of course, they are afraid we'll stop coming to them entirely and they'll no longer get our money. For the most part this isn't true, since one of the main results of self-health is that we get women who show some signs of abnormality to go to a doctor sooner than they might usually go, but equipped with more useful information than they might normally have. A woman in a recent self-health class (her first session) had what the more experienced women immediately felt to be an inflammation of the cervix (bright red instead of pink). She was being treated for a bladder infection by a doctor, but had not been examined internally. (Her medication was not reducing pain, incidentally). So with a sister for support, she went to her doctor again the following..."

ing day and told him about her  
self-examination,  
that what she had seen was a  
possible irritation of the cer-  
vix. He was freaked, but pro-  
ceeded to examine her and he  
was surprised (we weren't) to  
find that she did have “cervi-  
citis"" (any irritation of the  
cervix). This would have a  
large effect on the bladder in-  
fection or could be a sign of  
some more serious infection  
“such as gonorrhea. So although  
we cannot diagnose or prescribe,  
we teach each other awareness.  
There is a second reason we  
believe doctors are threatened.  
They need to maintain the eli-  
tist barrier between patient and  
physician and uphold their mys-  
tic powers. It is essential for  
them to hoard and guard their  
knowledge and to keep us ignor-  
ant. We've been told so many  
times ""it won't hurt"", ""you  
can't really feel that way"",  
""it's not serious"", etc. that we  
begin to doubt ourselves rather  
than the doctor. They see us  
gaining power over our lives;

This kind of paranoia clear-  
ly shows in the recent bust at

When we begin questioning

us with force (i.e. arrest)

On January 22 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that in the first three months of pregnancy the decision of whether to have an abortion is between a woman and her doctor; in the next six months, the state may regulate the abortion procedure in ways that reasonably relate to maternal health. Only in the last 10 weeks may a state ban abortions except where they are necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.

The decision firmly recognizes a woman's right to control her own body as a part of her fundamental right to privacy, and was seen as a victory for the women's movement.

Not until March 5, however, did the Colorado Supreme Court, basing its ruling on the January decision, strike down the state abortion law's restrictions as unconstitutional. The Colorado law, which previously had been considered ""liberal,"" contained certain ""requirements"" which the U.S. Supreme Court specifically stated were unconstitutional, namely, 1) that there be a residency requirement; 2) that abortions be performed in hospitals accredited by a private agency; 3) that applicants be screened by a hospital committee; or 4) that independent doctors certify the potential dangers of a pregnancy to a woman's physical or mental health.

In addition, the Colorado decision guaranteed the civil rights of those hospital employees who refuse to participate in abortion procedures by stating that such refusal may not be a basis for any disciplinary action against that employee. The decision also stated that any hospital can refuse to admit a patient for an abortion.

Denver citizens demonstrate at a recent abortion rally.

According to members of the Mountain States Women's Abortion Coalition (MSWAC), which has been investigating the implementation of the new rulings in local hospitals, most hospitals are changing or have changed their procedures to comply with the ruling. Some of those hospitals providing abortions without restriction during the first trimester are General Rose, Beth Israel, Denver General, and Colorado General.

On March 12 the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling on the Illinois abortion law, and declaring it unconstitutional, concurrently issued an order that all state governments must comply with the original January decision and will no longer be allowed to procrastinate in creating new laws.

""One thing I'm worried about,"" said Nancy Stern, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, commenting on the January 22 decision, ""is that women will now say, ‘OK, it's all over. Now I can get an abortion if I want one and that's that.' But there's a real possibility that a state pressured by anti-abortion forces will pass abortion laws, under the guise of protecting a woman's health, which will actually succeed in restricting her right to an abortion.""

BMIR Editorial

by Bourge Miller

“While the January 22 Supreme Court decision concerning abortion brought welcome and hard-fought-for relief to millions of Americans, concerned women must face the reality that the decision is not at all the total victory sought in the fight to control our own reproductive lives. Rather, it is only the first step, although a very meaningful one, in that direction. The ruling has removed many barriers, but has left or erected others.

Some painful issues still pending and some points to be vitally aware of are these:

1) The ruling places no restrictions on abortion during the first trimester, except the requirement that it be performed by a licensed physician. However, beginning with the second trimester, states are still free to regulate abortion procedures ""in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health."" Legislative action in this area must be carefully monitored to ensure continued protection of our rights.

2) The Supreme Court ruling makes no reference to the age at which a woman may obtain an abortion. Legislation will most certainly take place in this area. Must our younger sisters still face the red tape of parental or spousal consent? Do these women not also have the right to privacy as guaranteed by the Constitution?

3) Although the high court has just recently issued an additional order directing states to bring themselves into full compliance with the new ruling, it is clear that some state legislatures, state attorneys general, hospitals, etc. will most certainly attempt to impede the implementation of the decision. Those in the abortion rights movement must continue to press for speedy implementation of the ruling until all have complied.

4) ""Right-to-Life"" forces have responded to the ruling with moralistic indignation and irrelevant appeals to emotionalism that do not deal with the constitutional issues at hand. They have also introduced two bills into Congress (See page 8 - this issue).

5) It is extremely important to note that the ruling leaves open a possibility of the passage of total repeal legislation either on the state or federal level. The abortion rights movement should press for the passage of the Abortion Rights Act of 1973 which would take the question of abortion out of the state criminal codes altogether.

With the above highlights of still existing problems in mind, it should be clear that the battle women have been fighting to gain full control of their own reproductive lives is far from over. Much still needs to be done to protect and ensure these rights for all women. The abortion movement is and will continue to be challenged on all fronts and at all levels. That challenge must be met with even greater efforts and determination than before.

Bourge Miller has been involved in the abortion movement for a year and a half. She was at one time active with MSWAC, and is vitally concerned with women's right to control their own bodies."

P.2. Since we last came to you, we
on the staff of BMR have under-
gone several changes. Some of
our members have gone, and new
women have joined us. The major-
ity of us were undergoing some
sort of personal upheaval or
other, and for a while the paper
seemed to have a low priority
for most of us. Couple that
with the organizational problems
of any new project-oriented
group, and you have it we were
getting bogged down.

We seemed to rally, however,
around the issue of our group
process. This carries a lot of
significance for us, because we
are determined to carry sister-
hood into the interactions of
our work group. The usual hier-
archy we confront in our jobs
and society as a whole disgusts
us — no person's potential is
highly utilized when orders are
handed down from the top. We
each see a lot of ourselves in
the paper, so there is an abun-
dance of creativity to tap. We
have struggled to find ways to
bring out each woman's unique
contribution.

The first major structural
decision we made was to split in-
to task groups: Ads & Distribu-
tion, Journalism, Photos & Graph-
ics, Layout and Communications.
In these smaller groups, we have
started seeking procedures which

will facilitate our interaction.
Some methods we have adopted
are choosing a woman by lot at
the beginning of one meeting to
chair the next so that she can
prepare an agenda and assure
continuity and follow-through of
our efforts, and choosing a
Process Observer, also by lot at
the beginning of each meeting,
to facilitate our evaluation of
our interaction. Interwoven
into these efforts is our own
commitment to each other, to
hear and to speak and to respond
to one another's feelings.

At present, it would be safe
to say that none of us is totally
satisfied with BIG MAMA RAG. We
continue to be excited about the
possibilities for Denver's first
women's journal, however, and we
have batted around numerous pro-
posals for upgrading BMR.

We are investigating means of
improving our appearance so that
we will have a more appealing for-
mat. We want to go to smaller
print throughout so that we can
widen the scope of our information
and carry more news — national,
local, international — and more
investigative journalism. This
would involve expanding our
journalism group, specifically
with part-time experienced women
writers, and would also include
publishing more often.

We have expanded sufficiently
to require office space and the
supplies that go with it, but to
date we do not have the money to
obtain such a luxury. This is
another area we are investigating.

We have discussed many times
the question of who we want BMR
to reach. Although we intended
the paper as a forum for any
woman to speak, we must concede
that through our choice of arti-
cles, we make the paper more than
a forum. We know that a woman
who has decided conclusively

where we’re at

against the liberation movement
will never open BMR, and we are

not missionaries trying to

change her.

But we do want to speak to
women who are beginning to feel
anger about the roles assigned
to them, to women who are be-
ginning to reach out for a new
grasp on themselves and for a
new communication with other
women. There are a lot of these
women whom BIG MAMA is not
reaching, and we are open for
suggestions as to solving this
dilemma. One thing that would
help is to know who we are
reaching, so please let us know
who you are.

About the only editorial
policy we have begun using so
far is that, while constructive
criticism of one another and
the women's movement is welcome,
anything that is downright des-
tructive or damaging to sister-
hood will not be printed. Fur-
ther, we are trying to come up
with some guidelines to use to
upgrade the quality of our
writing in general.

We are a strong group of
women, and we have begun an ex-
citing project, a chance to ex-
press ourselves and provide
Denver women with an invaluable
communications network. But we
have limited time and limited
resources (all of us work full-
or part-time at other jobs to
support ourselves and families).

We want to hear from you, and
we feel an absence of response.
We want your suggestions and
reactions on format, content,
style, whatever — and to a
large degree, the evolving
quality of BIG MAMA RAG depends
on it.

counseling center located at
the corner of 18th and Clarkson,
has been in operation for two
and one-half years. A staff
of two women and two men is
available from 9-9 Monday
through Friday.

Four of our services may
be of special interest to
women. First, among our job
listings are some openings
especially created for women.
If you have a skill and are
seeking employment call us at
892-1812. Second, we know of a
number of excellent feminist
counselors, some of whom will
take referrals from us on a
sliding-scale basis. Third,
we specialize in child
advocacy. This involves
working with juvenile offenders
and assisting them with legal
hassles and group home place-
ments. Lastly, problem
pregnancy counseling which
consists first, of helping
women decide among the available
options. If she chooses to have
a therapeutic abortion, we
refer her to trusted physicians
either in Denver or out-of-state.
One of our female staff
members accompanies her to a
Denver hospital if she has no
one else to be with. We have
never been unable to arrange
a legal abortion for a woman
with financial problems."

2seaged cry

In the summer of 1970, Ana Lou Coelho and her four

children left Oakland, California, to go camping on the
Yuba River outside of Grass Valley in Nevada County,

California.

“It was beautiful and we all loved being on the earth
again,” Ana said. “I asked the children if they'd like to
stay — and they said yes, so after spending most of the
summer there, we moved up permanently in Septem-
ber, 1970. I had wanted to get out of Oakland, and get
the children out of the city — so it seemed like a very
good thing. We were all really happy up there. . .”

One year later — on September 25, 1971, life changed
drastically for Ana and her children — Linda, 11; Sheri,
10; Rhonda, 14; and Ronnie, 7. On that day, Ana was
charged with second degree murder and held without
bail in Nevada County Jail. Her children were sent to
stay with their grandmother. She was charged with
killing a man she didn't know in a barroom brawl. The
man was stabbed to death. Ana had been wearing a
hunting knife in the bar the night of his death.

An all-white Nevada County jury found Ana guilty on
December 10, 1971. Ana has three Apache grand-
parents, and one Chicano grandparent.

We met in mid-February, 1972, 25 days after she had
been sentenced to life and transferred to the California
State Institution for Women at Frontera. She was CIW
number 8811.

Ana, five feet tall, her shiny black hair tied in braids on
each side of her small olive face, looked about 17 years
old instead of 32. She wore a prison uniform covered
by a beige prison jacket about three times too big for
her. Her room, small and bare except for bed, toilet,
sink and desk, was decorated with pictures of her chil-
dren. It was obvious that they were as much the focus
of her life in that small barren room as they had been in
their home on the Yuba River.

“I've never been in jail before and to be plunked down
in prison is so heavy,” she said, her hands shaking as she
fixed coffee for both of us in a small automatic pot.
“At times I get so close to losing my mind; I think I just
can’t take it. I’m here for a crime I didn’t commit. I
guess if I wasn’t innocent it wouldn't be so hard, but I
just can’t accept that I'm really here for something I
didn’t do. All during the trial I was optimistic because
I didn’t see how they could find me guilty of something
I didn’t do. Plus... the D.A. had about 30 witnesses
and they told 30 different stories.

“The only thing they all agree to was that I had a knife

I admitted having. I had my hunting knife strapped on
my side, and somebody took it away from me when a
big fight broke out. It turned into a brawl — like a
free-for-all with 15 or 20 people involved. At this point
I was shoved back up against the jukebox. It was like a
football huddle only everyone was swinging, including
myself. It was during this time the man was stabbed. I
had never even seen him until the pictures of him were
shown at the trial. I didn’t even know anyone had been
stabbed until I heard someone yell, ‘Someone’s been
stabbed.’ The crowd had already dispersed, and we
were standing outside when the police came. I was
standing with this friend and someone told the police
officer, ‘Arrest them two because someone’s been
stabbed and either one of them did it.’ The officer told
me to get in the car, which I did.”

Ana said she was wearing the knife because she was
planning to join her children and another family on a
camping trip when she left the bar.

“I always wore Levis, tee-shirt, and a hunting knife on
these camping trips,” she said. “The knife I used pri-
marily in the preparation of meals, making sandwiches,
cutting watermelon or cantaloupe — just general camping
uses. I used it to help skin a rattlesnake once, but I had
a hard time as the knife wasn’t very sharp.”

During the trial, one pathologist testified that it would
take an incredible amount of strength to inflict the
wound — because it penetrated every muscle and tough
tendon and clipped the man’s backbone. He was
slashed from his chest to his waist. Ana, whose first
arrest came with the death, weighs less than 100
pounds. Testimony was contradictory — and even
Ana’s lawyer, David Kogus of San Francisco, couldn't
believe that the jury found her guilty with such scant
evidence.

Although Ana maintained hope for her freedom to the
very end, she knew the odds were against her, just be-
cause of her ethnic background and the attitudes to-
wards her which came out on the front pages of the
local paper and in the courtroom.

“The witnesses were so hostile. And the jury seemed
disinterested. One lady knitted through the whole trial
and another one addressed Christmas cards. I guess
they were hostile, too. I wasn’t an active member of
the community. We lived three or four blocks out of
town. We had made friends with a family with seven
children and apparently the community didn’t like them
so, they were hostile to me because of our association
with them. I didn’t know how unpopular they were
until the trial. It was also against me that I’d been
divorced six years and I was on AFDC (welfare). All
kinds of negative points. Witnesses said they heard me
arguing and saying things in Mexican or Spanish, but I
can't neither speak Mexican nor Spanish, so whatever I
said was in English! It didn't matter to them that I
had been past president of the PTA in Alameda, or

active with the drug abuse council and the Alameda
City Council. None of these things were brought up in
the trial. They said I was on welfare, but they didn’t
say that I had been working with the social worker and
he was putting me on job training. I wanted clerical or
secretarial work, although I'd like to teach roller-ska-
ting. (Ana took third place in the National Roller
Skating Meet in 1956 in Richmond, Virginia, represent-
ing the Bay Area and California.)

“The jury was unbelievable,” her attorney said.

“They were so hostile to her; it was apparent from the
first. Ana was disliked in the area because she was close
to people in a motorcycle gang who had moved to Grass
Valley and terrorized the people. It's a conservative,
white, older community of people who had moved out
to Grass Valley to escape the cities themselves. I was
used to San Francisco juries, and I didn’t anticipate or
see what a small-time jury would be like. Ana had asked
me to get a change of venue and she was right, I should
have listened to her. I’ve been living with this case now
and it’s really rough. Ana has beautiful children, and
comes from a fine family. I feel so strongly about it I
don’t think I'd go back to Nevada County for another
trial.

Dear Mom,

I hope you can get here for

you in peace

Ronnie,

“There were allegedly two eyewitnesses, but they didn’t
seem like much to me. And I don’t think they’re worth
much ...so I would expect that eventually we'll get her
out on appeal. I’m confident we'll get her a new trial.
I just don’t know whether they’ll cut her loose or not. I
don’t know... I can only hope.

“I went to New York to talk to the guy who really did
it. But he’s too scared — he’s on parole — and not will-
ing to confess to anything, let alone open his mouth... 
so that’s not much help.”

“When I first got here,” Ana said, “I didn’t know any-
thing. Like the first day I went back to my room and it
was locked — I went up to the control desk and asked

if I could have a key to my door. She just looked at me
and said, ‘No, we don’t give keys.’ I said, ‘Well, how do
I get in?’ ‘Just tell us and we'll pop your door,’ the
officer said. I was so scared and ignorant of what I
could and couldn't do, I just stayed in my room that
first week and went so close to going out of my mind —
I was dangerously close to it. I knew I couldn’t stay.
But then I found out we could go out in the yard — plus
I found a copy of the rules and read them and knew
more what was going on.

“It's so hard to write to my kids — there’s nothing to
write but bad things. All I can tell them is someday
justice will be done. Ronnie said, ‘Those people must
be mean to keep you there,’ and I just told him, ‘They
can’t help it — they’re doing what the court ordered
them to do. It’s hard for them to understand — I'm
innocent, yet I’m being punished for it. It's hard for
me to understand too — and I guess I never will accept
it. God knows I am innocent — and if I can just main-
tain my sanity, someday justice will be done. It has to
be. I can’t stand not being with my children.”

My name is Ana Lou Coelho #8811, my
story appeared in your April 1972, Volume II,
Number 8 edition of Off Our Backs.

On the 25th of this month it will be one
year that I have been unjustly incarcerated
for a crime which I DID NOT COMMIT!

I did not receive a fair trial and it
took the jury less than 15 minutes to reach a
guilty verdict. The charge is 2nd degree mur-
der. My conscience is clear and in my heart
I know that I am not guilty of this crime, but
that is of little help as long as I am being
held prisoner of the State of California. My
appeal was heard on August 15th in Sacramento,
California.

What I need is financial help, from any-
one who is willing to contribute. I need
enough money to cover an Appeal Bond, so that
I can be cut loose. The Cut Ana Loose Fund
(C.A.L.F.) has been set up by my mom, but so
far it hasn't been too successful, therefore
I am asking anyone and everyone who is able
and who cares to please donate whatever you
can to the fund. Donations may be sent dir-
ectly to my mom: Rose Spanyard, 1557 79th
Ave. Oakland, California, 94621.

I'm sure that there are other counties,
like Nevada County, in which there is no
justice and its theme song should be “I've
Been Working on the Railroad.” These coun-
ties should be exposed for what they are doing
to innocent people. Everyone, including the
jury, judge, D.A., police and Public Defender
are either related or know each
other very well. And it doesn't matter whether
you are guilty or not, if they want to prose-
cute you they will do it and especially if you
are unliked and not white and an outsider.

For these three reasons and only for these
three reasons, I am a prisoner of the State
in the only Women's Prison in California.

I am asking for your help and anything
you can do will be deeply appreciated by me
and my family.

Thank You Sincerely,

Ana Coelho #8811

advice and offered to help. You are really
beautiful people.

hook review  

Carolyn Agosta ff  

DIALECTIC OF SEX, by  
Shulamith Firestone  

Shulamith Firestone was born  
in Ottawa, Canada. She atten-  
ded several universities in  
the U.S. and earned a Bachelor  
of Fine Arts in Painting.  

She is presently editor of  
""Notes,"" a journal of radical  
feminism.  

In Dialectic of Sex, Ms.  
Firestone presents a clear  
idea of the women's movement.  
She replaces the myths and  
fears surrounding feminism with  
reasoning and understanding.  
She brings an awareness of the  
way in which each of us is  
being destroyed by our society.  
Further, she explains how  
women and men can only  
develop half of themselves at  
the expense of the other half.  
The myth has always been that  
the two sexes complement each  
other's abilities and personal-  
ity. But women and men are  
whole complete beings within  
themselves. So what part of  
our roles is a result of  
socializing and what part is  
biological? Or is any of it  
biological? Or is all of it  
socializing?  

The love-myth is destroyed  
in Ms. Firestone's explanation  
of the selfishness involved in  
a relationship...possessiveness,  
envy, jealousy, the obvious  
importance of physical beauty  
(make-up, clothes, hair.) The  
games we play; she bolstering  
his ego, he ""protecting"" and  
""defending"" her, way up there  
on her pedestal; she being  
""delicate"" and ""feminine;"" he  
being “strong"" and a ""real  
man.""  

In relating feminism and  
Freud, Ms. Firestone points  
out Freud's greatest  
failing, that of questioning  
the individual, rather than  
society as a whole as the cause  
for so-called ""maladjustment.""  
‘Feminism and Freudianism  
arose at about the same period  
of time; but Freud was  
accepted as the ""lesser of two  
evils,"" even though his  
theory is full of contradic-  
tions.  

Shulamith Firestone  
discusses and breaks down the  
entire theory of the family  
structure: father as bread-  
winner, mother as nursemaid  
and somewhat dependent upon  
the father, and ""children,""  
hopelessly dependent upon  
mother and father.  

This book is recommended to  
anyone feeling and seeing the  
Oppression of our society,  
whether woman, man, black,  
red, yellow, white.  

Next hearing date in ESTHER GOOD-  
YEAR vs. GATES RUBBER is March 28 at  
8:30 a.m. in Judge Finesilver's  

court on 2nd floor of courthouse at  
19th and Stout. Supportive women  
please attend.  

(CPS) At the end of 1972, suppor-  
ters of the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA) felt certain of imminent vic-  
tory. Now, three months later,  
massive anti-Equal Rights Amendment  
forces (Stop the ERA) have organized  
in an effort which puts easy and  
immediate ratification of the 26th  
Amendment in serious doubt.  

Early last year, Congress passed  
the Equal Rights Amendment, which  
would outlaw all forms of sex dis-  
crimination that are based on law  
or governmental action. It is nec-  
essary for 38 state legislatures to  
ratify the amendment. To date, 28  
states have ratified the ERA, 11  
have defeated it, leaving 11 states  
undecided. Ten of those 11 states  
must ratify the ERA for it to pass  
this year.  

Opponents of the Equal Rights  
Amendment make two main objections  
to its ratification. They claim  
that passage of the ERA would make  
women eligible for the draft, and  
that it would release men from their  
obligations to support a family.  

Jacqueline G. Gutwillig, chair-  
woman of the Citizen's Advisory  
Council on the Status of Women,  
labelled opponents' arguments irrele-  
vant. She commented that if a  
draft is reactivated, ""It would  
only be in a serious national emer-  
gency that would undoubtedly expose  
women to dangers as great as combat--  
and most women would want to defend  
their country in such circumstances.""  

As for the opponents' second ar-  
gument, releasing men from financial  
responsibility of their family,  
Gutwillig explained that a court  
never intervenes in a stable family  
situation. Therefore, families  
would continue to make individual  
and personal decisions affecting the  
their lives. In cases of separation  
or divorce, according to Gutwillig,  
the court would take into considera-  
tion the economic situations of both  
husband and wife before granting any  
financial settlements.  

As organized opposition grows  
stronger, supporters of the ERA ner-  
vously turn to a grassroots cam-  
paign in the remaining states in  
order to ensure a ratification, al-  
though undoubtedly a very narrow  
one, of the amendment which will fi-  

nally give women equal rights under  
law.  

Women in Colorado, which has al-  
ready ratified the ERA, who are in-  
terested in supporting its ratifica-  
tion in other states should send do-  
nations to: NOW Emergency Fund,

Colorado Cases  

JANET BONNEMA vs.  
STATE HIGHWAY DEPT.  

Charge: A job appointment  
was revoked when sex of appli-  
cant was learned, even though  
she was the most qualified appli-  
cant. State Court settlement  
reinstated her at job at  
Straight Creek Tunnel with back  
pay. Federal Court settlement  
awarded her attorney fees,  
$6750 cash settlement, and per-  
mission to do job-related  
duties formerly denied because  
of sex. Sandra Rothenberg was  
attorney for this case, consi-  
dered a landmark in the U.S.  
for breaking down ancient pre-  
judice against women in mines  
or tunnels.  

MARIANNE TAYLOR vs.  
MOUNTAIN ELECTRIC COMPANY  

Charge: Discharge and re-  
placement by a man, even though  
work was satisfactory. Ms.  
Taylor lost case, largely be-  
cause it was a fairly old case  
and witnesses were difficult to  
produce.  

PATTY HODGINS vs.  
BOULDER DAILY CAMERA  

Charges: Job discrimination  
on basis of sex, particularly  
in work assignment. Hearing  
Examiner did find that the  
Camera had committed sex dis-  
crimination, but not against  
Ms. Hodgins.  

MAUREEN TESLER vs.  
COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 12  

Charges: Discharge due to  
pregnancy, and discrimination  
based on religious creed.  
Hearing Examiner found in her  
favor. Commissioners haven't  
rendered a decision.  

JUNE FIELD vs.  
MONTROSE SCHOOL BOARD  

Charges: Employment as busi-  
ness teacher denied because her  
husband was already employed by  
the district and because dis-  

trict wanted business teacher to  
be part-time coach. Case in  

progress.  

VALERY McALLISTER vs.  
DEPT. OF JUVENILE PAROLE  

Charge: Discharge on basis  
of sex. Discrimination in job  
assignment on basis of sex.  
State District Court found in  
her favor, but Parole has  
attempted to reverse decision.

It's not nice to fool Mother Nature!  
(Chiffon Margarine ad)  
STATES  

I've always thought that the appear-  
ances of W.I.T.C.H. (Women's Inter-  
national Terrorist Conspiracy From  
Hell) was one of the cleverer early  
WLM yippie tactics. And since like  
many of my sisters I'm curious about  
witches, I decided to do a little  
research on the history of women  
and witchcraft for this month's issue  
of Big Mama Rag. One place to start  
such a search is with the late medie-  
val witch craze.  

The European witch craze was start-  
ling in its dimensions. Starting in  
Germany, Italy and other countries  
in the 14th century, it spread to  
France and England in the 16th cen-  
tury. Thousands upon thousands of  
people were killed—usually burned at  
the stake. One writer estimated that  
in certain German cities, there were  
an average of six hundred ""witches""  
put to death a year. ""Nine hundred  
witches were destroyed in a single  
year in the Wertzberg area, and a  
thousand in and around Como. At  
Toulouse four hundred were put to  
death in a day. In the Bishopric  

of Trier, in 1585, two villages  
were left with only one female in-  
habitant each."" And this mass  
hysteria was no delusion of the un-  
educated poor. Belief in witches  
was nearly universal, even among  

the emerging scientific community.  
Most important, it had the active  
support of the all-powerful Church,  

“Christianity or dreams”  

If it is true as some have suggested,  
that witchcraft represented surfac-  
ing of an older pre-Christian cult in  
which women played a major role, you  
would expect the Church to feel very  
threatened by it. Oddly enough the  
Church had through most of its his-  
tory officially considered the tra-  
ditional powers of witches—casting  

spells, turning themselves into ani-  
mals and so on—as the products of  
insanity or dreams. What changed  
the Church's mind is not clear. We  
do know that by the end of the 14th  
century pressures that would lead  

to the Reformation were mounting.  
For whatever reason, by the 15th  

century, the Church had decided that  

witchcraft was a threat to orthodoxy.  
By the end of the century the Pope,  
Innocent VIII, was issuing papal  
bulls, empowering his representa-  
tives to try witches.  

One of his representatives, Jacob  
Springer and Heinrich Kramer, sent  
to try witches in Germany, produced  
Christendom's guide on the theory  
and identification of witches, Mal-  
leus Maleficarum or Hammer of Witches.  
As you can see from the passage  
quoted at the beginning of this  
article, these two were obsessed with  
the witch's sexuality, especially  
the sexuality of the female witches.  
(Was celibacy getting to them?)  

The book also noted witches’ healing  
powers and warned of their knowledge  
of contraception and abortion proce-  
dures.  

Changing men into beasts  
""Now there are, as it is said in the  
Papal Bull, seven methods by which  
they infect with witchcraft the  
venereal act and the conception of  
the womb: First, by inclining the  
minds of men to inordinate passion;  
second, by obstructing their genera-  
tive force; third, by removing the  
members accommodated to that act;  
fourth, by changing men into beasts  
by their magic act; fifth, by de-  
stroying the generative force in  
women; sixth, by procuring abortion;  
seventh, by offering children to the  
devils, besides other animals and  
the fruits of the earth with which  
they work harm.""  

Terrifying as these powers were, I  
wonder if women saw all of them in  
quite the same evil light that the  
two priests did.  

The persecution of witches in this  
country has a short and a somewhat  
less sordid history. The first  

witchcraft trial in the English colo-  

nies for which we have records, oc-  
curred in Windsor, Connecticut in  
1647. During the next fifty years,  
there were a total of about one  
hundred cases out of which thirty-  
eight persons were convicted and  
hanged (not burned). The notorious  
Salem witch trials were different  
from the earlier ones. Occurring at  
the tail end of the witch craze in  
Europe they were examples not of  
isolated accusations and trials, but  
of mass hysteria in a backwater New  
England village. Early in 1692, a  
group of girls age 9 through 19  
accused a woman slave, Tituba, and  
two elderly poor women of having  
bewitched them, causing them to jerk  
and shriek. The slave was beaten in-  
to confession by her master. Those  
accused began to implicate others  
and confess to broomstick rides,  
witches' sabbaths, copulation with  
the devil and so on. By May when  
the governor arrived from Boston,  
several dozen accused witches were  
awaiting trial. The governor ap-  

pointed a special court of laymen  
to try the accused.  

‘Overwhelming’ evidence  

Records still exist of those trials.  
Take for example, the trial of one  
Susanna Martin. The evidence against  
Mistress Martin was overwhelming.  

Her fellow townsman, Bernard Eache,  
testified that:  

""...being in bed on a Lord's Day  
night, he heard a scrambling at the  
window, whereat he then saw Susan-  
na Martin come in and jump down upon  
the floor. She took hold of this  
deponent's feet, and drawing his body  
up unto a heap, she lay upon him  
near two hours; in all which time he  
could neither speak nor stir.""  

Another Salem resident, Robert Dow-  
ner, accused Mistress Martin of witch-  
craft and the following night:  

“as he lay in his bed, there came  
in at the window the likeness of a  
cat, which flew upon him, took  
fast hold of his throat, lay on him  
a considerable while, and almost  
killed him.""  

And one William Brown further testi-  
fied that Susanna often appeared  
to his wife:  

""giving her no little trouble;  
and when she did come, she was  
visited with birds that sorely  
pecked and pricked her; and some-  
times a bunch, like a pullet's egg,  
would rise in her throat, ready to  
choke her...""  

Traditional witch's powers with sexu-  
al overtones. Susanna, as you might  
expect, was found guilty and exe-  
cuted. When the Salem court ad-  
journed, some nineteen or twenty  
persons, mostly women, and two dogs,  
sex unclear, had been hanged.  

Why always women?  

The events in Salem Village have been  
attributed to any number of causes,  
""exhibitionism natural to young  
girls,"" the evils of Puritanism,  
the sociology of a small back-  
water village. But the question  

that interests me is not why witch-  
craft crazes, but why, throughout  
Western history, have the accused  
usually been women?  

To answer that question we have to go  
back, long before the Christian era.  
It is as if men have always seen  
women as a split person. From the  
earliest pre-history when the ferti-  
lity goddess was divided into the  
beneficent great mother and the  

dark, sexually dangerous earth mo-"

Polly Pavek

Two months ago I discovered  
that I love to sing. I have  
been singing for many years;  
when I'm alone, in the bath-  
tub, washing dishes, riding  
in the car, and sometimes I  
sing with friends. I used to  
sing only folk songs, but in  
my recent discovery I  
started to explore rock 'n  
roll, and I try to sing along with  
Aretha, or Bonnie Bramlett,  
Laura Nyro, Carole King,  
Bonnie Raitt, Merry Clayton,  
or Rita Coolidge. These  
women sing about themselves  
(ourselves) with such energy  
in their voices, and strength  
in their souls that they  
have fully converted me to  
singing my own soul. I have  
expanded my singing territory  
from the bathtub, kitchen  
sink, and moving car to the  
sidewalks, the city park, my  
job, and as far as an actual  
live microphone. The less shy  
and fearful I am of public  
places hearing my voice, the  
less fearful I am of myself,  
and I feel like I'm breaking a  
link of the patriarchal chain  
that keeps me from my own free-  
dom.

Now that I enjoy singing so  
much, I want to do something  
with it. I have gone to many  
auditions and met quite a few  
people. Every group I've  
visited has been dominated by  
men, whether they sing folk or  
cock rock. I've met three  
women and about fifteen men at  
various auditions. I also  
discovered that the majority  
of vocal try-outs for rock 'n  
roll bands have been men.

I've wondered about the minor-  
ity of women dealing with  
popular music: is it because  
women hate cock rock, or  
that we can't sing, or that  
we can sing but are too shy in  
the mask of Eve to assert  
ourselves? Personally, I  
despise cock rock and refuse  
to sing or listen to it (which  
presents many problems).  
Luckily I can sing, and I am  
bored hiding out in the bath-  
tub.

One of the three women I  
met was fired from the group  
she had been with because  
she wouldn't cut her hair in  
a shag style, nor wear tinted  
glasses and batty eyelashes.  
The second woman looked like  
Janis Joplin and sang a lot  
of cock 'n roll which pleased  
all the men in the band. The  
third woman is a very versatile  
musician who left a group  
after a month of their pelvic

ego trips. God's death:  
Why do we have to be subjugated  
by electric penises that glory  
in the enslavement of women?

I want to sing with good,  
rhythmic music that comes  
from my womanly soul. I am  
trying to move forward as a  
singer and as a woman; I'm  
practicing and strengthening  
my voice, and just about  
praying that I'll find some  
musicians who won't oppress  
me.

The only people I know  
who don't oppress me are my  
sisters. Yes, I want to sing  
with my sisters. I just drool  
at the image of being on  
stage with women, good music,  
and a happy audience before  
us. I smile with deep pleasure  
as my fantasy grows and there  
are only women on stage at  
Mr. Lucky's and all the women  
working there, who are  
pushed into hot pants by the  
management and eagle-eyed by  
the many heavy-set, American  
flagged bouncers, join them  
and are freed from the ass-  
pinching customers, and then:  
all those women go over to  
the Warehouse and tear down  
all those pictures on the walls,  
because every one of those  
drawings or paintings are of  
nude women. And who knows,  
Tricky Dicky's might even be  
invaded!

Oh, I'm tired of the bathtub,  
it depresses me. I'm sick of  
loud cock rock, it's trying to  
kill me. I want to sing and  
be heard. I know that there  

are many women in Denver who  
can sing, and many women who  
are good musicians. The  

men dominating the music  

world will only allow our songs  
and creativity to develop to  

a limited point where we  
threaten them with real and  
better music, and they will try  
to stop us. Boycott them!

And let's get ourselves together.

Mother Nature is good; she gives

Woman was either the sexless angel

can novelists for two hundred  
years has been the juxtaposition  

of the snow maiden and the dark  
lady. Nathaniel Hawthorne, author  
of the Scarlet Letter, is typical  

in his use of the contrasting  
images. In his Blithedale Romance  
he juxtaposed the dark-haired, sen-  
sual Zenobia (probably modeled on  
Margaret Fuller, an early feminist)  
and the frail blond Priscilla,  

who is Philip Wylie's or Philip  
Roth's ""Mom"" if not the dangerous  
woman in a new guise, emasculating  
her male children as did the ""vagina

of earlier myths. Woman is the

In this article I have made exten-

Deirdre English, ""Witches, Midwives,  
and Nurses, A History of Women  
Healers."" It is available at the new  
women's bookstore, The Woman's

relied on papers written by two of  
my women's history students, Judy  
Matchett's ""Momism: From Philip  
Wylie to Philip Roth” and Dorothy  
Kiernan's, ""Witchcraft: The Role  

of Women in the Witch Craze of the  
16th and 17th Centuries."" Margaret  
Murray in her The God of the Witches  
discusses European witchcraft as  

an ancient, indigenous cult. Norman  
Cohn in the Pursuit of the Millen-  
nium discusses the bizarre sects  

of Medieval Europe. Malleus Male-  
ficarum is in paper. There are  
many histories of witchcraft in the  
English colonies including among  

the most recent, Marion L. Starkey's  
The Devil in Massachusetts and  
Chadwick Hansen, Witchcraft at  
Salem. The theme of the evil  

woman is explained in detail in H.R.  
Hay's The Dangerous Sex. Last, the

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No3_page009.txt,BigMammaRag,,9,"WOMEN'S RIGHTS BY LAW —— the 19th step forward?

The law functions as the skeleton  
of our society. It holds deeply  
rooted mores, prejudices and beliefs  
in a coherent structure.

A revision of the law almost nev-  
er precedes a recognized and strong  
movement manifesting a change in our  
system of values, but rather follows  
such a change. Even when altera-  
tions are made in the laws, if the  
social movement that caused the  
change was not broad enough or deep  
enough, then the new or amended law  
will have little effect. It will be  
ignored or interpreted so strictly  
by the courts that its range becomes  
extremely narrow and thus its power  
negligible.

Two examples of the above would  
be the Fourteenth Amendment of the  
United States Constitution (Equal  
Rights Under the Law) and the Nine-  
teenth Amendment (Giving Women the  
Right To Vote).

The Fourteenth Amendment was  
passed shortly after the Civil War  
and for many years was interpreted  
to apply only to discrimination in-  
volving Blacks. It took decades be-  
fore the U.S. Courts began applying  
the 14th Amendment to any irrational  
discrimination against recognizable  
groups within our society.

After the passage of the 19th  
Amendment giving women the right to  
vote, the women's suffrage movement  
seemed to slowly come to a standstill  
for many years. Women did indeed  
vote, but as far as the law was con-  
cerned, that was about the only  
change for women.

The Justices sitting on our high-  
est Court through their decisions  
over the past century reflected what  
was the predominant attitude in our  
society about a ""woman's place.""

Around 1872, Mrs. Bradwell wanted  
to become a lawyer in the State of  
Illinois. The Illinois Bar Associa-  
tion said no. She appealed and the  
case was decided by the United States  
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court up-  
held the Illinois Bar Association.  
The Court said through Justice Bradley:

""Man is, or should be, woman's  
protector and defender. The natu-  
ral and proper timidity and deli-  
cacy which belongs to the female  
sex evidently unfits it for many  
of the occupations of civil life.

The constitution of the family or-  
ganizations, which is founded in  
the divine ordinance, as well as  
in the nature of things, indicates  
the domestic sphere as that which  
properly belongs to the domain and  
functions of womanhood. The har-  
mony, not to say identity, of in-  
terests and views, which belong,  
or should belong, to the family  
institution is repugnant to the  
idea of a woman adopting a dis-  
tinct and independent career from  
that of her husband.""

The actual legal basis for the  
decision was based upon a married wo-  
man's inability to make and enforce  
contracts. Only her husband could do  
that. Therefore the court was wor-  
ried about how a married woman could  
effectively contract with and for her  
clients.

The Court went on to say: ""The  
paramount destiny and mission of  
woman are to fulfill the noble be-  
nign offices of wife and mother.  
This is the law of the Creator.""

It is ironic to discover how the  
protective laws for women were ap-  
proved by the U.S. Supreme Court.  
The approval of such laws was con-  
sidered to be a step in the right di-  
rection for the labor movement.

In 1905 New York had in effect a  
law applying to both men and women  
which stated that no worker could be  
required to work in a bakery more  
than 60 hours a week or 10 a day.  
That law was challenged and struck  
down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The  
law in so far as it concerned men was  
unconstitutional as a violation of  
the right to contract and due process.  
Note that the law was unconstitutional  
only as to men. The door was left  
open.

In approximately 1908 the Oregon  
Legislature passed a law limiting the  
hours a woman could work in a factory  
to 10 a day. The law was challenged,  
but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld  
the law and stated in part:

""The two sexes differ in struc-  
ture of body, in the functions to  
be performed by each, in the amount  
of physical strength, in the capa-  
city for long-continued labor, par-  
ticularly when done standing, the  
influence of vigorous health upon  
the future well-being of the race,  
the self-reliance which enables  
one to assert full rights, and in  
the capacity to maintain the  
struggle for subsistence. This  
difference justifies a difference  
in legislation, and upholds that  
which is designed to compensate  
for some of the burdens which rest  
upon her.”

The critical language in this case  
(Muller vs. Oregon) follows:  
""...Though limitations upon per-  
sonal and contractual rights may  
be removed by legislation, there  
is that in her disposition and  
habits of life which will operate  
against a full assertion of those  
rights....Differentiated by these  
matters from the other sex, she is  

by Kathy Bonham

properly placed in a class by her-  
self, and legislation designed for  
her protection may be sustained,  
even when like legislation is not  
necessary for men, and could not  
be sustained.""

This language has been used up to  
the present time to justify a legal  
double standard for men and women.  
Thus sex became a valid basis for  
classification and a valid basis for  
differentiation.

Protective laws sprang up in every  
state ""protecting"" women from long  
hours, from lifting heavy weights and  
from such things as going into mines  
and so forth. In the first case,  
Bradwell vs. Illinois, the Fourteenth  
Amendment equal protection argument  
was not even raised.

The entire concept brought over to  
this country from England of women  
as chattels (personal property) be-  
longing either to their fathers or  
their husbands was enhanced by such  
decisions handed down by our high  
court. Up until the last decade or  
so, women in almost all states suf-  
fered from legal disabilities such as  
the right to contract by herself,  
the right to have certain kinds of em-  
ployment, the right to control her  
property or indeed even to have pro-  
perty, the right to go into business  
on her own, the right to be on a  
jury and on and on.

Women and children and idiots have  
been treated in very much the same  
way in our laws. The basis of the  
theory behind this grouping is that  
women, children and idiots must be  
protected and special attention must  
be paid to them. This attitude has  
brought some curious results.

For instance, many states up until  
a decade ago had special sentencing  
arrangements for women. The laws of  
a particular state would set forth  
the minimum and maximum sentence that  
one could be given for being convicted  
of a particular crime. An example  
would be 4 to 15 years.

All of this was done in the name  
of helping the woman, just as many  
of our laws regarding the insane and  
juveniles are made for protection  
but more often than not result in  
far greater harshness than a ""normal""  
man would receive from a standard  
sentence for the same or a worse  
crime.

Most of these kinds of laws re-  
garding sentencing of women have  
been repealed or held unconstitution-  
al in recent years. The 14th Amend-  
ment has been the primary vehicle  
for such declaration of unconstitu-  
tionality.

The part the law has played in  
maintaining much of the myth and  
prejudice about women is considerable,  
complex and revealing. The above  
barely touches upon the meat of the  
subject.

How our society finally reached  
the point of passing an Equal Rights  
Amendment for women and just what if  
anything that Amendment will do is  
an interesting investigation and a  
lengthy one.

BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No3_page010.txt,BigMammaRag,,10,"WOMEN'S POLITICAL CAUCUS

The Colorado Women's Political Caucus (CWPC) meetings Sat. March 10 at Temple Square seemed on the surface to be a dull affair. Not only was the meeting strong-armed by a presiding officer and a parliamentarian, but the agenda included such exhilarating topics as the budget and by-laws!

But tucked away in the back pages of CWPC's rulebook are some exciting concepts, to-wit:

1. U.S. women have held more than 70% of the delegate positions at the precinct convention level and less than 4% at the state level, which means that women have had the deciding vote in electing men to represent them. A little political consciousness raising is in order here!

2. Women are beginning to recognize themselves as a voting block transcending traditional party affiliations. To quote Republican State Rep. Carol Tempest, the same people voted for her that voted for Democrat Pat Schroeder.

3. To organize a self-conscious women's vote is to give women power. It's a lot easier to negotiate when you can say with credibility, ""There are 40,000 voting women waiting to hear your decision.”

A conversation with outgoing CWPC chairperson Mary Ellen Gallagher revealed that CWPC is just getting firmly on its feet as a non-partisan women's caucus. Last year during election efforts, separate caucuses formed inside each party, with the Democrats' CWPC emerging as the strongest. (50% of Colorado’s delegates to the national Democratic convention were women.)

When the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) convened in Houston last February, two groups attended from Colorado, the Democratic caucus and the non-partisan caucus. Since that time, much has gone on behind the scenes to resolve the problem of party co-existence within the Colorado caucus to make it an organization that any woman - Republican, Democrat, or Independent -- would feel comfortable in. Some of the tedium evident at Saturday's meeting was directly related to such efforts, Ms. Gallagher said.

In reference to NWPC's convention, she cited as ""frustrating” the fact that there was “absolutely no parliamentary procedure."" The assembly spent four hours trying to resolve a very minor detail, she said. However, out of the chaos, women gained new confidence in themselves. ""You'd hear someone speaking who didn't know a whole lot more than you did, and the next thing you knew, you'd be up there yourself having your say before the crowd.""

The ""superstars"" stayed in the background: women like Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, and Gloria Steinem made themselves available to the delegates, sharing their expertise, but they were deliberately low-key so that new leaders would emerge.

One inspiring element of the NWPC convention that Ms. Gallagher ""didn't anticipate"" was a ""sense of history,"" of being a part of a movement, not only in rhetoric but in actual, solid, practical fact.

Bringing that inspiration to the grassroots level involves a lot of hard work. Current priorities include: (1) expanding membership to establish a true power block; (2) getting women elected to all levels in government (""If you want girls in shop classes in high school, you'll get funds for the equipment a lot faster if there are women on the school board.""); and possibly (3) researching the effect on women of negative political maneuvers like Nixon's welfare cutbacks.

Ms. Gallagher, who is more comfortable herself outside the present political system, nevertheless believes that an organized women's effort utilizing present party structures is needed at this time. She pointed out that, although some feminists are “liberating themselves"" by creating autonomous lifestyles outside the system, there are many women oriented to traditional political structures for whom a women's caucus provides a first rallying point for feminist issues. Moreover, women of all political leanings -- inside and outside the system -- who realize the need to join with other women in a common effort look to the caucus for the necessary structure to make this realization a powerful reality.

A few facts: President of NWPC is Frances (Sissy) Farenthold of Texas. Newly elected CWPC officers are President Marye Scharf, Vice President Estelle Firkany, Secretary Marilynne Siggerstaff, and Treasurer Bonnie Andrikopoulos. CWPC's Board of Directors: Jean Bain, Mary Ellen Gallagher, Karen Paget, Lydia Pena, Cynthia Small, and Rory Zahorek. Membership mailing address: 560 Clarkson.

COLORADO LEGISLATION PENDING

HB 1129. Discrimination in Consumer Credit. Pending in Senate Business Affairs Committee. Senator Garnsey would be besieged with letters and telephone calls.  
HB 1128. Discrimination in Housing. Senate State Affairs, expected from committee in April.  
SB 53. Child Care Guide- problem.  
HB 1258. Requesting $800,000 Child Care Appropriations. Being introduced by Rep. Chuck Howe.  

(Above information from Bonnie Andrikopoulos, NOW's lobbyist. There is also a bill being pursued by Rep. Carol Tempest to equalize legal contractual age, but its number was not available at this printing.)

U.S. LEGISLATION PENDING

There are two anti-abortion bills before the U.S. Congress at present - HJ 261 and HJ 284. Each bill would “Guarantee the right to life"" of the fetus. One states that it would guarantee this right “from the moment of conception,"" while the other says ""from conception."" Both bills must be defeated.

The Right-to-Life people are well organized, so we've got to get going. Write to every U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative, whether or not you are one of her/his constituents. Pat Schroeder says the Right-to-Life people have gained access to her office several times at night to leave an aborted fetus on her desk. She also said she has received over 2000 letters urging her support of these bills. As you can see, the Right-to-Life group will resort to any sort of emotionalism. We've got to make our position known to Congresswoman Schroeder and the others.

Memo"
BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No3_page011.txt,BigMammaRag,,11,"|

Dear Sisters:

The first two issues of  
“Big Mama Rag"" are fantastic!  
All of us “women"" are in  
desperate need of our own  
paper if for no other reason  
than to know that I am not  
the only one like me...and may-  
be I'm not “sick” after all...  
and hey, this is what I think  
or feel! Also the idea of  
“women"" defining and spelling  
our own name and on OUR OWN  
terms is really important!  
There was an article in the  
last issue which I would like  
to comment on...""Books for Kids?  
Careful Now..."" My only  
objection was in the terminology  
""Kids"" are People! Just like  
you and me, the only difference  
MAYBE is that they are a  
little shorter. They  
have been provided for,  
oppressed, controlled, shielded,  
protected too...""Watch what  
you say in front of the ‘children'!""  
They, like us, have not  
been allowed to BE, to THINK,  
to FEEL, to take their  
OWN LIVES INTO THEIR OWN HANDS!  
Just as I do not like, in  
fact REVOLT against being  
referred to in one of the many  
condescending terms used for  
woman (e.g. ""chick,"" ""broad,""  
""baby,"" ""honey"") I in turn  
will NOT use condescending terms  
towards my younger sisters and  
peers.  

We have to learn to respect  
each other as PEOPLE, no  
matter what age, race, sex.  
All oppressed persons MUST work  
together to change this system  
which tyrannizes us all!

In struggle,

Carolyn Agosta  
P.S. Suggestion:  
to read Dialectic of Sex  
by Shulamith Firestone - she  
puts it all together!

LETTERS HOME TO  

MAMA  

I find the writing,  
printing, and graphics of the  
BMR all above average. Com-  
mendable. On the other hand  
I find your editorial somewhat  
unworthy of you. ""A woman  
(or a man) who is thinking for  
and about herself"" often  
develops into a selfish, small  
creature. I believe the level  
of vocabulary, attention to  
grammar, cubistic artwork,  
layout and printing of the Rag  
demonstrate the above average  
skills and education of your  
staff. If so, might you not  
ask yourselves why this out-  
pouring of effort in print,  
which you might well spend else-  
where in individual advancement?  
A labor of love? Pure altruism  
in favor of less privileged  
females? I doubt it.

More favored than the  
average U.S. woman, you  
nevertheless feel inadequate  
either to attempt high attain-  
ment in the admittedly unsatis-  
factory and male-dominated goal  
reward systems of American  
society, or to strike out on  
your own courses, securely  
tied to your egos as you  
cleave between the Scylla of  
irrelevance and the Charybdis  
of blank failure.

Are you not trying mainly  
to build up your own idea of  
your self-worth? May I suggest  
that this is a valid goal, and  
that the B.M.R. adopt an  
unwritten editorial policy of  
building the ego of many  
women up to the point equal to  
their abilities, a policy of  
encouraging women to reach  
their full potential in the  
intellectual and financial and  
artistic terms dictated by our  
society? Wouldn't this be a  
more positive approach than the  
somewhat narcissistic policies  
you advocate? (After all just  
how many women or men feel  
obliged ""to write about their  
feelings, ideas?"")

Such a policy as I suggest  
though would require discipline.  
You could not go spouting off  
about Pat Schroeder. Your  
interviewers would have to  
strive to ask her questions  
which bring out her sterling  
qualities, to draw out her  
motivations so other women  
might identify similar forces  

in themselves.  

BMR:  

Thanks for the copy of  
""Big Mama Rag."" I really  
appreciated it and best of  
luck to you and the paper.  

Pat Schroeder  

We were happy to see Den-  
ver's first television series  
produced specifically for and  
about women, Anatomy of Woman  
(KRMA Ch. 6) has stirred up a  
lot of feeling and opinion,  
both positive and negative.  
Most important is the fact that  
many women have cared deeply  
about this program and wanted  
it to speak for them.

We would like to hear your  
opinions and your suggestions  
for an upcoming article. It is  
our understanding that the show  
may be expanded into a nation-  
wide series, a prospect we look  
forward to with enthusiasm. If  
this should happen, additional  
funding would hopefully open the  
door for implementing any con-  
structive criticism we could  
generate.

So please think about it,  
and let us hear from you.

I would have to believe  

motherhood ... .«::  

Then one day I read ""The  
Politics of Housework,"" per-  
haps the most important article  
I've ever read. I suddenly  
had the following realization.  
David and I certainly shared  
the Amanda tasks but I was the  
one responsible for her. I  
was the one who thought  
of what to do and then delegated  
the responsibility. I  
knew when she was about to run  
out of clothes, when to change  
her crib sheet, and when to  
give the relief bottle of  
apple juice. And then I  
reevaluated our parenthood  
existence. We both uncon-  
sciously acted upon my ultimate  
responsibility for the house-  
work, and, later, for the child.  

Fights, misunderstanding  
and anger began, and was I  
alone. Here I was with what  
most people considered a  
model husband, and I had always  
felt lucky (read: superior).  
I had had talks the previous  
spring with a woman who, with  
her husband, had explicitly  
delegated jobs. I had felt  
David and I had a ""greater""  
mutual understanding and we  
didn't need such artificial job  
outlines. Our commitment to  
equality was enough. We  

started to assign specific jobs.  

But I resented that I was the  
one who always thought of what  
to do. We tried to change  
that, but I had been socialized  
well and so unfortunately, had  
David. Our struggles were  
those that many sisters have  
gone through about housework,  
but complicated by Amanda's  
total presence and dependence.  
Our struggles were really  
hard. They were our first ones  
specifically around women's  
issues, and a few words of  
awareness do not break up old  
patterns. The change is  
painful and scary when you feel  
like a fanatic unappreciative  
bitch - but compared to anyone  

else's situation I was lucky.  

My angry feelings turned  

inward, repressed and sometimes  
expressed to David, but to  
nobody else. I didn't want to  
admit failure. ""If it's so bad,  
why did you have a baby in the  
first place,"" I imagined  

others would say to me.  

I felt guilty for resenting  
David. I felt I should  
appreciate his helpfulness.  

I'm frankly not sure what he  
was feeling. Frustration, I  
imagine. Every time he turned

about how much Amanda's room

we never dusted our room.  

But she's an infant, and the  
germs are out to get her. All  
should be sterile and as  

clean as the pictures in the  
books. I probably felt more  
should be done than was neces-

Maria Troy is a would-be college teacher with an MA in English from the University of Colorado who can't find a job. She presently manages an apartment building, which gives her free time to pursue alternative educational situations, among other interests. Don't get me wrong. I am just like you. But when a society has become dehumanized, treating the symptoms just aggravates the disease. Want an easy outlet for frustrations? Blame it on the men. Blame it on the society that is run by men. But who has raised all the children and taught them the values of that society? That's more than half of the dirty work, right there. Men and women today are victims of a society we have been stupid enough to acquiesce to for too long. And now, do you think the truly vital business of the world is carried on in office buildings? Are we seeking equality so that we, too, can struggle with the avarice and the ulcers that plague Seventeenth Street? 

You say you used to be an oppressed sex object? But you gave all your frilly dresses to the Salvation Army? You burned your bra and now you scorn any woman who wears one? When an MCP whistles at you in the park, you flip him the bird? You're ashamed of having been Snowflake Queen in high school? When somebody calls you ""Miss Smith,"" you snap to attention, stick out your chin and thunder, ""That's MS Smith, buddy!""? 

You've come the wrong way. Ultimately, the issue is not a sexual one, nor is it a political one. The structure must be changed, but if the substance is not changed, the difference is irrelevant. We can win equality in the courts, but we can't legislate the human spirit. Where do we start? Not by pointing fingers there and there, but by recognizing our dignity and responsibilities as human beings. 

What about you? Are you your own oppressor? Do you blame your parents for the way you turned out? Do you blame society? Men? When are you going to start taking responsibility for the way you are? Have you got a chip on your shoulder? Will you be angry with me for saying that Women's Lib is a white, Baby.

It's all together crazy now

How much we've played the fools

The time we've spent “prettying up"" 
With silks and furs and jewels.

Faces plastered head to chin

And hands that squish of lanolin 
Tresses golden now are raven 
Appendages are glossily shaven. 

Sultry eyes of Maybelline 
FDS shouts ""I am clean"" 
Underarms are sprayed and dry 
Certs stops bad breath when I sigh. 

Diet pills or skipping meals 
No matter how the stomach feels 
Ought to mean a dress size eight 
For Friday's party looking great. 

Perfume's essence from Paris, France 
Could make the difference at a dance 
Even if your zits won't heal 
Use Ultra Brite with sex appeal. 

If your body is aching, groaning 
While the other YOU is angrily moaning. 
""Something here, it's just not right” 
Is this really ME going out tonight? 

It's nice to be the way you are 
And not the one from out of a jar 
Zits and bulges, mouse brown hair 
Expensive clothing that you wear 
Doesn't make you more aware 
Doesn't make your ""loved one” care. 

Since You Won't Know Any Other Way, Mister

I'm going to drill a screw through your temples 
Just so there's enough air for your brains to 
slide around in uncomfortably 

I'm going to drive a spike at the top of your head 
Just so there's hole enough for all the beautiful women 
of the world to stuff rags into 

It only stifles the inner glow 
So stand back sister, let it grow 

You'll like the feeling when you WANT TO JOIN A CONSCIOUSNESS- 
RAISING GROUP??? 

Enough I hope that you will share 
The knowledge that the “gimmick"" is done 
And the magnificent YOU has finally won

There is only one real  
change that can take place,  
and it is a change that takes  
place in each individual.  
There is a moral to be drawn  
here, even though morals have  
fallen from grace. It concerns  

the dignity of being a human  
being and how we should respect  
that dignity in others. It  

has been made a maxim in  

every great religion or  
philosophy that has ever lived.  
It begins,  

in the world. ""Do  

unto others...""  

ACTUAL SPEECH OF WOMEN'S  

I am not a liberated woman.  
I do not know of one woman in  
this world who is liberated -  
being female we are all equally  
subject to the same inherent  
evils in our everyday living  
situations. To believe that  
the freedom of women focuses on  
individual solutions to “our  
problems"" is just another rusty  
door which should've been  
kicked off its hinges by all  

of us years ago.  

When I walk down the street  
I am just as likely to be  
leered at, whistled at, or  
made the butt of some insensi-  
tive joke as my mother is, or  
my next-door neighbor, or the  
woman who works as a doctor  
or the one who performs  
janitorial services. When any  
woman applies for a job which  
has previously been held mainly  
by men, she is just as likely  
to be hassled about it whether  
she identifies with Margaret  
Mitchell or with Kate Millett.  
There are no individually free  
fish in an aquarium.  

No one today would think of  
telling a black person that her  
or his discrimination is an  
individual dilemma. ""Pull  
yourself up by your bootstraps""  
has pretty much been buried  
under the pile of old books  

where it belonged in the first  

place. It is also generally  
acknowledged that racism is  

the direct result of someone's  
huge obnoxious thumb being  
pressed down upon someone  
else's vulnerable if unwill-  
ing head.  

Yet as women we still fall  
into the trap that we are our  
own thumb-pressers, that the  
snapping of the strings  
which bind us can be accompli-  
shed with thousands of personal-  
ly monogrammed scissors,  
that the problem is ultimately  
one of ""human liberation"" (and  
look who's already ahead by  
the very nature of the word).  

The liberation of women  
does not mean exchanging  
female stereotypes for male  
stereotypes. We should not  
wish to adopt either the  
feminine or the masculine roles  
as they are presently conceived -  
Migrant Mary  
Homemaker vs. Mr. Ulcerated  

Maybe I Can Answer  

Mariame Waters  

Walter Wall Street. Further-  
more, the liberation of women  
does not mean that our publi-  
cations are similar to the  
male-dominated women's  
magazines - e.g. Family  
Runaround, Redneck Book,  
Cashmopolitan, Vague, Women‘s  
Daydreams, etc. Feminist  
publications do not seek to  
make ""women's place"" more  
comfortable and easy (e.g.  
how to scrub the floor in 5  
minutes instead of 25) but  
rather to question and explore  
the kinds of problems which  
affect all of us as women.  
Pointing the finger  
where it rightfully belongs is  
an extremely necessary first  
step for any second-class  
individual or group. The  
black person who was denied the  
bank presidency because of  
race is not individually  
responsible for that denial.  
The woman who was molested by  
her father as a child is not  
personally accountable for the  
confused way she may always  
view sexuality because of that  
molestation. The feminist who  
sees that she lives in a  
society so lop-sidedly in  
favor of the other sex that she  
is always looking up from the  
bottom of the see-saw must  
justifiably be angry with whom  
she sees sitting at the top.  
Nevertheless, this revela-  
tion is only a first step and  
we as women must constantly  
work together to carry over  

the realities of our political  
sexual, and economic (etc.)  

discoveries (and what are  
""human issues"" composed of  
after all?) into our everyday  
living situations. Only  

then can we begin to make a  
revolution with our lives.  

But by continuing to believe  
that every woman is personally  
accountable for the less-than-  
someone role that's always  
been thrust upon us we may all  
end up in the playground -  
together but alone at the  
bottom of our respective see-  
saws. There is a moral to be  
drawn here and while it may not  
be quite so old and venerated  
as some it is certainly as  
worthy. It begins, ""United  

we stand...""  

SUFFRAGE MEETING  
We will have what men have.  
It may not be much, but we mean to have  
it. If we cannot have it through our  
Organization, we will have it through our  

Combination, or without, if necessary. We  
refuse to be poked in the gallery any more,  
but insist on being placed on the floor of  
the House. That drunken loafer in the house  
says, “Down with the petticoats."" I say  
""Up with the petticoats and down with the  
pants."" Then things would be visible in their  
true light. We must get together; so who  
as long as  
women are split up as we are the men will  
always be on top.  

am I waiting for  
to “give"" me  
that moment? and pour out...

Motherhood continued here. The usual household tasks  

were now shared by five of us.  
‘How could I complain that David  

didn't read the childcare  
books? I remember pressuring  
him to read pages so and so,  
and he would, eventually.  
After all, he was working hard  
in school and I had none of  
those pressing commitments.  

(I was registered, but not a  
student in practice.)  

During Amanda's first four  
months I was involved with  
the Woman's Caucus of my  
graduate program. I had a  
dim realization that that con-  
tact was very important for my  
sanity. It was my only con-  
tact outside of my world of  
Amanda, David and the house.  
Winter quarter began and I  
took some classes. I clung to  
that identity and ego-tripped on  
the fact I technically never  
dropped out of school.  

I remember tripping on how  
atypical (read: superior) I  
was. A lot of my words to  
other people, especially women's  
liberation women, were partially  
to impress. I bragged about  
my negative fantasies of  
killing Amanda and didn't let  
myself feel many positive or  
""typical"" ones. I dug acting  
cool and indifferent - being  
a liberated mother. I dug  
nursing Amanda so casually and  
successfully. At the time I  
wasn't conscious of bragging.  

I did have fantasies of escape  
from this drama, of feeling it  
was all a temporary game.  

After all, we hadn't established  
any mutual love relationship.  

I knew it didn’t matter to  
Amanda who was holding her, but  
she did prefer my lactating  
breasts to the bottle. As we  
got into a routine, David and I  
could talk and reflect, as op-  

posed to react, more. I  

resented doing more than my  
exact time allotted share of  
baby care and kept keen watch  
on the division of labor.  

When I wrote some papers for  
school and David seemed willing  
to do more than his share, I  
was amazed and guilty because  
I knew I wasn't willing to  

do the same for him. God, I  
thought I was selfish, but I  
kept my principles because I  
felt a vague, unspoken support  
from some women in my life.  

I was angry and jealous  
of David. He not only had  
the rewards of parenthood, he  
had work he could relate to.  
One reason I nursed as long as  
I did was to keep myself as  
Amanda's most special person.  
It was also difficult to  
share the one area of compe-  
tence I felt I had. Once  
Amanda fell off the bed while  
David was in the room with her.  
One of my gut reactions was it  
wouldn't have happened if I  
had been there. I rushed in  
when David called for me and  
silently felt, I can comfort  
her better than anyone.  

After all, if she prefers  
David, what else do I have?  

I felt very rigid about  
equalization of Amanda's respon-  
sibilities. Because I didn't  
have anything else satisfying  
of my own, and because of a  
guilt about what kind of mother  
I am, I'd slip into doing more  
than my share.  

David didn't feel as  
isolated or have the desperate  
desire to talk about everyday,  

issues of baby care. One  
reason he didn't was that being  
a father was another something  
he did, not something he ""was.""  
Being a mother was who I was.  
Somewhere in me I felt  
unrecognized, David was the  
focus of attention by being  
so nice and so responsible for  
his child. “Oh, Alice, he is  
amazing and you're so lucky  
because most men don't have  
that special feeling and intui-  
tion for babies,"" said my  
mother and her friends. He  
got the public accolades from  
me and my friends as well, for  
what was expected from me.  
Again I was being defined  
in terms of a man. People  
looked at us and said how  
lucky I was to have David around.  
It still makes me angry when  
I think about it because it's  
still going on.  

David realized that he re-  
lated to a lot of taking care  
of Amanda in terms of a burden.  
I felt the same way. David  
and I are in a world of child-  
less graduate students and I  
was jealous of them and  
embarrassed to say so because  
I would make public my help-  
lessness and sense of failure.  
I feel guilty even in writing  
this today because I am think-  
ing ""what does this say about  
my getting into the joys of  
motherhood?"" Those moments of  
joy were there, but they were  
never long lasting.  

Somewhere in me I feel  
Amanda is cheated - to have a  
mother who is so totally ambi-  
valent, who finds her boring  
in long stretches of hours,  
who resents her constant deman-  
ding dependence. When I  
viewed her as an object to be  
responsible for, my negative  
feelings and fantasies rushed  
in. When I'm taking care of  
her it’s either her trip or  
ours together. Perhaps I can  
read something light or listen  
to music, but there's no way  
I can be into anything or any-  
body else in a deep way.  

What about any positive  
feelings? Sometimes they come  
out of guilt, when I'm wishing  
I was away from her. It  
seemed like I was always schem-  
ing to get away from her. Then  
I realize she herself is really  
cute and innocent and it's  
not her fault she's on this  
earth. She's just a cute  
Amanda panda hangin’ in. Then  
there are the times that I  
really do want to be with her  
and I get into her babiness -  
her constant changing, explo-  
ration, joy, enthusiasm and  
honesty.  

I do dig her and my love  
grows as she does, but in this  
journal I want to stress the  
difficult aspect. Those  
positive moments for me - the  
energy for them is only freed  
up when I don't objectify  
her as a chore to be endured.  
And I don't have to do that  
when we're together out of  
choice. I imagine she knows  
those times I don’t dig being  
with her. And I do believe  

the liberation of children is  
intimately connected to the  
liberation of women to be our  
own selves."
