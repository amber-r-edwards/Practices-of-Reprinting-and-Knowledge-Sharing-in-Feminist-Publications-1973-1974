My name is Mary Louise  
Aragon. On March 4, 1973 I  
was sentenced to the Colora-  
do Women’s Correctional In-  
stitution. My crime was  
aggravated robbery and my  
sentence was indeterminate  
to 10 years. This action ended  
a crime and drug experience  
that had drawn itself out to  
almost ten years of my life.  
On March 6, I was transported  
to CWCI to start paying my  
debt to society.  

My encounters with the law  
by that time had been many  
and I remember thinking how  
degrading and inhumane the  
conditions were in the city  
and county jails. The toilets  
and showers are in plain view,  
giving no privacy at all. Some  
people might say “What the  
Hell?” but when you think  
about it put yourself in that  
position trying to use the  
toilet with a room full of  
people watching your every  
move. So far the conditions  
are minimal compared to what  
a woman is subjected to at the  
prison.  

Upon arriving I was greeted  
by a cold, fenced building that  
was isolated from the town at  
the end of a normal rural  
street lined with typical single  
family wood framed houses.  
The guards all wear white  
uniforms with name tags. The  
name tags show only the last  
name with the initial of their  
first name. That told me that  
they were to be referred to as  
Ms. or Miss or Mrs. Although  
they knew that my name was  
Ms. Aragon they called me  
Mary, which automatically  
tells me that they place  
themselves at a higher posi-  
tion than the inmates. I was  
officially accepted at the  
prison as I signed some  

papers. Up to this point prison  
was just a word to me but now  
I was led through electrically  
controlled doors which  
slammed behind me. From  
that point on I knew I was in  
prison although I can recall  
times when it was comparable  
to a concentration camp or  
even a nursery.  
Prison as Medicine  

Never having been in prison  
before I was somewhat fearful  
of what might happen to me. I  
had heard many stories about  
prison and the physical abuse  
that one might receive while  
being there. But the building  
was fairly new and very clean  
and it was almost like being in  
a hospital. Well to my surprise  
there was very little physical  
abuse. But in its place were  
far more dangerous methods  
of abuse, dehumanization,  
physical and sexual depriva-  
tion, loss of identity, and  
failure of identification.  

My first day in isolation  
(where all new prisoners go)  
was spent in awe of my  
environment. My personal  
feelings at that time were of  
resentment, anger, loneliness,  
fear, and alienation from the  
whole world - and a good deal  
of self-pity. I had never placed  
any emphasis on just being  
able to touch another person  
but during the next two weeks  
the only interaction I had with another  
human being was when I was  
given tests by the doctor, or  
the guard. Often the guard  
would give medication that  
only a qualified nurse was  
supposed to give.  

I reflected a lot on my past  
and my family and I can say  
that at that time I desperately  
needed to talk to someone. I  
really needed a feeling of  

some kind of self-worth. But  
unfortunately there was none.  
So, consequently, by the time  
that I got out of isolation I was  
more than ready to accept any  
member of the prison peer  
group who would at least  
listen to some of my frustrations.  
I needed to tell someone that  
just because I broke the law I  
was still a human being and  
not some kind of an animal to  
be caged up and forgotten.  

As I said earlier, my  
involvement with the criminal  
justice system had been  
extensive, but one of the  
things that has bothered me  
most is that in spite of all the  
classifying, testing, and diag-  
nosing no one ever asked me  
why I did what I did. I guess  
that’s not part of what  
correction is about.  

After two weeks in isolation  
I was given a room in the  
north wing. I was now upper  
north 3 - number 41654. By this time  
my nerves were at a breaking  
point. I spent a lot of time in  
my room which is identical to  
isolation rooms. The only  
differences were a small throw  
rug, bedspread, a small desk  
like table, a closet, and the  
door was only locked from  
10:00 pm to 7:00 am.  

The Rules  

I was given a small book  
which supposedly contained  
rules of the prison. I remem-  
ber thumbing through the  
book and landing on a page  
that said something like no  
moustaches or long side  
burns. Then I realized that the  
book was probably for the  
men’s prison. Then I found the  
page that related to the  
women's institution. The rules  
on that page seemed to be  
relatively simple and per-  
tained mostly to mail, and  

visiting rules.  

But as the days dragged on  
I found that there were many  
unwritten rules that apply to  
some of the people some of  
the time and to some of the  
people all of the time. All in all  
I’d say that there were more  
than 200 of these unwritten  
rules and they are changeable  
on a day-to-day or shift-to-shift  
basis. One rule is that you  
can’t have bananas or cucum-  
bers. Another is that you can’t  
go into anyone else’s room at  
all. You can't hold hands with  
visitors. At the men’s visiting  
room they can hold hands.  
Dumb rules that you never  
know if you’re breaking or not,  
but if you do they'll write it up  
and put it in your file and then  
when you come in front of the  
parole board they'll read all  
this “bad girl” stuff and you  
don’t get parole.  

One of the things impressed on  
the women at CWCI is that  
they are ladies and are  
expected to act like ladies.  
But every day I would hear a  
guard tell a grown woman “you  
know that’s a no-no.” Sometimes  
you would get put in lock-up for  
breaking a rule in addition to  
being written up. Lock-up is  
being locked in your room after  
supper and not getting to  
watch TV. I used to get to the  
point where I’d say rules,  
rules, rules, there must be a  
rule for everything in this  
place and if there’s not one,  
believe me, one would be  
made up.  

Stomach Nerve Pills  

Almost all of the women  
take some kind of medication  
there. Of course it’s all  
prescribed legally but is often  
given by a matron who might  
not know what she's doing.  
You almost have to have  
tranquilizers to cope. Living  
there is a constant, constant  
bullshit thing with the same  
people 24 hours a day. You  
worry about your kids. Lots of  
people aren’t the easiest  
people to get along with. A lot  
of vulgarity goes down and  
lots of time you feel like  
hauling off and punching  
someone, but you know if you  
do you'll be put in the hole.  

The hole is underneath the  
isolation area. It's in the  
basement of the basement.  
There are three small cells:  
Two have toilets and matres-  
ses with three solid walls and  
one wall of bars. The third one  
just has a hole in the floor -  
nothing else. No one was ever  
put in there while I was there.  
But I heard that two women  
who tried to escape in 1970, I  
think, were put down there for  
30 days.  

One of the most strictly  
enforced rules there is no  
body contact. YOU CANNOT  
TOUCH ANOTHER PERSON  
FOR ANY REASON. Even  
when you hear that you are  
going to get out or when  
another woman needs to be  
comforted. I'd be told “Mary,  
you know that’s a no-no” they  
treat you like a two-year-old.  
To people on the outside it  
doesn't seem like anything  
not to be allowed to touch  
another person, but for a  
person to feel the impact of  
what I’m saying try going for a  
whole day without touching  
another person or showing  
your feelings physically. And  
then multiply that by months  
or years and you would know  
what a rule like no body  
contact does to you.  

While I was there I worked  
on the yard crew. I got to mow  
the grass and sometimes I’d  
be on this little tractor cutting  
the lawn and I would go crazy  
driving like a nut making hand  
signals. It would help me to  
forget where I was. You know,  
a woman is made up of many  
things and one of the heaviest  
things is emotion. If it is  
suppressed it just surfaces at  
another time.  

The recreation is not very  
good. They have hula-hoops  
and ping-pong tables and you  
can play baseball but there is  
no gym to really let off steam  
and keep yourself in shape  
from the starches you eat. But  
once we really had fun. It was  
on Labor Day when we asked  
to have a picnic in the yard.  
We were going to do all the  
planning and all the work so  
that there would be nothing

Letters Home to Mama

Dear Big Mama Rag:

In your August issue you
reported the story on Big
Mama Rag’s application for
funding with the Denver
Sustaining Fund. You stated:
“We deeply appreciate the
support and help we received
from the many community
women who attended the July
10 meeting of the DSF and
from Kathy DePaulo and Jim
McNulty of the board of
directors of the DSF.” Jim
McNulty was the only one of
the “boys” who supported Big
Mama’s proposal. I would
appreciate it if you would
point out in your next issue
that Jim McNulty is a member
of the Board of Directors of
the DSF as a representative of
the Gay Coalition of Denver.
And on the issue of BMR, he
was specifically urged to vote
for the proposal and to
support it vigorously.

At the previous board
meeting of the Gay Coalition

(a predominantly gay men’s
organization) we unanimously
voted that Jim take the above
course of action at the DSF
meeting. This is based upon
our support of a strong
Women’s Movement in Denver
which we perceive as our
allies in the struggle against
male heterosexual sexism that
oppresses both gays and
women. We understand your
appreciation for Jim individu-
ally, but there is also a gay
organization behind him who
sent him to the meeting with
specific instructions. It is no
coincidence that the only
male support was gay male
support.
Jerry Gerash,
President of the Gay
Coalition of Denver

Dear Sisters;

I just received the August
issue of BMR and would like
to comment on your “policy
statement” regarding Lesbian
baiting.

I think the statement is one
of the most beautiful, sisterly
and strong statements of its
kind that I have ever read
coming out of the women’s
liberation movement — and I
have been around for many
years.

If all women in the
movement felt as you did,
we’d be centuries ahead of
where we are — and we'd be
well on our way. The
statement made my day — no
— it made my week! Right on,
sisters,

in sisterhood,

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Dear Big Mama,

In your July issue, there
was an article about Chicana
welfare rights. I appreciated
your coverage of the concerns
of minority women. It’s
important that we understand
what’s going on with other
women. I think this article, as
well as others in the same
issue, brought some things
home to me that I hadn't
known before.

However, one of the quotes
from Patricia Estrada needs to
be clarified. She said: “Wo-
men who are on welfare are
forced to go to clinics where
the personnel try to convince
them to use birth control
methods to limit the size of
their families. This is simply

preparing the Chicana for
forced sterilization.”

First, I question whether
Ms. Estrada is referring to the
situation in Colorado, or
somewhere else in the coun-
try. If she is describing
incidents in Colorado, she
should back her statements
up with specific examples.
Where are welfare staff per-
sons forcing women to go to
clinics for birth control? At
what clinic are personnel
trying to persuade women to
limit the size of their families?

Because I work in family
planning, I’m concerned about
these accusations. My experi-
ence has been that family
planning personnel go out of
their way not to tell patients
how many children they
should have. I think the
emphasis goes toward helping a woman decide when she
wants children, rather than
the number she should have.

If women are being bull-
dozed into unhappy choices,
then let’s find out who is
applying the pressure. Unless
women take the responsibility
to specifically point out and
change these practices, other
sisters will continue to have
their heads and their lives
messed with.

Sincerely,
Sherilyn Brandenstein

Oops....

In our Aug. issue on rape we
reprinted an article by Susan
Griffin entitled “Rape-The All
American Crime.” Somehow
we misspelled her name and
we want to sincerely apolo-
gize to Ms. Griffin for this
egregious error.

Dear Big Mama Rag:

I may never find as many
women who people my heart
quite the same as you “Big
Mama’s” do. From start until
now, BMR has been in part my
recreation, in part my crea-
tion, and it has created a part
of me. Many women have
thanked me for the work I've
done on the paper. But I don’t
remember now if I ever took
the time to say thank you
back. So now, with those
crazy tears from the concert
returning to my eyes, thank
you! Thanks for being and by
being, giving me a chance to
be a part of you.

Love,
Elissa Meyer

Inmate Talks Candidly About Prison Life

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Earlier this summer, I visited Colorado Women’s Correctional
Institution in Canon City and interviewed Ronelle Lee, an inmate
at CWCI. Most of the women there are serving time for relatively
“light” crimes (dealing with dope, prostitution, passing bad
checks, etc.). In some cases, they were engaging in illegal
activities in order to survive and keep their families going. Ronelle
gave us the following descriptions of her experiences in prison.

Zak Rombakis

BMR: Could you talk about
what happens when you first
came here to CWCI?

RL: Okay. When you come
into the prison, you have to
stay in isolation for two
weeks. This is where they're
supposed to run all their tests
on you. They run a physical
exam and they find out what
you're allergic to. They find
out if you're a dope addict.
There’s a whole battery of
tests they run on you. Like the
CAT to see what your grade
level is.

When I got to the prison,
driving up there, you say,
“Hey, this is a beautiful

building.” You think you can
do the time in a nice place.
You sit up there in the control
room and wait for the officer
to come down. Here comes
someone in a white uniform
taking all your personal things
from you.

BMR: Who brought you here?

RL: The Denver
Sheriff's Department, two men.
No women guard at all.

So next I went to the isolation
or hospital. Well, when I first
went out the door, she told
me, “Don’t look around. Look
straight ahead or keep your
eyes down.” In other words,
don’t look at the people that’s
already in here. I will see them
when I get out of isolation.
Cause one girl that was there I
knew on the streets. And then
I found that there were a lot of
them I knew on the streets.
You go in the isolation
ward...you know, you don’t
know what to do anyway.

They take me downstairs and
say, “Pull off all your
clothes.” So I start pulling
them all off and they put me
on the table. Ran their fingers
all up in my butt and stuff to
see if I brought anything in.
Then they spray you...bug
spray. Wherever you have
hair, that’s where they spray
you. And it stinks.

Okay. After they sprayed me
and gave me a towel to dry off
with and gave me a pair of
pajamas to put on (no shoes
to put on), I got a shower.
Then they gave me ten
cigarettes. I was in a room in
the Lower South for Thursday.
Then on Friday they took me
out of there and took me to
the hospital for a physical
examination from the so-
called doctor. He’s had a heart
attack and he’s still a doctor.
This girl who was down there
in isolation has a number
that’s almost like mine. My
last number is 7 and hers is 6.
So I'm giving him all my
information to go in my chart
and he fools around and
writes it on her chart. ‘Okay.
He took my blood and put her
name on it. I stayed in
isolation for one month
because of that. They had to
keep repeating the blood test
because they kept saying that
something was coming up in
the blood. Then I said, “Are
you sure that you have the
right name from the blood you
took in the beginning?” They
said yes. I said, “You must
not, because the blood that
has all this in it isn’t none of
mine.” Later they found out
that this girl was really sick.

Women's Prison in Canon
City Sued by Inmates

Carol Lease

Late last spring a civil
action was filed in the United
States District Court against
the Warden of the Colorado
State Penitentiary, the Asso-
ciate Warden of the Colorado
Women’s Correctional Insti-
tution (CWIC), the Director of
the Department of Institu-
tions, the Chief of Corrections
for the State, the Parole Board
and the Physician for the
Colorado State Penitentiary,
on behalf of all women who
have been confined at CWIC,
are presently being confined
there, or who will be confined
there while the suit is pending
in court.

Among the violations to the
Constitution stated in the
complaint are that “the
conditions existing at CWIC,
from the physical arrange-
ment of the prison to the
degrading treatment of pri-
soners by the personnel,
subject (the women inmates)
to unequal and inferior treat-
ment on the basis of their sex,
violates their rights to equal
protection and in the totality
of the circumstances consti-
tutes cruel and unusual
punishment, all in violation of
the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Consti-
tution;

that women prisoners have
been deprived of their rights
to free speech, to free press,
their right to political associ-
ation and religious freedom
guaranteed by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution;

that inmates at CWIC have
been denied due process of
the law by being punished and
penalized for violation of
unwritten rules in an “arbitrary
and capricious manner;”

that the actions of the
wardens have violated the
Equal Rights Amendment of
the Colorado Constitution.

The complaint also cites
denial of access to the Courts
and to judicial process in
violation of habeas corpus and
due process as guaranteed by
the Fifth, Sixth and Four-
teenth Amendments to the
Constitution.

Class Action

This class action suit began
when husbands and wives
who were both confined to the
Colorado State Penitentiary
visited each other and com-
pared notes on their treat-

ment. It soon became obvious
that the women prisoners did
not have the same opportuni-
ties that the men did and were
treated more like children than
adults. One male prisoner was
a jailhouse lawyer and the
legal action was initiated, on
behalf of the women inmates.
Although there is an extensive
law library at the men’s
maximum facility, the initia-
tors realized that they needed
help from people outside the
prison walls. Help came from
the National Lawyer's Guild

and the Law Collective in
Denver. Later the court ap-
pointed Frances Olsen as the
attorney.

The Law Collective is
currently compiling affidavits
from women inmates and has
sent sets of “extensive”
questions to the Warden Alex
Wilson and Associate Warden
May Gillespie. “They are
required to answer all ques-
tions," according to Joan
Tempko of the Law Collective.
“If the answers given aren't
sufficient we will resubmit
them. They have to answer all
our questions whether they
are admissible in court or not.
If they don’t cooperate we can
get a court order and then if
they don’t they'll be in
contempt. But I don’t think
that will have to be done.”

After this stage is com-
plete, any person concerned
in the case can be deposed in
front of a court reporter or a
tape recorder. “We'll probably
talk to Ms. Gillespie a couple
of days,” and others too says
Ms. Tempko. “The whole
thing could take a year...Up to
a year ago there was no
contact like this with CWIC.
Then the Minority Women’s
Caucus and the University
Without Walls Teacher Corps
Program and the lawsuit all
became involved with the
women’s prison.”

According to Ms. Gillespie
the lawsuit is a “fad...we’re

And they were giving me all
these nerve pills which really
freaked me out. I would take it
in the morning and an hour
later I'm knocked out. That
was four times a day. So
finally I took myself off of it,
because I don't take nerve
pills as it is and I didn't want
any.

There I am walking around,
not knowing anything. I was
really spaced out, so they
bring all these tests for me to
take. I'm sitting up there just
marking anything down. My
mind couldn't function with
what I was doing. There are
500 questions on it. Ques-
tions like, “Do you like tall
women?”, “Who do you like
best out of your family?” or
“Do you lie very much?”
During the whole time I was
taking the test I'd just go
down the NO column and
draw a straight line.

When I took the CAT
test...now I have a high
school education and I've
been to college...then they go
telling me I can’t function in
the institution on showing
people how to do things
because I’m not qualified to
do it. The reason they say this
is because of the fact that
they don’t actually know what
a person can do and what she

After being locked up in
isolation, you have to go talk
to the warden. This is how the
interview goes with the
warden:

“I am the Warden here. My
name is Miss Gillespie. This

Prisoner

“Lord, help me this day to
learn to keep my big mouth
shut.” The plaques were
round and multi-colored and
also the very first things we
saw upon entering the Canon
City Correctional Institute for
Women. They had been
hand-made by the women
prisoners, who it would seem
from our visit, had learned the
lesson well. After all they had
to survive in this system while
doing their time and it was
obvious that keeping their
mouths shut was about the
best way to accomplish this
survival.

One thing must be made
perfectly clear at the outset:
all women, living as we are in
the patriarchal world—one run
by, on, and for the interests of
the other half of the species—
are living in a kind of prison.
The prison institutions, them-
selves, however—the way they
are run and the way women
inside are treated—are a
glaring example in miniature
of all women’s status under
the patriarchy and capitalism.
Women’s prisons confirm, in
concrete, how the male-dom-
inated world views all women
in general.

This confirmation takes on
a variety of forms and sexism
and capitalism are at the root
of most of them: how women
are treated differently within
the courts and the flaws, the
kinds of crimes women
commit and for what purpos-
es, the way women are
controlled and indoctrinated
with “typical feminine” attri-
butes while in prison, the
kinds of “vocations” taught in
prison and the sparsity of
education and employment
programs for prisoners and
ex-cons.

Because of our economic
system, which is capitalism,
it is generally true that the
prison population of both
sexes is composed mostly of
the poor. Although studies
have told us that the average
urban resident commits ten
felonies a year, each punisha-
ble theoretically by a year or
more imprisonment, the ma-
jority of these people will
never see the inside of a
prison (not to mention our
ex-president). The people who
do not have access to money
and know-how are usually the
first to be incarcerated.

In a survey on court and
correctional services for wo-
men, the American Associa-
tion of University Women
found that 80% of the women
surveyed were unemployed
when they were arrested and
also that Blacks and Chicanas
were arrested more frequently
than Anglo women in com-
parison to their respective
ethnic communities.

Nevertheless, other than
being non-white and poor, the
similarities between women

Society tries to imprison all women and is generally
successful in doing so through its imposition of the
social-cultural-psychological-political-economic bars around us.
Some of us are less privileged than others and are often sucked
into penal institutions to do “time.”

A society sets up its own standards for crime and creates its
own conditions to encourage crime. So the criminal will inevitably
exist. And the treatment of a woman who commits a criminal act
in a patriarchy will be an exaggeration of her usual treatment in
the society. She is treated as a child, given no responsibility for
her life.

At the Denver County jail women who are either awaiting
trial or serving time have to or are encouraged to sew uniforms for
the men’s section of the jail. Women have to work or their
privileges are taken away from them, and they are not given “good
time” that will shorten their sentences. The men do not have to
work because there simply isn’t enough work for them. So why
can’t the men sew their own clothes?

At the Colorado Women’s Correctional Institution at Canon
City women sew shirts for other state institutions. The prison as a
source of cheap labor is a self-perpetuating system.

It seems that the ultimate idea behind the lawsuit against
the women’s prison is not exactly to provide women with the same
opportunities that the men have, but to stimulate serious
attention, research, and thought about the position of women in
the penal system. There are, however, individual changes that can
be accomplished to alleviate inequitable situations and Rudy San
Fellipo, the Director of the Department of Institutions, sees such
“administrative changes” as possible solutions to some
problems.

The prison psychiatrist at Canon City refers to women as
“junkie bitches.” The warden of the women’s facility refers to the
inmates as “my girls” as if she were running a finishing school.
She readily admits that a woman who has been institutionalized
for over two years will be harmed by being in the institution any
longer. But up to that time she feels that the “structured program
with a busy schedule with lots of things to do” is effective.

Indeterminate sentencing that is prevalent in courts today
places the decision for release on the prison officials and the
parole board. This gives tremendous indiscriminate power over
people’s lives to state officials who basically believe that as long
as there have to be institutions “we're proud of the ones we have.”

This penal system perpetuates itself. It will not make
decisions that would seriously jeopardize its existence. So any
impetus for real community corrections as an alternative to
isolated, alienating imprisonment that offers no rehabilitation and
is dehumanizing and alienating will have to come from individual
groups or a coalition of groups that are committed to prison
reform.

Women’s prisons are the ultimate oppression in a
patriarchy. The majority of women who are confined there are
guilty of victimless crimes, bad check writing and drug-related
offenses. They got caught while using survival tactics that many
women find necessary to exist in a society where women have little
power and are economically dependent on men.

Community corrections half-way houses must be
established in Denver and other communities for women to
“serve” time in. Then the prison could be turned into a museum so
the guards would have something to do. - C.L.

Out of Prison, Female
and Unemployed

Carolyn Agosta -

You’re a woman...there’s
strike one against you...you
have just been released from
Canon City on a charge of
conspiracy to commit a
burglary. While in Canon City,
you were taught to sew, wash
dishes and file. Now what?
Where does a woman turn for
help - finding a job, or
receiving training, finding a
place to live and food to eat,
clothes to wear and still keep
herself out of prison while not
having to resort to the old
habits that got her arrested
and sentenced to Canon City
in the first place? After speaking
with both private and com-
munity agencies that are
involved with ex-convicts, I
realized that a woman, just
out of prison and looking for a
job has little, if any help
available for her.

There are approximately 60
women and 1,250 men incar-
cerated in Canon City at the
present time. According to
Roger Lauen of the Teacher
Corps Program, “Women
should not be incarcerated for
the types of offenses typically
committed by women.” But
women are jailed and how
they are dealt with as convicts
and ex-convicts will...either
“make” them or “break” them
as self-respecting and self-
willed human beings.

In the prisons today, very
little is being offered to a
woman as hope for the future.
Once she is released there is
no more hope than when she
was in prison. Every person
that this writer spoke to
admitted that the conditions
in prison were worse for
women than men and that her
opportunities for any form of
rehabilitation were far less
than for men.

Discrimination

Sandy Carruthers of Better
Jobs for Women reports that
their agency is in the
“exploring stages” working
with other programs to dis-
cover what is already available
for women and what is the
“most viable plug-in” for their
agency. She states that she
hopes to have a referral
system set up by this fall.

Employ-Ex, which receives
funding from LEAA (Law
Enforcement Assistance Ad-
ministration) can only deal
with “high-impact” crimes,
which are burglary, robbery,
assault and rape. Only 1% of
all women imprisoned qualify
for help from this federally
funded program. George Ben-
ningfield, assistant director of
Employ-Ex, stated, “It is a
built-in discriminatory prac-
tice, since very few women
commit these types of
crimes.” He further reports
that since December of 1972
less than 10% of the convicts
they have assisted have been
women. The program is
supposed to help ex-convicts
to “become self-reliant.” They
are taught to “fill out
applications,” they receive
four hours of intensive coun-
seling to get them ready for
job interviews. They also
receive food, clothing, and
tools for a job and bus tokens.
There is no counseling to help
the ex-convict readjust to
family life and to the
community.

The Pinto Project, accord-
ing to Chuck Padilla, is just
beginning to take steps
toward assisting women who
have been in prison. They
have just met with a “major
business” to have them hire at
least two women who had
been in prison. Mr. Padilla
stated that it is “more difficult
to place women than men”
and to “combat the stigma of
her having been in prison.”
Their program concentrates
on what they feel are the three
major needs of a person just
out of prison: education,
employment and counseling.
Padilla also said that he felt
their program was “not highly
geared to help women” at this
time. But by October they will
have the funds to hire a
woman, preferably an ex-con-
vict to work with women in
prison. He further stated that
presently they “focus (their)
main attention on men, but
must gear it to women.”

The organization began at a
“Council of Unity” in January,
1971. People behind the
prison walls contacted Chi-
cana organizations asking for
their help so that they (the
inmates) could help them-
selves.

A staff of 17 was involved
with the program at the
beginning, but a drastic cut in
funds left barely enough for a
skeletal staff of 5. At the end
of October the Department of
Labor will be able to see its
way to funding the program
$292,000. Mr. Padilla says
that he has high hopes to then
develop the staff to its fullest
to meet the needs of both
women and men.

Vicki Romero of the Com-
mission on Community Rela-
tions had much to say
regarding women in prison:
“When she gets out, there is
not too much available to
her...women have it unusually
bad...there is no one to help
them.” One important point
that she brought was the
concern that women in prison
have for their children. An
agency that Ms. Romero
works with, Las Valentinas
(literally, the brave ones) tries
to help women by contacting
their families and children and
taking messages back to the
women, lessening some of
the pain and apprehension.

Her job with the commis-
sion allows Ms. Romero to
work with various groups such
as Las Valentinas, Minority
Women’s Caucus, Colorado
Caucus of Black Women and
Cooperative Endeavor #4 to
help identify community
needs the greatest of which is
penal reform.

College Program

There may be a small ray of
hope in the form of the
University Without Walls Na-
tional Teacher Corps. This is a
two-year program which has a
year to go. It involves 19
convicts and ex-convicts, only
two of whom are women due
to the ratio of men and women
in the penitentiary.

The women, one who is still
in Canon City and one who is
out on parole, have the
opportunity to earn a B.A. in
two years in non-traditional
working and teaching situa-
tions. The inmate is allowed
to leave the women’s facility
with minimal security once a
week for meetings; the
parolee lives in Denver and
checks in with the Teacher
Corps office to meet with
instructors. According to
Roger Lauen, the director of
the project, the program is
quite effective. There has not
been one drop-out. One
aspect of the program utilizes
the students as community
workers and crisis interveners
in assisting people with
problems. It is estimated that
over 2,000 people have been
aided through this aspect of
the program.

Some of the people at the
Teacher Corps have hopes
for an alternative to incarcera-
tion, that is a community
corrections program. This
would be a place where a
convicted person would sleep,
eat, and receive on-the-job
training and counseling. A
program to meet her total
needs from within the com-
munity.

Mobilizes

Shecat

The Lesbian Task Force of  
NOW is alive, well, and  
growing newly-formed chapters state-  
wide. While Lesbians have  
always been a vital part of the  
women’s movement, our unique  
problems have not been  
dealt with on any large scale  
and our needs have not been  
articulated or acted upon in a  
positive manner. The purpose  
of the Lesbian Task Force,  
therefore, is to attack on all  
fronts the issues oppressing  
us as Lesbians.

Uplifted by the recent surge  
of energy in the Feminist  
unity; I decided to  
attend the first meeting of the  
newly-formed Task Force. I  
went out of a desire to find an  
appropriate way to channel  
energy into a forceful group. I  
definitely liked the sound of  
the words, “Task Force”  
--serious, positive, and po-  
tentially powerful.

I was far from disappointed.  
From among the 15 or so in  
attendance, I saw experience  
and inexperience, zealous-  
ness and caution, open  
activism, and the shyness of  
still being in the closet, but  
every woman there was there  
because she wanted to do  
something. We talked about a  
broad range of subjects that  
included legislation, educa-  
tion, politics, logistics, and  
tactics.

Right now, most of our  
energy is concentrated on  
gathering statewide support  
for a sweeping gay anti-dis-  
crimination package for the  
state legislature, and we have  
people working diligently  
contacting legislators, insti-  
tutions, every kind of contact  
it is possible to make, doing  
crash education where needed  
(which is almost everywhere).  
We also are gathering docu-  
mentation of discrimination  
for those liberal (and other)  
fools who keep saying “Show  
us a gay complaint.”

Other fronts of attack are to  
gain full Lesbian representa-  
tion on various commissions,  
such as the Commission on  
Community Relations and the  
Commission on the Status of  
Women. We have people  
pressuring religious, educa-  
tional, financial, and political  
institutions; some sisters are  
writing and developing edu-  
cational portfolios; some are  
working toward ending dis-  
crimination and harassment  
of Lesbians in prison; some  
are starting to coordinate a  
mail-order type of book  
service.

We are also supporting  
other Lesbian Task Forces in  
the state, as we are painfully  
aware that any significant  
changes in this state will have  
to come from all the outlying  
conservative areas and not  
just Denver alone.

Another issue in the Task  
Force is the importance of  
class consciousness. Clas-  
sism and elitism are issues  
that have not been dealt with  
satisfactorily in the women’s  
movement, and working class  
sisters are encouraged to  
express their anger in the  
hope that we will not in any  
way oppress each other by  
leftover attitudes from a sick  
society that has failed to  
achieve dignity and freedom  
for all.

Women in the Task Force  
have spontaneously formed  
special interest groups as  
they are needed. This process  
is remarkable to me, since I  
have seen many groups, even  
women’s groups, where the  
leadership is forced to accept  
the burden of responsibility.  
In the Task Force, it’s like we  
all are leaders, in a way. It’s  
more the fact of us all working  
together in harmony in a  
process of collective evolu-  
tion, rather than following any  
traditional form of getting  
things done. Every woman is  
given the dignity of leadership  
that otherwise would fall to  
just a few. Our energy has  
become synergistic, so that  
we grow as individuals at the  
same rate the groups grow.  
One of the best things that  
happens at our meetings as a  
result of our process, is that  
whenever we hit an issue we  
can’t agree on, a “brainstorm-  
ing effect” occurs, and we  
usually come up with some  
surprising alternative satis-  
factory to everyone and that  
no one individual would have  
thought of it alone.

Some of our dreams, I  
discovered, were far too  
utopian to be considered as  
current projects, like my own  
hope of creating a woman’s  
center large enough in scope  
to provide a place where  
women could go to learn  
everything they are denied in  
our present culture. This kind  
of dream is an evolutionary  
one, and we decided in terms  
of practicality alone that for  
the present, we have to begin  
by an all-out attack on those  
elements of our society that  
most refuse to accept our  
existence. Only then will we  
be more free to build our  
dreams in peace.

In any case, I am enthusi-  
astic about the Lesbian Task  
Force and proud of what is  
happening as a result of our  
energy. Somehow I always  
knew that women’s love would  
be a conquering force, for-  
midable in the eyes of  
opposition. It is incredibly  
beautiful to see it working.

KOA-TV Agreement

Signed

Chocolate Waters

An agreement has finally  
been reached with KOA-TV  
and Radio concerning the  
station’s programming and  
personnel policies in regards  
to women and minorities. The  
agreement was signed on July  
31 between the station and  
four groups (NOW, Mass  
Media Task Force, Sundiate,  
Inc. and the Co. Com. on the  
Mass Media and the Spanish  
surnamed).

According to Virginia  
Woodard, a representative of  
the Mass Media Task Force,  
there will now be 12 specials  
per year on minorities and  
women. Two of these will be  
devoted to women, one to  
Native Americans, three to  
Blacks, and six to Chicanas.  
(The reason that there will be  
more specials about Chicanas  
is that KOA did not meet the  
standards of a pact signed in  
1971 regarding Chicana is-  
sues). There will also be more  
air space devoted to public  
service announcements about  
women and minorities.

Towards the end of the  
negotiations with KOA Ms.  
Woodard said that there was a  
split among the coalition  
membership concerning con-  
sultancy fees. (KOA will have  
a nine-member panel consist-  
ing of women and minorities  
who will make suggestions  
about programming). Both  
Channel 9 and 7 pay their  
consultants but KOA is  
offering instead a $2,000  
scholarship to an outstanding  
woman or minority. Ms.  
Woodard stated that “women  
and minorities have volun-  
teered their services for free  
for too long,” and added that  
“NOW has a very strong stand  
on volunteerism and will not  
back down on this issue.”

Ms. Woodard also urged  
people to continue to call and  
write KOA if they disagree  
with the station’s program-  
ming, or if interested in  
photography or writing for  
television concerning issues  
of interest to women and  
minorities should contact Ms.  
Woodard at 986-7430.

Proposal for CU Women’s Center In the Works

Jan Throndson

The “Women’s Crisis Center  
Project,” once a minor plan  
for a women’s rap-line, has  
mushroomed into a full-  
fledged proposal for initiation  
at the University of Colorado  
this fall.

Ideas for a self-defense  
program, a rap-line emphasiz-  
ing sexual assault and rape  
counseling, medical self-help  
programs, and legal counsel-  
ing are incorporated in the  
proposal.

Included in the plan to  
provide a central meeting  
place for university and  
community women, are a  
clearing house for women on  
other university campuses,  
officers for on-going women’s  
programs, a coffee house and  
consciousness-raising  
groups.

Linda Christopher, spokes-  
woman for the project, said  
that the proposal for the  
center has already been sub-  
mitted to the University Plan-  
ning Committee, “so maybe  
we can be allowed to move  
into a university house on  
1229 University.”

Even though the proposal  
has the approval of Roland  
Rautenstraus, acting Univer-  
sity president, she said that  
the Planning Committee is  
having a problem  
defining the project to fit its  
housing guidelines.

“Our proposal doesn’t ex-  
actly fit their housing guide-  
lines,” Christopher said,  
“We're bringing together a  
bunch of different activity  
groups under one center. . .  
we're not just one interest  
area like East Asian Studies.”

Presently, there are two  
other women’s centers in  
Boulder--the CU Women's  
Center and the Boulder  
County Women’s Resource  
Center.

“The University Women's  
Center is more academically  
oriented and provides career  
counseling for women, but  
the city Women’s Center is  
actually just getting started,”  
Christopher said.

Although the Boulder  
County Women's Resource  
Center is still undecided  
about the format of their  
program, they are tentatively  
considering such interest  
areas as: employment train-  
ing, child care assistance,  
peer counseling, cooperative  
money-making projects and  
various other plans for wo-  
men.

Lesbian Mothers Defense Fund Formed

“A Lesbian mother, as other  
mothers who are raising  
children alone, faces an  
enormous daily struggle try-  
ing to make ends meet.  
Obviously, when a legal court  
battle ensues, there is often  
no money to hire a competent  
attorney; there is more often  
no attorney who will take the  
case without personal bias,  
and this coupled with an  
all-over hostile judiciary sys-  
tem lends to the terror all  
Lesbian mothers face when  
the threat of losing their  
children becomes a real live  
nightmare.”

Out of this need the Lesbian  
Mothers National Defense  
Fund has been born. This  
fund would give help with  
court costs, child care, food,  
clothing, attorney’s fees, etc.  
It would ensure Lesbian  
mothers from all over the  
country a fair representation  
in court. It would also make  
possible the printing and  
distribution of guidelines,  
previous court cases and even  
make available films now  
being used in court.

In cases pending in ex-  
tremely hostile territory, the  
defense fund would provide a  
competent and sympathetic  
attorney with transportation  
from one state to another.

If you would like to become  
a member of this organization  
send $2.00 (less or more as  
your budget permits) to:  

Lesbian Mothers National  
Defense Fund, 1941 Division,  
Enumclaw, Washington,  
98002.

Of the other university  
women-oriented activities,  
Christopher said Birth Con-  
trol, Women Studies, Women  
Athletics and Day Care —  
Kiddie Kampus -- would  
hopefully be housed in the  
Women’s Crisis Center.

“Maybe a women’s center is  
the answer to getting things  
done together. . .the answer  
to better communication,”  
said Christopher who is  
jointly working with Nancy  
Polatti of the Boulder Com-  
munity Free School and Suzy  
Wiggins of the University  
Rap-line.

Christopher also stated that  
the group would like to run  
classes at the Women’s Crisis  
Center through such pro-  
grams as Women Studies,  
Experimental Studies and the  
Free School. “We would like  
to be able to pay our  
instructors though, and in  
order to do that, we'll have to  
ask for private contributions.

Two Women Kill Rapist, Edgewater, Fla. -- Two Indiana coeds
apparently strangled an assailant after he raped them and then
tried to kill them with an icepick, police said. Investigators said it
was believed the two women were hitchhiking when the
26-year-old man picked them up and drove them to a wooded area.
Deputies said the women had managed to choke the man with a
scarf and believing he was only stunned, had run to a farmhouse
and called authorities. When deputies arrived, they found him
dead. (Excerpted from the L.A. Times, 6/9/74)

Flagyl May Cause Cancer -- Three separate experiments have
revealed that Flagyl (a drug used in the treatment of Trichomonas
- see Women and Health column) has caused cancer in mice and
rats. The Health Research Group has petitioned the Food and
Drug Administration to ban the drug but the FDA has offered little
response. Your doctor may not be aware of the findings about
Flagyl so you need to tell her/him that you do not want to take the
drug.

History

MARIA MITCHELL, ASTRONOMER

Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818 on Nantucket
Island. By the age of 13 she was assisting her father in his work in
astronomy. As she grew older, she became the librarian for the
Nantucket Athenæum and spent her evenings watching the skies.

In October of 1847, she discovered a telescopic comet
which bears her name, and a year later, became the first woman
elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1850,
by unanimous vote, Mitchell was elected to the Association for the
Advancement of Science, again the first woman.

While Maria Mitchell had an unusually easy time
establishing herself in the field of astronomy, she did not forget
the oppression of other women. She worked both for the suffrage
movement and as president of the Association for the
Advancement of Women. While she was the first professor of
astronomy from 1865-88, at the newly founded Vassar College,
she criticized the male president and board of trustees for
employment practices such as hiring men for the highest
positions and giving women unequal salaries.

Believing that women had much to contribute to the
progress of society, Mitchell once said: “I wish we could give
every woman who has a novel theory dear to her soul for the
improvement of the world, a chance to work out her theory in real
life.” (reprinted from Uppity Women! A Legacy of Liberation.)

Thoughts from Diane DiPrima

Diane DiPrima, who recently read her poetry in Denver at the
Changing Scene, is a woman who has achieved much success in
recent years as a poet and writer. She has produced four plays on
Broadway as well as a number of books including Memoirs of a
Beatnik, Revolutionary Letters, etc. DiPrima has been conducting
poetry workshops around the country as part of the Poetry In
Schools program and she recently helped teach a course entitled
Spiritual Poetics at the NAROPA Institute in Boulder. Having
grown up in NYC in an Italian neighborhood in the 50s, DiPrima
has often been identified with poets from the beat period such as
Allen Ginsberg. Presently living in northern CA, where she is
editing her unpublished writing and a book of essays entitled
Blessed Are The Meek, Baby, DiPrima is married and the mother of
five children. The following thoughts are taken from an interview
conducted by Marian DeVito and Ronnie Burk and we would like to
extend our appreciation to the Boulder Gay Record for supplying

ON FEMINISM: Feminism for
me is kind of funny because I
grew up thinking women were
superior to men, that’s a
terrible chauvinism I hate. I
grew up where women took
care of all the business and
men were pretty, lovely...sex
objects in a lot of ways...When
it got right down to getting
food on the table, raising the
children, making sure you
didn’t get evicted -- whatever -- it
was the women who took care
of the business. So I always
grew up assuming that it was
my business, that I would
handle it -- essentially. So it’s
been very recently that I’ve
started to share, to live with
men on equal..., almost equal
footing. I never even tried until
I had my first baby. All I
wanted was a baby, my baby,
but I didn’t want a man. Later
when I was in love, it wasn't a
kind of secretive relating
on a day-to-day level. So, like
Feminism was where I came
from.

COLLEGE DAYS: I went
straight from college to a
gay bar cause it was the only
safe place I knew in the city. It
was a place called the Swing
Rendezvous - 1953 - totally
peopled by very fierce street
dykes and a few mafia people
who ran the place and hung
out in the back. Both the
dykes and the mafia people
were very fond of me and my
friend Joannie. I left college
because I was in love with a
woman. Her name was Mari-
anne, a woman in my class.
We were both 17. She was in
love with my friend Joannie...
a typical adolescent situation.
I left college to live
together. Various things be-
gan to happen. Mother moved
in, the cops moved in,
Marianne was forced back to
school and I wasn’t forced to
do anything..., though my
parents were very conserva-
tive. Like, up until I went to
college, I wasn't allowed to go
to the opera in New York City
on a Saturday night. Once
they grasped they couldn’t do
anything, they didn’t stand in
the way. Their conservatism
was overrun by their basic
kindness and affection.

My father’s talk on homo-
sexuality was something like
this, “I've been reading up on
this subject and through my
reading I have found that the
main problem with these
people is their parents won't
accept them. Well, you’re not
going to have that problem
here. I don't want you to feel
that way.” From 18 until about
21, the atmosphere that
nurtured and protected me
was a gay one. The scenes
that I got into were very few
because I was very wary of the
amount of violence going on.
It was very full of knives and
bullets. The situation was one
with poor people; lots of
ghetto violence. I avoided
getting into many scenes with
the women that I met at bars,
but I did get very close to a lot
of them...

It was like home, a very safe
atmosphere. We were mutual-
ly taken care of by the scene.
Our scene was relatively jail
ridden. We would get money
to bail people out and they
would protect us from the
streets in general. The mad-
ness! Like, we were sleeping

say Big Mama Rag for 10% off

in hallways. The same scene
that went on in the mid 60s
except there were very few of
us. Later, I wanted a child, but
really didn’t especially want a
man. About a year after she
was born I fell in love with a
woman painter. Her name was
Evelyn McDaniels. She was
from Texas. It was a totally
stormy and very opening year.
It was the first time I took
peyote - 1959 - New York City.
She lived in a studio on Ave.
C, and I lived off Ave. B, an
incredible slum.

ON INVOLVEMENT: However, now I find myself very
scared to get back into a gay
scene. That's a funny thing to
say. It’s not very often I find
myself scared of things. But
I've found the degree of
involvement that I get with a
woman is so total, it meshes
on every particular level so
completely, that it doesn’t
leave any room to work. I can
really empathize with what a
woman is feeling. I can’t do
that with a man, which is just
as well. We can keep a little
space between us.

ABOUT CHILDREN: There are
different planes of history
going on in America right now
that don’t even communicate
at all. If one talks of official
political America, where is
that? Even when Rome began
to fall, it took 500 years to
finish it off. I can't wait that
long! The possibilities that
children have doesn’t seem to
have much to do with the
political or social structure of
America. I keep kids out of
school as much as I can. They
have their own theatre, draw,
paint, write, whatever, it’s up
to them. Instead of keeping
their fantasies locked up, the
way we used to do, they just
live them.

I can help them get the
space to do that. They’ve got to
figure out how to put it
together. I’ve found they can
pretty well figure out for
themselves. I try to run a
policy of non-interference in
my children’s work. It’s not
like allowing them to do
whatever they want to do...it’s
pretty much believing them
and backing them up. It works
out rather strange at
times...for instance, “You
don’t want to go to school
today, do you? It’s raining.”
They're the ones that assume
the responsibility, they
decide. “Well, I owe so and so
so many pages of Math, I need
to go.” It’s a great thing to
take on themselves at age
10—the responsibilities, to
develop those muscles, to
decide their lives.

ON SEXUALITY: There is
something about the homo-
sexual—in a lot of ways—is
a lot closer to being a whole
person. Bisexuality is really
groovy. The things society
makes you feel more and more
less whole. When you see the
old men, the old Indian men,
they are as feminine as
masculine. The same holds
true for the women, it’s a
different form of femininity. In
order to be a person with
power, a shaman, they have
totally amalgamated both
sexes. Basically, that’s what
the world’s been doing, that’s
what's happening, that’s our
trip. I used to always envy
snails. Know how snails
copulate? They have female
organs on one side and male
organs on the other and they
get together both ways. I think
- try being a snail in my next
life.

Feminist School Ideas Come Together

Jackie Bryson

In late July five women were  
invited to discuss the idea of a  
Feminist school for children—to share what they know  
about education and about  
Feminism and to try to  
develop some of the principles  
by which a Feminist  
school would operate. The  
following article was taken  
from that discussion.  
BONNIE TRUMBULE - Director  
of Sebastian House, an  
alternative learning resource  
for people 12-18; Associate  
Producer of Anatomy of  
Women TV series; Mother of  
two young people, a daughter  
age 11 and a son age 14;  
Community organizer in Phil-  
adelphia Education Project;  
Former member of WITCH  
(Women’s International Ter-  
rorist Conspiracy from Hell).  
MARY BACKIEL - Spent two  
years teaching in the Open  
Living School in Evergreen,  
which is an alternative pro-  
gram within the Jefferson  
County Public School Sys-  
tem; Formerly a member of  
the Denver Women’s Theater  
Group.

YVONNE STITH - Teacher for  
two years at Lucy Stone  
Cooperative, an alternative  
Feminist-initiated day care  
project and is currently  
writing a book about that  
experience; Mother of two  
boys (ages 4 and 5); Original  
organizer of the Women’s  
Broadcasting Corporation;  
Has compiled a non-sexist  
educational program for pre-  
schoolers; Presently is em-  
ployed by Mountain Bell as a  
telephone installer.

LINDA FOWLER - Coordinator  
of Big Mama Rag; Linda has a  
daughter age 8, who has been  
enrolled for two years in  
Strawberry Fields, an alterna-  
tive elementary school in  
Denver; Was ADC (Aid to  
Dependent Children) Repre-  
sentative to the Advisory  
Board of Gilpin County Dept.  
of Welfare; Linda is a  
mountain woman who resides  
part-time in her self-constructed  
cabin in the mountains  
above Idaho Springs.  
JACKIE BRYSON - Former  
public school and Catholic  
school teacher in New York  
City; has two children, a son,  
5 and a daughter 3; was an  
active parent member of the  
Lucy Stone Coop for two  
years; Coordinator of Big  
Mama Rag and plans to attend  
DU Law School in September.

Jackie: We were trying to  
define some ideas for discus-  
sion tonight... some goals  
for a Feminist school. Or why  
a Feminist school, anyway?  
One of the most glaring needs  
seems to be that in public or  
alternative schools, while  
sexism may be a concern, the  
varying levels of conscious-  

ness about sexism make it  
difficult to be clear about what  
you might want in an ideal  
school. Usually, there’s either  
constant confrontation—or a  
lack of it—that leads to  
frustration. Feminists seem to  
be reacting to rather than  
building something concrete.  
Bonnie: Even in a Feminist  
school, you'd still be con-  
fronting sexism. For example,  
there is a prospective teacher  
volunteering at Sebastian  
House. He is interested in  
alternative education and has  
something to offer. However,  
he constantly calls women  
“chicks” even though both  
Jerry (my husband) and I have  

talked to him about it.  
Feminist values are not a part  
of his life, no matter what we  
say. He won't be hired  
because I don’t want that kind  
of attitude expressed around  
the young girls at Sebastian  
House.

Yvonne: Also, an example  
would be set for the boys at  
Sebastian House. It would  
more or less give them  
permission to be sexist. We  
need male teachers to be  
models for boys, too.  
Jackie: I would like a school  
for my children where we  
would be starting with high  
consciousness teachers, so  
we wouldn’t have to spend a  
lot of time educating teach-  
ers—raising their conscious-  
ness.

Yvonne: There are a lot of  
Feminists working in different  
schools in Denver, and trying  
to raise consciousness where  
they are. But a different  
atmosphere would be created  
where Feminist goals were  
goals of the school itself  
rather than of one or two  
individuals working in the  
school.

Linda: I want teachers who  
are not afraid of giving values  
to students. It’s nonsense to  
be afraid to do so for fear of  
“laying your trip” on a kid. If  
you don’t give children some  
concrete values to relate to,  
they'll just attach themselves  
to the general cultural values.  
Which is what we don’t want.  
Jackie: But how would a  
Feminist school be different  
from any other good school?  
Yvonne: Everything would be  
different. The social environ-  
ment, the materials, books,  
posters, everything. There  
would be an emphasis on  
changing sex roles. Carpentry  
for girls, for example. Sewing  
for boys.

Bonnie: No. It would be  
carpentry for people. Every-  
one would be invited.

Mary: And you'd have women  
teaching carpentry. Being  
models for both girls and  
boys.

Yvonne: What I’m talking  
about is that sometimes there  
is a need for separatism  
within a school—the boys  
from the girls. For example,  
I read an article about a  
Feminist in a day care center  
where the girls and boys were  
both encouraged to do car-  
pentry. But somehow the girls  
seemed to lack confidence  
when working with the boys.  
So the teacher initiated  
separate carpentry for the  
girls until they were confident  
and capable of working with  
the boys. A teacher would  
have to be sensitive to where  
kids were at and how to try to  
change things.

Mary: Yes. You would want to  
hire people with a conscious-  
ness that would allow them to  
do those things spontaneously.  

Bonnie: But when you come  
down to it, I don’t think that  
this kind of thing we’ve been  
describing really attacks the  
basic sexism that exists—that  
permeates the society.  
Jackie: I think we're still  
reacting to what’s around  
us—with no idea of where  
we'd go without something to  
react against. One of the ideas  
I've been thinking about  
lately, is that I would want a  
school which would encour-  
age those parts of the  
personality which are “femi-  
nine.” The feminine principle—  
creative, close to the earth,  
cooperative, expressive of  
feelings, protective, non-des-  
tructive.

Bonnie: I’d call that human-  
ism.

Linda: No. What we generally  
call “humanism” is really  
patriarchy. This culture has  
been created by men and I  
think we can speak in  
generalities about it. It is  
competitive, aggressive, ego-  
oriented. Women’s history  
has been so hidden from us  
that we confuse ourselves as  
women, with ourselves as  
members of the human race.  
When people speak of the  
human race, they usually are  
speaking of the history of  
patriarchy. We have to search  
back into our roots to find our  
real culture.

Bonnie: I don’t like that. It  
seems to say that women are  
inferior. That they haven't  
been able to take control,  
therefore, they’re incompe-  
tent.

Jackie: No. It says that  
women haven't had control of  
the violent forces of society.  
And they don't want that  
control. By saying that you  
want to bring out the  
masculine in women and the  
feminine in men, you bring up  
a very dangerous proposition.  
Women must protect and  
fertilize what woman is. Not  
deny or discount it.  
Yvonne: Maybe androgyny  
would be a good goal for a  
Feminist school.

Bonnie: I don’t know. I get  
confused about which came  
first. I recognize a feminine  
principle. But did it come  
from women per se? Or was it  
a result of our oppressed  
condition? And the tasks  
assigned to us?

Mary: I have thought about  
finding out what a women’s  
culture is. I have broad ideas  
of women’s qualities. We  
need to sort out why we are  
that way. More cooperative.  
More supportive. We have to  
be careful to understand all  
these things so as not to lay  
trips on boys or girls about  
what they should be.  
Bonnie: Really, it seems like  
we're talking about two  
different projects. One of  
them with kids—doing a  
school. The other is a project  
with the women involved in  
the school—to investigate  
those ideas.

Mary: We need to take  
specific examples of what we  
mean. Analyze them. It must  
be an ongoing “discovery  
process—how that would  
relate to teaching. But teach-  
ing can be so exhausting. Can  
the two things go on at the  
same time? You'd have to  
start your planning early and  
at the same time have a group  
of people who would watch  
the process of how teaching  
may change—distilling the  
philosophy and disbursing it.  
Yvonne: As a teacher, I’ve  
seen kids on all sorts of power  
trips—size, age, sex, race.  
I've also felt that few parents  
really want you to impose  
your values or have any  
opinions at all. But I think that  
politics and a school are not  
inimical. You share what's  
important to you with your  
students—a book, an idea.  
And if Feminism is an integral  
part of your life, your teaching  
would reflect that.

Jackie: I can think of a  
specific instance. Pre-schools  
more and more encourage  
kids to talk about their  
feelings. Mr. Rogers, on TV,  
for example. But that kind of  
talking seems to stop for boys  
at some age. It seems like it  
stops about the same time  
that sexual identity as a male  
begins. It would be a goal of a  
Feminist school for all kids,  
especially boys, to talk about  
their feelings.

Bonnie: Yes. You'd create an  
atmosphere of concern where  
kids can express their feelings.  
And you'd have to have a lot of  
faith that that atmosphere will  
work. Kids can give an  
incredible amount of support  
to one another, but that kind  
of relationship must be  
fostered by the school.  
Yvonne: And remember boys  
need heroes, too. Can we find  
some? For example, Henry  
Blackwell, when he married  
Lucy Stone, insisted that she  
not take his name, and he  
continued to publish her  
Feminist works for many  
years after her death. Or Chief  
Joseph and other Indians who  
have had their roots closer to  
the earth.

Mary: What about the ques-  
tion of male teachers? Where  
do you find men who believe  
in Feminism?

Jackie: Right. In hiring a  
teacher, I would want Femi-  
nist principles to be as  
important to that teacher as  
they are to me. I’ve never met  
a man who felt that way—who  
would call themselves Femi-  
nists and be proud of it. Very  
few if any, men understand  
the cultural implications of  
Feminism.

Linda: As I’ve been listening  
and discussing all this, I’ve  
come up with the conclusion  
that we may be talking about  
two different things and  
confusing them. There is such  
a thing as a non-sexist school  
and there is such a thing as a  
Feminist school. A Feminist  
school would explore the  
ideas of women, of women’s  
culture, women's values. It  
would consider the general  
culture to be a patriarchy, and  
start from that assumption.  
Bonnie: Then you'd be tipping  
the scale.

Linda: Yes. I think of tipping  
the scale back into the  
balance that patriarchy upset.

This article is also intended to be  
an organizing tool. Women  
interested in continuing this  
discussion or actually planning a  
Feminist school are urged to call  
the BMR office (322-2010). We'd  
be happy to coordinate.

advertise vb 1: INFORM, NOTIFY 2a: to announce publicly esp.
by printed notice...b: to call public attention to esp. by
emphasizing desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or
patronize.

Very simple, it would seem. And years ago it was. A simple
handbill or two, a barker in the market place extolling the virtues
of his wares. These were sufficient means to convey the supposed
worth of a product or service. But that was, indeed, years ago.

Today, advertising is a complex, major multi-billion dollar
industry in itself. And it has grown immeasurably in reach,
sophistication and subtlety. It utilizes virtually every known form
of printed and electronic media. From brochure to billboard. From
product label to company letterhead. From your car-radio to that
big 21” color tube in your living room. It is estimated that an
individual is bombarded by over 1,500 advertising messages, in
one form or another, each day. And so, because of its virtually
limitless reach, its relentless ability to pervade even the most
private aspects of our lives, advertising wields an enormous power
in this country today. A power which we, as women, would do
well to analyze, to understand, and when necessary, to challenge.

We can by no means put a blanket stamp of “evil” on all
advertising. It has been, and will continue to be, a provocative tool
for social and political change. It can also, however unwittingly,
be the prime instrument for the perpetuation of social and sexual
stereotypes.

In the months to come, this column will attempt to analyze
and/or bring to your attention those ads which specifically relate
to women in this manner. Particularly those in which the
stereotyping is most subtle. But for openers, let’s take a look at
one not too subtle example.

Moving That Tail

Continental Airlines had a problem. Some bright young soul
in the marketing department discovered that they were less well
known than the bus people over at Continental Trailways. In fact,
a marketing survey revealed that only about 10% of the flying
public knew about them, even though the airline boasts the best
on-time record and is acknowledged by its competitors to be the
best.

A further discovery: their five year old slogan, “the Proud
Bird with the Golden Tail”, was more well known than the
Continental name itself. Which was fine, if they could get a yellow
pages listing under “P” for “Proud Bird”. Which, of course, they
couldn't.

So, what to do? What to do? Somehow their advertising had
to generate quick name awareness and better associate that name
in the public’s mind with the best service.

Benton & Bowles, the ad agency, had a solution. You've
seen and heard it. Cheerful faces, stirring music, snappy lyrics.
And a rousing “At Continental Airlines, we really move our tail for
you!” Terrific! An absolute natural! Everything was there. Name
recognition, plus capitalization on a phrase that has traditionally
implied good service which, at the same time, cleverly
incorporated the already successfully established “tail” theme.

Unfortunately, some confusion arose as to just whose tail
was moving. Continental claims it meant to convey that it was the
symbolic Proud Bird's tail. The male flying public, given to its own
peculiar brand of symbolism, thought otherwise. The result: a lot
of CA stews who wished they were flying United’s “Friendly
Skies” instead...and an advertising campaign offensive to both
CA women and the female public alike.

A recent issue of New Times magazine reports that a union
official for the Steward and Stewardess Division of the Airline
Pilots Association “informed the airline that the slogan
represented ‘a movement back years in time... to a period when all
flight attendants were unfairly held out as sex objects.’ ”

No, no, protests Ms. Diane Levine, staff Vice President, CA
Public Relations. Smugly pointing out that the TV spots depict
both male and female employees, and that the outdoor advertising
features a stylization of their aircraft's famous “Golden Tail”, she
insisted to a group of Denver ad writers that the campaign was
conceived in utter innocence, with no intention of creating
suggestive innuendos. “The Continental Proud Tail is moving,
nobody else's. This is not to be construed any other way.”

Yet the New Times article further reveals: “To add insult to
injury—the company prepared a film to help stewardesses cope
with what it admitted might be one result of the ad campaign,
suggesting witty retorts to any provocative questions. For
example:

Passenger: ‘Will you move your tail for me?’

Stewardess: ‘Why, is it in the way?’ ”

Not to be construed any other way, huh? Oh come now,
Diane, really?

Postscript: The airline, already saddled with a record of
discrimination against women in the area of credit extension,
dismissed complaints by the union about the campaign as just
a lot of agitation by some “hard core women’s libbers”. They
charged that the women were using the issue as a grievance to
gain more leverage in contract negotiations. Leverage is needed, it
would seem. Recently, a California judge ruled in favor of a CA
stewardess who had filed a discrimination suit against the airline.
She had finally been fired, after having been suspended seven
times over the past year for being overweight...sometimes by as
much as half a pound.

Reader comments and contributions are encouraged.

offensive to women is to 1. Complain directly to the advertiser and

An Interview: with Cassie

Linda Fowler

Casse Culver is a

Lesbian/Feminist songwriter

and musician of superb talent
and unique presentation.

Based in Washington, D.C.,
Casse is currently on a U.S.
tour performing for small
gatherings as well as larger
Feminist groups. She was in
Denver August 1, sharing her
art with those who attended
the Big Mama Rag benefit at
the Oxford Hotel and again
the following night at St.
Barnabas Church.

Casse accompanies her
unforgettable voice with gui-
tar, autoharp, harmonica and
piano. She has written over
200 songs with several re-
corded by Maria Muldaur and
country singer Dickie Lee.

Casse’s songs reflect her
personal experiences with
oppression and with a male
dominated society. She feels
it is this oppression and her
own feelings of dissatisfaction,
anger and hurt that makes
her music so appealing: “Because women as a
class are oppressed, it makes
the music universal. That is
why it touches as many
women as it does.”

Being a Lesbian has, said
Casse, “both hurt me and
confined me in my experience
with the recording industry. I
received no encouragement
from society to be who I am.
Being a Lesbian was very
limiting: I draw much of my
material from that. But the
record industry sees only
pocketbooks, not human
needs. So they sat on my face
for 4 years. It was an
atmosphere that was non-
supportive, gave me no
encouragement and offered
only negative comments
about my music.”

In 1972 Casse cut a record
backed by Maria Muldaur and
the Full Tilt Boogie Band. It
was never released because
the recording company felt
the ‘musical climate was not
right’. These struggles “have
made me strong and clear-
sighted,” said Casse, “but
that does not erase the loss of
time and my anger about
that.”

be held equally, if not more, responsible for the quality of
advertising. They are, after all, the creators and originators of the
advertising which their client (the advertiser) may accept or reject.
Then 2. boycott that product or service...again, let the advertiser
know you're doing it. And why. Often, the advertiser simply isn't
aware of the offensive nature of the ad. A lot of consciousness can
be raised with one letter or a phone call.

Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Have to Survive

Casse tried to fight the
system but was under a lot of
pressure simply to survive. “I
had to put my monetary
needs, feeding and clothing
myself, before my art. This is
the kind of thing that happens
all the time; mine is simply a
specific situation.”

So Casse left the straight
record industry, tried the club
scene, which turned out to be
pretty much the same thing,
i.e., the “show-a-little-more-
tit-baby” attitude, and is now
working to create a woman’s
musical culture with the help
of her “womanger” Spotts-
wood. Why a “womanger”?
“The word ‘manager’,” says
Casse, “is derived from and
implies to ‘manipulate’; to
turn someone into a purchas-
able product.” This definitely
is not the relationship that
Casse and Spotts have. They
both put full time and energy
into getting Casse’s music out
to the public. Spotts takes
care of the business matters
and Casse works on her
music. Their expenses come
off the top of any income and
the rest is split 50-50.

Feels Great Now

How does Casse feel now
that she is performing her
music for women? Great! “In
the straight music industry, if
you're writing about anything
other than ‘my man is here
and I’m happy and satisfied’ or
‘my man is not here and I’m
miserable and blue’ you don't
have a market. Supposedly.”
Casse is finding her new
atmosphere highly supportive
and energizing. Women, she

eager for a whole new area of

expresses their own feelings
and struggles.

Her audiences have, in fact,
been so supportive that Casse

Sweet Alliance Music.

Through Casse’s efforts to
politicize and unite women
with their art she is giving us
the soul of woman, moving
freely out of her own life and
struggle. It is a beautiful and
brightly shining soul, and full
of smiles.

Colorado's First Feminist Paper Speaks Out
in 1800s

Open Letter

to Colorado Women

In a heavily guarded,
makeshift courtroom in the
Civil Defense building three
miles outside Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, a 56-year-old
Oglala Sioux woman is on trial
for riot charges. Sarah Bad
Heart Bull, an Indian mother
of 8 children, stands trial
because of her protest against
the white murderer of her
19-year-old son, Wesley, killed
in January, last year:

Wesley was stabbed to

death by Darryl Schmidt and

the state of South Dakota did
not feel it necessary to try a
white man for killing an
Indian. Sarah announced she
would travel (in the dead of
winter) from the Pine Ridge
Reservation to the distant
town of Custer to protest the
state’s inaction.

When Sarah and her sup-
porters arrived at the Custer
Courthouse to talk to authori-
ties, they were attacked by
riot policemen, arrested and
charged with conspiracy to
riot, riot where arson oc-
curred, disturbing the peace,
etc. Sarah was jailed and bail
of $8,000 was set.

When S.D. authorities
learned her bail would be
raised by an Indian Women’s
group, “Indian Women United
for Social Justice,” located in
Los Angeles, she was re-
leased on her own recogni-
zance.

Then in April of this year,
another son, Butch (age 18)
was shot to death by a white
man in Allen, Nebraska. Sarah
was further brutalized by the
S.D. authorities when she and
other Indian defendants would
not stand to show their
respect for the racist Judge
Bottum, who had allowed
white people who said they
hated Indians to be seated as
jurors. She and the others
were beaten, maced, and
tear-gassed in the courtroom
by police when they would not
stand.

The all-white jury has been
seated and it consists of 7
women and 5 men. Sarah and
the other Indian people are
poor and their legal defense
depends on urgently needed
donations from people across
the country. If you would like
to help Sarah Bad Heart Bull and
the other Indian defendants,
please send your donation to:
Wounded Knee Legal Defense
Fund, Offense Com., Box 255,
Sioux Falls, S.D. 57101.

Historical Society for his aid and

Due to the efforts of one
Caroline Nichols Churchill, a
woman of immense courage
and a staunch Feminist in her
time, Denver had a Feminist
Newspaper as early as Octo-
ber of 1879. This is the date of
the first publication of Ante-
lope. The reason for the name
Antelope was explained in
Volume I, issue 2 November
1879:

“Someone wants to know

why we call our paper the

Antelope.” We have several

reasons, which shall be

given as we “rise to
explain.” In the first place,
we wanted something that
had the least feminine
suggestion, something
graceful and beautiful ...
There is another reason for
calling our paper the Ante-
lope which we will give, but
modestly and blushingly,
inform our readers of this
last best cause least under-

stood: the Antelope is a

little deer, and is so difficult

to overtake.”

Caroline Nichols

was not only the editor of the

paper, she was also the
publisher and the woman
responsible for a large portion
of the paper's reporting. Many
of the issues that contempo-
rary Feminists are concerned

may be sent to the same
address.

Ed. Note: This letter from
Redbird (the chairperson of
Indian Women United for Social
Justice) was reprinted in part
from the July issue of Sister.
BMR supports this organization
and urges our readers to support
these issues as well.

with today were the subject of
articles and editorials in
Antelope. For example:
On Consciousness Raising
“There are plenty of women
in this land of freedom who
might better have borne
female pups and drowned
in puppyhood than to have
undertaken life with such
odds against them. The
manner in which women
conform to the errors of
education and submit to
imposition has no parallel
among men, although men
can be educated to fall
upon their faces before
fancied superiors, and to
echo the most absurd
opinions, dictated by their
lords. Persons must be
educated somewhat to a
sense of the injustice done
them before they are
capable of appreciating
assistance or sympathy.”
(Antelope, Vol. I, Issue 3,
Dec. 1879)

Paulette Nelson

At last, Pueblo has its own
women’s advocacy group in
the form of Women’s Informa-
tion Service of Pueblo. WISP
has been in existence for over
a year with the help of a
volunteer staff, and civic and
private donations. They now
have received an ACTION
mini-grant to use as seed
money for one year.

WISP seeks to increase
access to information, to
provide a missing service, and
to facilitate exchange of
resources between private
individuals in need. We hope
to mobilize a large number of
volunteers to obtain required
training, then branch out into
the areas of women’s pro-
blems, especially with low-
income and minority women.

Our staff usually consists
of women of all ages who have
been through some type of
crisis and feel they have
successfully gotten their lives
back together enough to help
someone else going through a
similar situation.

The location of WISP is

difference in the principle
that makes the Indian place
the pack upon the back of
his wife and the principle of
the class of men who will
form trade unions for the
purpose of excluding wo-
men of our towns and cities
from making a choice in
their occupations and

mode of life. The former
places his victim in the
position of abject slave to
his selfish will, the latter
ditto...” (Antelope, ibid)

On Sexism in the Media
“The papers speak of Mrs.
Romney who is now at
Leadville, as a very bright
woman. How would it
sound if we were to speak
of Ralph Waldo Emerson as
a bright man, of Horace
Greeley as a bright man, of
Jay Gould as a bright man?
Mrs. Romney is a very able
woman; one of superior
talents; one capable of
teaching many of the men
recognized as statesmen
today, and it makes us
fearfully jealous to hear
women spoken of thus by
the masculine press, and
we hope to see a reform in
this direction. No one
nowadays scarcely has
the audacity to

inferior unless it should be
a savage Indian or a stupid
foreigner. There are many
intelligent foreigners who
are in advance of the
Americans in recognition
of the claims of Women.”
(Vol. I, Issue 5, Feb., 1880)
ANTELOPE

On Caste Analysis
of Women
“If women or girls are ever
tempted to yield to the
selfish solicitations of men,
let them remember that
society is at present so
constructed as to hold but
one party responsible —
that for a general thing man
has a pride in whatever
woman is ashamed of
...Remember that everything
in nature exists by
contending forces by con-
traries...You will always be
persecuted. It matters not
whether rich or poor, if you
are at all worth noticing,
the good no more escape
ill-will than the vicious, and
are often perfect martyrs to
the tyranny of the wicked.
...When you marry take
your choice of men. If you
cannot do this have the
sublime courage to live and
die an old maid. Do this
rather than give your
children a bad or worthless
father. Better for them and
for you that they have no
father at all....” (Vol. 4,
Issue 8, May 1880)

Advice to Girls -

“Remember that the heart
of man is deceitful above
all things and desperately
wicked.” (Vol. I, Issue 3,
Dec. 1879)

We hope to be able to do a
series of articles about some
of our earlier Feminist Women
in Colorado and particularly
go into some in-depth
information about the Ante-
lope and its successor the
Queen Bee (another Feminist
paper published by Ms.
Churchill) as well as more

Rock-on Gray Panthers?

We challenge all forms of ageism and discrimination based on age.

We challenge compulsory retirement based on chronological age.

We seek the right to participate in determining policy and program decisions in the institutions that serve us.

We are a coalition of all ages, but especially the old and the young; who are outside the mainstream of society deprived of power and influence.

We seek improved public (Social Security) and private pension programs as well as better public and private health care, housing, and transportation, especially as these affect older people.

We are critical of the injustices, misplaced priorities, and discrimination based on race, sex, and age which exist in our society. We call for a reordering of national priorities which now favor military expenditures instead of supporting domestic needs, especially affecting older people.

We believe in direct action on behalf of these principles including researching, lobbying, and publicizing these issues, testifying at public hearings, and participating in public demonstrations.

These are the principles of the Denver Gray Panthers, part of a nationwide network of individuals and groups “drawn together by deeply felt common concerns for human liberation and social change.”

The Gray Panthers were born about four years ago in Philadelphia by a coalition of retired persons and students. Among the first issues dealt with were the war in Vietnam and increases in social security. Retired people had the time and the freedom to act without fear of losing their jobs. Such issues as a national health plan, public transportation for reduced fares, housing, job discrimination, court reform, corporate responsibility, and the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment have been part of the focus of the Gray Panthers in recent years.

The Denver chapter of the Gray Panthers was organized in April of this year and has been successful in having walklight signals on Colfax and other streets lengthened so that all people are able to cross the busy streets safely. The Traffic Engineering department has been “very responsive” to this problem according to Dortha Howe, a member of the Panthers.

Other activities of the Denver group are issue forums for state legislative candidates which were held in August in conjunction with Common Cause. More are scheduled for October and specific information can be obtained by calling Common Cause at 534-8259.

Consciousness raising groups are being started that will be open to all - young and old, men and women. Anyone interested can call Ms. Howe at 831-7707, afternoons.

A shared living house for older people has been established in Lakewood at a cost of about $150 a month. Contact Fran Yehle at 237-0839 or Ann Voiland at 237-2495 for more information.

Action around the issue of nursing homes will be discussed at the next meeting of the Gray Panthers which will be held at Sunset Park at 1865 Larimer, on September 9 at 1:30 pm.

Trichomonas: This is another vaginal infection caused by a tiny
one-celled animal that has little whip-like tentacles that help it
swim around.

Symptoms: Once again the vulva and outer vagina will itch and
become inflamed (sometimes the rectum will become inflamed
also). The discharge will be greenish-yellow and either slimy or
foamy and the smell will be rather odorous.

Treatment: The only cure that doctors have used thus far is a drug
called Flagyl or metronidazole which is taken orally. It is
expensive and causes uncomfortable side effects. Recent studies
have also shown that the drug may be carcinogenic (causing
cancer) when used on laboratory animals. In other words, as a
cure it leaves a lot to be desired. However, there are no other
known prescribed cures, and the only herbal cure I have heard of is
to use creosote as a douche. The Tribal Medicine Council
recommends creosote as an effective cure. (Another cute thing
about Flagyl is that it can kill off the normal bacteria of the vagina
too, and lead to a yeast infection.)

Non-Specific Vaginitis: This infection is caused by a certain
bacteria (not by yeast, trich, or gonorrhea) and is very tricky to
diagnose and get rid of. The bacteria causes trouble only when
something disrupts the natural chemical balance, like being sick
or run-down.
Symptoms: You will have an itchy inflamed vulva, and a white or
yellow discharge which contains cells and bacteria (under a
microscope) and may be streaked with blood. If the bacteria get
into your uterus, fallopian tubes, or bloodstream, you may feel
back pains and have cramps and swollen glands.
Treatment: Sulfa drugs are used in cream or suppository form
every morning and evening for ten days. Brand names are Vagitrol,
Sultrin, AVC cream. If you are allergic to sulfa drugs, get Furacin
Vag-15 suppositories or Betadine douche cream. All of these are
prescription drugs, and alas! I know of no herbal cures.
Hopefully, these descriptions will shed a little light on how
to deal with these damnable infections. Learning to effectively
diagnose does take time and practice, but basically it isn’t that
hard to do. If you have self-help classes that are being taught

where you live, go to them! You can learn a lot about yourself and
help break down the monopoly of power that the male-dominated
medical establishment has effectively kept us trapped with.
Self-determination!

Big Mama Benefit

Wine, Women, and Song
#1, Big Mama Rag’s first
benefit was held at the Oxford
Hotel Aug. 1. Attended by
over 200 people, we might
even go so far as to call the
benefit a smashing success.
Sue Isaacson and Judy
Sarchielli acted as moderators
for the benefit and also
entertained us with their skits
and general craziness! The
Raw Honey women’s band

which includes Judy Blair,
Chris Schmeltzer, Lorrie
Baun, Bean Hollander, and

Susan Nichols provided great
boogie music for everyone to
dance to (even in the streets)
and individual members of the
Motherfolkers heightened the
audience’s high energy for the
first part of the evening.
Casse Culver from Washing-
ton D.C. really helped to pull
the evening off with her
combination of voice, guitar,
harmonica and enthusiasm as
well as her politics. All the
members of Big Mama would
like to extend our special
thanks to all the women who
entertained and to all the
beautiful people who made
the evening so successful.
We’ll be having more such
events in the future and hope
to see you all there again!

An Evening With Eva

Shecat
Eva Freund was in town
Saturday night, August 10,

and no one took notes. For
one evening, this powerfully
dynamic Feminist shared her
energies with us, and the only
record is inscribed in our
consciousness.

The main thrust of what she
said concerned the dynamics
of Feminist group politics,
especially Lesbian interaction
with NOW and other organi-
zations. (Eva left the Gay
Activists Alliance to spend
more energies with women in
NOW on the National Lesbian
Task Force; she is no stranger
to struggle. The most comp-
rehensive gay anti-discrimin-
ation bill in the country was
passed recently in Washing-
ton, D.C., under her leader-
ship.)

One of the most significant
ideas she shared was the
concept of power bases; she

emphasized the necessity of
forcing power downward
through the ranks of every
group to give equal leadership
among the members. One
reason this is necessary is
that there are too many things
to be accomplished in a
Feminist society to expect a
few to carry out the demands
of the many. Also, in order for
every woman to feel the joy of
accomplishment, every wo-
man must carry her share of
the responsibility. This also
helps eliminate the burnout
factor among the leadership.
Rotating the duties of coor-
dinator on a frequent basis
(every few months) helps
achieve this goal.

Another way sharing power
bases can be accomplished is
for a small group (such as
Lesbians) to be outrageous (in
a variety of creative ways) and
then use that to raise

Lyn Alweis

consciousness. (Get the

group’s attention and then use
that power for positive
change.) No one is going to
validate Lesbians or straight
Feminists; we have to vali-
date ourselves, and we’d
better get busy.

Eva listened to our pro-
blems and our joys, shared
many valuable experiences of
Lesbian Feminist struggle,
and left us feeling positive
and strong. Eva Freund is
impossible to share with
others second-hand; she has
to be experienced.

Eva, if you read this, the
Colorado dykes you met love
you. We still have much to
share and much to give.
Please come back again.

Inmate Interview...

From Page 3

is Lt. Cooper. This is my
penitentiary. You do as we say
to do in here. You don’t go to
other girls’ rooms. There is no
body contact. You don’t
touch. We do not practice
homosexuality in our institu-
tion.”

So she runs it all down to you.
No body contact means that if
you had some death in your
family and you were crying,
and I’m one of your friends
and I come up to you and say,
“Hey, everything is gonna be
OK.” and I pat you on the back
to console you, then I’m
accused of being a homosex-
ual. That means that you and I
have a thing going because of
the fact that I’m patting you
and consoling you.

After you talk to the warden,
you go on up to your wing
area and they assign you to
your room. You might meet
some of the girls in that wing
area. I put all my things on the
bed, then I went out with one
of the girls that knew me. We
went outside. I was shaking
like this. I was really nervous
because I’d never been around
a lot of people, especially
women, in the joint and it
really got to me.

BMR: What’s the daily rou-
tine? Does everybody work?

RL: Six o’clock in the morning
they come over the speaker
and say, “Good morning
ladies. It’s six o'clock.”
BMR: The rest of

are girls.
you're ladies?

RL: Right. Six-thirty comes
and it’s time for count. You're
laying in your bed, really
resting. Six-thirty comes and
you have to get up out of your
bed, go to the door and stick
your arm out until the officer
comes down and counts every
arm. On her way up, she says,
“Thank you” and you can put
your arm back in. If you want
to stay up, you stay up. You
have to be out of your room
for breakfast at 7 am.

You go to the dining room and
you have to sit at the seat
where you're assigned. After
breakfast you have your
medication. If you work on the
cleaning crew you have to go
down to the auditorium at
8:00. If you’re in the sewing
room you have to be there at
8:00.

BMR: How many different
work areas are there?

RL: You have the cleaning
crew, the sewing room, the
yard crew, the state and
industrial sewing room. You
can work in the library or the
kitchen.

BMR: Does the women’s
kitchen prepare food for the
men’s prison, too?

RL: No. Only for the women.
In the women’s kitchen, they
don't have enough stuff to
work with, as far as cooking is
concerned. Not enough sea-
sonings. And they have a food
service class! Now you can
have vocational training. You
can take typing, bookkeeping,
shorthand, and filing. That’s
it. Now I’ve been through all of
that. I didn’t have anything to
do.

BMR: Are the classes every
day?

RL: Every day of the week.
But you have to do your work
detail. In the laundry you
might be there an hour. On the
cleaning crew you go to work
at 8 and you might get off at
11. You never know how long
you may have to work.

BMR: Which means when you
get up in the morning, if you
have something you want to
do that day, like writing or
something, you never know
during that day when you're
going to have some time to
yourself.

RL: Right.

Interviewer’s note: If an
inmate at CWC doesn’t
behave in the approved
manner, the prison adminis-
tration has a number of ways
to pressure her into obedi-
ence. One of the more
effective ways is to threaten
her with an extension of her
sentence. This threat keeps
many women from speaking
or rebelling. Another disci-
plinary method, which has
both immediate and long-term
implications, is to place a
woman in lock-up by herself.

BMR: Can you tell us
something about lock-up?

RL: It’s the same room that
you have isolation when you
first come in.

BMR: What’s in there?

a blanket
washcloth. What was so
funny about it was that they
took the string out of my
pajamas so I couldn’t hang
myself, but if I'd wanted to, all
I'd had to do was to take the
radio earphones and hang
myself. They were still in
there. Or the sheets. I could
have taken my pajamas off
and hung myself too.

BMR: Do people use cigar-
ettes as barter in the women’s
prison?

RL: Some people might. I
don’t. See, you get two
packages of Pall Mall on
Friday. They give you one bar
of soap. You can get 12 Kotex.

BMR: No tampons?

RL: If you want Tampex you
have to take your own money
and buy them.

BMR: What is contraband
here?

RL: We can’t have gum. The
reason for that they say is
because ten years ago Sally
Sue had gum and she jammed
a lock. Or five years ago
somebody had gum that she
stuck on her plate and it got
jammed in the dishwasher.
You can’t have lighters.
Because if there was lighter
fluid around you could start
somebody on fire. Our people
can’t send anything in, like
homemade goodies. Something
might be in it. They’re afraid your parents might put
some dope in it.

BMR: Are drugs easily availa-
ble?

RL: No, but you can get drugs
into the institution.

BMR: What are some of the
ways that women relieve
themselves of the insanity
here?

RL: Well, now we can have
tapes and radios in our rooms.
And you can read or knit or
crochet. That's what I don't
understand about all this
contraband. You can’t have
matches and all this other
stuff, but you can have
scissors and knitting needles,
needles, pins. Knives are
contraband. If you want a
knife, all you got to do is go
down to the kitchen, put it in
your sock and walk back to
your room.

BMR: What else can you do?

RL: Well, you can pick up a
book or do whatever you want
in your room. But really you
don’t have privacy in your
room. The officers come and
look in all the time.

BMR: And you can’t have a
friend in?

RL: Not in your room.

BMR: So what you’re saying
is that in the women’s prison
there’s very little contact
between the women as indivi-
duals?

RL: Right. Very little.

BMR: I'd like for you to talk a
little bit about being gay in
and out of prison.

RL: Okay. Well me, for
instance. I’m gay. I was gay
when I came in and I'll be gay
when I leave. In the prison,
you’re around women. You
might see someone you might
dig on and you might want to
be with that person. So you
rap to each other and you get
real close to her.

BMR: When do you get a
chance to talk to her?

RL: When the yard is open. Or
going to dinner together. If
you're in different wings, then
you can go over to her wing
and talk to her. You just go
and stand at her door. She
might pull a chair up to the
door. But you can’t go inside
anyone's living quarters but
the one you're in. You can talk
in the beauty shop when you
are doing each other’s hair.

BMR: That's the only body
contact you can have?

RL: Yes, when you're doing
somebody's hair.

BMR: How many women in
the institution are Lesbians?

RL: There are so many
changes coming down here.
There’s probably only two for
real. Then there’s some that
came into the institution and
don’t have anything better to
do than this, get it on with
women. They think, “I got to do
my time. I might as well have
somebody to do this with.”
It's an outlet.” So they get
involved. But there’s not that
many who come in gay.

BMR: What are some of the
differences that you can see
between what happens in the
women’s prison and in the
men’s prisons?

RL: They have more freedom
than we women do. I guess
that’s because there are more
men locked up than there are
women.

Interviewer’s note: Ronnell
didn’t expand on this point. A
noticeable difference between
the men’s and women’s
institutions is the larger
variety of vocational training
and educational opportunities
available to men. It seems that
there are also fewer petty
rules at the men's prisons.

BMR: What do you think is
our responsibility as women
outside to those of you who
are inside?

RL: Women on the outside,
not being aware of prison and
how it really is, should get
some type of group together
and come and visit the
women's institution. They
should see how each woman
feels in there about being
locked up. There needs to be
more communication among
all women, inside and out.
There are some women inside
who have kids. There are
women on the street who have
kids and they're not away from
their kids. They need to know
how it feels to be away from
your child, being confined,
doing time. Women on the
outside have no knowledge of
this. You need to see how a
woman feels when she has to
go and do time and when she
gets out her child doesn’t
know her.

Like the NOW women came
down and one lady brought her
little boy down. Everybody
was really enthused. But if
they had their kids to come in,
they would be more happy
than they are now.

BMR: In other words, people
on the outside should try to
find out who has a child and
bring them along when we
come to visit.

RL: That’s one of the
things I want to do when I get
out. I want to relate to women
on the outside that prison life
is not for a woman. It’s really
not. I want women to know,
“Hey, don’t commit any
crimes. If you got a man and
he’s pimping you, tell him you
want to do something better
than going to prison.” You got
responsibilities out there. You
got more responsibilities if
you got a child. Say one of the
my best friends had a case.
She might have ten kids.
She’s worried about what her
kids are going to do, whether
they’re going to go on welfare
or the welfare department is
going to take them away from
her and all this. Before I see
her kids given away, I'll take
the rap for her.

Interviewers note: This was
all the time we had to talk with
Ronell during our initial visit.
She is interested in staying in
touch with women outside of
prison. Those of you who are
concerned about women in-
mates should consider visit-
ing the women at CWC and
possibly taking an inmate's
child for a visit. For more
information about the subject,
read Women in Prison by

The new Feminist quarterly Quest is the most exciting new journal since the Amazon Quarterly. The editors read like a who's who of dedicated grassroots Feminists with a long history of impressive movement activities: Rita Mae Brown, Charlotte Bunch, Karen Kollias, plus women from other countries. This is the Quest editorial policy: Quest: A Feminist quarterly is seeking long-term in-depth political analysis and ideological development. Quest is not an end in itself, but a process leading to new directions for the Women’s Movement possibly including such concrete forms as regional or national conferences, a national organization or a political party. We, the editors, are all women who have been in the movement for several years and have reached a point where each answer leads us to more questions. We have been through various ideological and activist metamorphoses and end up feeling that our overall perspective is still not adequate. Where has the struggle brought us? Closer to real economic, political, and social power for women? Closer to an end of exploitation of and violence against women? Closer to self-determination for all women? We do not have all the answers ourselves and expect that Feminists across the country and the world will contribute to this process of seeking. 

The first issue begins to describe the process of changes in a Feminist revolution. Future issues will be on fame and power, the selfhood of women, women and spirituality, and visions and fantasies.

Charlotte Bunch’s criteria of differentiating necessary reformist programs like ERA or daycare centers from co-opting ones like more women executives was excellent. Rita Mae Brown, in her Good Fairy role, was funny and brilliant in her analysis of Lesbian Feminism. Her concrete examples of body language were differences among non-feminists, Feminists, and Lesbian/Feminists is a fine example of how head changes produce large, readily-seen body language changes. The patriarchy will end when women take up more space. A woman’s space is large. The last article describes the three main divisions of the present Women’s Movement: the existential, the reformist, and the anti-capitalist. The insights and drawbacks of each section are discussed accurately. The need for conscious political education within all groups is the timely conclusion to this well thought out piece.

Because of its in-depth analysis of the complex patriarchy, it is not easy reading. Quest is clearly written and concise, but due to the enormity of its task, quite a bit of work is needed to understand it. The patriarchy is big and ugly. So let us meet the monster head on. Let’s study Quest. Let us learn to outthink the beast, let us make our place, our present head confusion, a better place - a woman’s place. Read - Study - Subscribe to Quest.

Psychology of Women:  
A Study of Bio-Cultural  
Conflicts. .  

Judith M. Bardwick.  
Harper & Row, New  
York, NY: 1971.  

In Psychology of Women,  
Judith M. Bardwick, Ph.D.,  
has confirmed and acknowledged the experiences that  
Every Woman has had. No  
longer need we worry about  
“penis envy”: we have our  
own reproductive organs and  
our own perceptions and our  
own reasons for feeling and  
acting as we do, in spite of the  
male sex.  

Bardwick herself has a  
Ph.D. and three children. She  
thinks that maternity and  
taking care of the young are  
crucial experiences for the  
self-identity of women. She  
claims that little girls don’t  
grieve for the penises they never  
had. As anyone who has been  

around little children will  
attest: a little girl who sees a  
pregnant woman is very proud  
to hear that she too might one  
day have a big belly and a  
baby (if she wants to). In other  
words, girls have their own  
source of pride and identity,  
right there in their own  
bodies.  

The notorious “passivity” of  
women just might happen to  
be functional, a necessary  
coping technique during such  
crises as pregnancy. (A  
woman who answers the  
demands of small children  
can hardly be called passive!)  

Bardwick discusses at  
length the relationship of  
women to their bodies. As it  
turns out, our bodies are  
fascinating. The menstrual  
cycle is a finely orchestrated  
balance of hormones, some-  
times operating in high gear  
and sometimes in low gear.  
When our hormonal levels are  
high, there is some indication  
in the research that it might  

contribute to a positive,  
nurturant psychological state.  
Pregnancy is one time of high  
hormonal levels -- and preg-  
nancy is certainly a time when  
a positive, well-integrated  
personality is very important  
to the well-being of the future  
child.  

Bardwick also talks about  
possible causes of heightened  
sexual arousal during mens-  
truation. She also suggests  
some possible psychological  
effects of taking birth control  
pills.  

Bardwick also describes the  
cultural influences on young  
women experiencing mens-  
truation, their first inter-  
course, marriage, orgasm,  
childbirth, etc. Some of her  
theories are as yet unprova-  
ble, but it is nevertheless  
worthwhile to read a feminine  
rendition of all the life crises  
that men are so vocal about.  

Again and again the author  
describes the denigration of  
female achievements in a  

culture which values male-  
ness. This is the part that  
roused the old feminist anger  
in me. While girls are being  
told to succeed scholastically,  
on the one hand, and then  
told not to do too well, on the  
other hand (so that they don't  
alienate prospective hus-  
bands); while they're being  
told that having babies and  
taking care of a home and  
husband are the most crea-  
tive, most contributory things  
they could do; they are  
simultaneously being put  
down for being “just house-  
wives”. As Bardwick notes in  
her chapter entitled “The  
Motive to Achieve”, the  
highest accolades of this  
society go to men who are  
competitive and achievement-  
oriented. If women exhibit the  
same behaviors, they’re told  
that they’re being “unfemin-  
ine”. Damned if you do and  
damned if you don't.  
Bardwick’s theory of an  
“affiliative motive” in women  

Page 15  

probably is the most contro-  
versial part of the book (or at  
least to a lot of women today  
who are trying to explore their  
achievement needs). She says  
that, given all the condition-  
ing that we've had, and  
possibly also due to genetic  
givens, a young girl has a  
need to establish a related-  
ness to a man and to her  
children. She will supposedly  
feel anxious if she fails to  
fulfill the traditional female  
role for a while.  

At any rate, whatever your  
sex or your persuasion, I think  
that this book would be a  
pleasure to read--if only  
because an intelligent woman  
has devoted a lot of serious  
thinking and a lot of research  
to the biological and cultural  
realities of womanhood today.  

Magazines  
Womansports  

Elisa Laramore  

Athletics and sports are  

rapidly arising into their  
rightful positions in women’s  
daily lives. With this new  
awareness women are feeling  
health, strength, and a new  
purpose.  

It seems only natural that  
this fresh power should be  
shared with one another. One  
method of sharing ideas and  
experiences is through the  
media.  

Just recently introduced  
into the vast spectrum of  
journalistic media is Billie  
Jean King’s publication wo-  
men Sports. Born out of anger  
about almost non-existent  
media coverage of women’s  
sporting events, women-  
Sports is definitely a sight for  

Amazon Quarterly  

Sandy Belgrade  

This critique started out to  
be a magazine review, but  
something more than an  
issue-by-issue analysis  
seems needed. To dismiss  
Amazon Quarterly as just one  
more printed contribution is  
to miss the point for the  
magazine and for ourselves.  
What I really want to discuss  
are the promises and vision of  
a women’s culture and the  
way Amazon Quarterly fits  
into that perspective.  

In its short herstory, the  
Women’s Movement has  
reached a point of promise,  
one that reads: we are no  
longer concerned with re-  
formist issues, nor with one  
more periodical which just  
‘reports and records and does  
so in a timely way. We are, I  
believe, at the point which can  
be interpreted as follows:  
enough rhetoric. Enough con-  
fessions and personal odys-  
seys. While these fulfill me on  
one level in that they let me  

very sore eyes.  
The text is fascinating to  

me and I find myself drinking. =  

Indeed this magazine is long  
overdue. The regular features  
include “Kickers” - a potpourri  
of breakthroughs and unusual  
happenings; “In a Pigs Eye” -  
delightful satire; “Aces” -  
write-up on women who win it  
all; “Foremothers” - a new  
look at herstory; “Off the  
Wall” - funny stuff, but sad,  
and “Snapshot” - seeing is  
believing.  

The articles themselves are  
the real fruit and vegetables of  
this magazine. I delight in  
seeing everyone from the  
superstars to the novice  
athlete -- real people just like  
you and I. The women  
describe in detail their experi-  
ences which are deep and  
sensual. Informative articles  

know others feel as I do (i.e.  
have taken the shit as long as  
I have), they do not fill a much  
larger need. A need which  
recognizes our disaffection  
with the realities, our desire  
for theory and more concrete  
suggestions for positive ac-  
tion.  

What this quarterly promis-  
es is that it can incorporate all  
forms of writing and stimulate  
women to action through its  
sense of vision. This is a  
moment in time when power  
and vision are yearning to be  
reconciled, and it is in light  
of vision with the promise of  
action that this commentary  
on AQ is offered.  

Started by Gina and Laurel  

This quarterly, which will be  
two years old in October, was  
begun on the West Coast by  
two Lesbian Feminists, Gina  
and Laurel. Unlike that slick  
New York operation which  
claims to speak for MS, AQ  
does not speak for women on  
a “radical chic” level, nor do  
they see themselves as merely  
an art journal. In their first  
anniversary issue, Gina stated  

on ‘How to’ just about  
anything are plentiful.  

The most Moving  

The Agony of Victory” written  
by a middle-aged marathon  
runner who finished last - but  
she finished. The very fact  
that this article was published  
shows some real understand-  
ing of what it’s like to be a  
woman athlete -- win or lose.  

I'm impressed with the  
women in these articles, I had  
no idea women were compet-  
ing in so many fields and so  
well. Inspired is putting it  
lightly.  

I must be honest however  
and point out what I feel to be  
some real drawbacks. First  
and foremost Billie’s shallow  
Feminism. Allowing such  
inane articles as “Why Women  
Lose” by Dr. Thomas Bos-  

that she wanted to see the  
paper evolve from being some  
static entity. That unlike  
society which as a whole  
emphasizes nouns and there-  
fore fixed identities, they  
wanted AQ to verb, to  
participate actively in the  
creation of a woman-  
centered culture. There are  
millions of women hungry for  
provocative articles which will  
force them to rethink lan-  
guage and give them the kind  
of insights that can result in  
definitive action. A look at one  
recent theoretical essay may  
illustrate how the best in  
writing can be words that are  
accurate maps of the world  
and our role therein to bring  
about true social change.  

In Vol. 2, Issue 2, Laurel  
powerfully dissects the male  
mirror, her symbol for the  
complete and pervasive way  
that the patriarchy emits and  
reflects its own image and  
values in the world. Patriarch-  
al influence is so widespread  
that even total separatism  
does not wipe out its  
corrosive effects. While many  

issue “The Thrill of Defeat,  

looper and Marcia Hays (July  
1974) is evidence on that  

hardly a tribute to the goals of  
the Feminist movement at  
large. I personally would like  
to see womenSports become  
more radical in that respect.  
Image building--a nice middle  
class publication that poses  
little threat to the male-dom-  
inated press is one irritation  
for me. However I suppose  
they must keep their adver-  
tisers happy. Possibly that’s  
why they ignore the blatant  
fact that many of our lovely  
heroines are Lesbians. Preen-  
ing and primping still lives as  
they purposely emphasize the  
beauty queen aspects of some  
of the superstars like horse  
racing's Mary Bacon, Miss  
San Bernardino of San Diego  
basketball fame, and lovely  

women writers have written in  
response to the negative,  
existential rays coming from  
that mirror, trying to form  
their own values in its  
reflection as it were, too few  
have surfaced to transcend it.  
The smashing of that mirror  
and the corresponding creation  
of a mirror that reflects  
the feminine principle is the  
beginning of woman vision--  
one that is in touch with the  
needs of the earth, one that  
speaks to the female process  
ethic.  

Communication Lifeline  

This is communication  
looked at as a lifeline and a  
network to establish a vision  
in which we can all partici-  
pate. It speaks to us from the  
depths of our hope, and it can  
be our source of strength if  
words really can be tangential  
to action. What AQ intends is  
no less than the complete  
demise of the phallocentric  
system that purged our  
herstory before and will again  
unless we act this time  
around.  

Glenna Sacks, racecar driver.  
It isn’t easy to tolerate  

unless she’s queer?” (Mary  
Bacon July 1974 pp. 33). Or  
negative inferences that gym  
teachers and/or athletic wo-  
men are gay, Billie Jean and  
company are bending over  
backwards to deny what every  
one knows. Even Newsweek  
will casually admit “There are  
a number of Lesbians among  
touring pro athletes...”  
(Newsweek, June 3, 1974, pp.  
52) womenSports seems to be  
suffering from a bad case of  
Closetitis.  

Harsh words aside - wo-  
menSports is informative, fun  
and necessary. I wish them all  
the success and good fortune  
they deserve and I hope to see  
many more issues.  

Amazon Quarterly holds the  
promise of being a forum for  
women to communicate what  
the feminine mirror can be and  
how each of us can contri-  
bute. It is true that several  
topics I would like discussed  
have not yet been dealt with  
(for example, I would like an  
in-depth essay on how the  
divisive aspects can be  
dispelled, especially those of  
class and race since for too  
many women the movement  
has a middle class aura).  
However, as Amazon Quarter-  
ly begins its third year we  
might heed their call for more  
contributions from women: to  
read it, to share it, to  
transform it is no less than a  
call to active participation in  
our lives and the end of being  
mute witnesses and readers.

Whe Weve the  

Linda Fowler  

As you have all surely noticed, Big Mama Rag has been  
changing fast, and growing so rapidly we can hardly keep up with  
her. We thought you'd like to know what’s happening with your  
newspaper, beyond the printed page - inside BMR.  

We also want to let you know what some of our needs are  
and hope you will let us know about yours. Our aim is to  
continually increase BMR’s effectiveness as a service and  
communication organ for all women.  

Perhaps the printed page is a good place to begin.  

During the past few months, BMR has doubled in size. The  
features section has been expanded with more in-depth coverage  
of issues relevant to local women. We have added more interviews  
with both local and nationally known Feminists, expanded the  
poetry section, increased book and film reviews, added regional  
news, national news, a Women and Advertising column, and a  
calendar of events. Plans are to add a financial column (to help  
women with money planning and management), to expand  
coverage of working women and labor union women, and to add a  
section on the herstory of women. Casse Culver and Spottswood  
suggested more analysis of the political aspects of Lesbianism.  
We hope to offer more here.  

What We Need  

We need writers to help with features, articles on theory,  
analysis, news stories, and poetry. Along with the larger BMR  
have come needs for more graphics—send yours in! We need a  
graphics editor; someone to take on the job of finding artists,  
lining up what needs to be done, doing it or getting it done. We  
also desperately need a good proofreader, experienced, if  
possible. This job would take about six hours per month.  

More advertising to pay increased printing costs; call us  
(322-2010) if you can help sell ads (even 2 or 3 hours per week). If  
you know a business which might take an ad, call us. Take a  
classified with us—8 cents per word.  

The demand for the paper is rapidly growing. Every day  
women call the office asking where BMR can be bought, and our  
distribution outlets are increasing. We plan to triple (for a start)  
these outlets and are working on this now. It’s a big job. Please  
help. We need women to get new outlets, stock existing ones, and  
ultimately we will need someone to take over distribution  
coordination entirely. This involves responsibility for all mailings.  

Income is increasing, but so are expenses, so we are still  
not out of the dark here. We're picking up about 30 new subs per  
month, plus doing bulk mailings to bookstores and women’s  
centers around the country.  

We're increasing promotional activities and hope to offer  
more women’s cultural events: music, poetry readings, film  
series, etc.  

We need: more subscriptions... Encourage everyone you  
know to subscribe. Pledges... No amount too small or too large. $  
for salaries... A better BMR requires more time from staffers.  
Many are volunteers, some receive a bare subsistence wage.  
Putting out the paper is a full-time job and can’t be done without  
some salary money. If you know individuals or community-minded  
groups who could contribute to this, please encourage them to  
do so.  

Where We Work  

We've recently doubled office space to accommodate our  
increased activities. We need: desks, overhead lights, chairs,  
paint, envelopes (business size), thumb tacks, a 4x6 file card box,  
note pads, lettering for our door, money (the rent went up).  

We've talked a lot about classism and plan an issue on class  
and Feminism, possibly for October. We also plan issues on day  
care, women and madness, women in the military, revolution  
(psychic, physical, spiritual, personal, political).  

We hope to publish a poetry anthology from past BMR’s in  
time for Christmas.  

We are trying now to make BMR a regional women's  
newspaper for the West. We need correspondents and distribution  
points in all Western states. If you have contacts, let us know  
about them, or them about us.  

One of our big dreams is to publish every two weeks. We're  
tentatively aiming for January or February of 1975. This is going to  
require more full-time staffers and, thereby, more money for  
salaries to pay these staffers. We're checking out possibilities of  
grants for this purpose. If you have ideas on this, we'd love to hear  
them.  

What We’re Thinking About  

Five of us are now living collectively, sharing a painting job  
and a secretarial job and working almost full-time on BMR. Big  
Mama pays one $250/month salary, which we also share. (We are  
house painters—if you know of any jobs we can bid on, please get  
in touch.)  

In our personal lives we have been dealing with the overall  
question of a woman's civilization and what that means. We feel a  
woman’s civilization has to happen on all levels: cultural,  
spiritual, political, personal, and philosophical, and are working  
on these areas within our living collective and within BMR.  

Living collectively has brought us many challenges and  
many changes. And a lot of personal growth. We've had to define  
and re-define our purpose and the way each one of us fits into  
that. We've become more responsible to ourselves, each other,  
and the women's community. We are stimulated; we work harder;  
we see results; these results, in turn, give us added stimulus.  

But while our minds and souls are turned on, our bodies are  
exhausted. We’re looking for ways to solve that problem, for we  
learned long ago the farce of altruism.  

If you can share your work with Big Mama, Big Mama can  
share her satisfaction with you, a reciprocal arrangement.  
Reciprocity, fairness, holding together is what this Women’s  
Movement is about.

Lawsuit...  

From Page 3  

besieged by many of these  
things. That men have more  
opportunities than women is a  
matter of opinion since the  
average time for a girl here is  
14 months and we have a low  
recidivism rate of 6%. We feel  

that we are doing a good job...  

We have never lost a life here  
for any cause. We're doing  
what we can. We're not on the  
defensive about the lawsuit -  
we're not uptight about it.”  

Poor Medical Care  
Specific charges in the  
lawsuit include the following:  
“Women have been denied and  
are being denied necessary  
medical care, resulting in  
serious medical problems, the  
full extent of which is not at  
this time known to the  
plaintiffs." That is being inves-  
tigated by a medical screening  
arranged through the Medical  
Committee for Human Rights.  
Volunteer doctors, nurses and  
clerical people will conduct  
complete physical examina-  
tions to gather data to clarify  
the allegations. There have  
been serious medical pro-  

blems reported at the wo-  

men’s facility such as persist-  
ent bleeding that was seen as  
“normal” by the staff physi-  
cian and improper diet for a  
diabetic woman who wasn’t  
receiving the proper leafy  
greens and protein she need-  
ed. It seems that there is no  
dietician at the prison, that  
inmates are chiefly responsi-  
ble for cooking food and that  
often the specific items  

are unavailable in the prison  
kitchen resulting in unhealthy  
substitutions.  

According to Rudy San  
Fellipo, the new Director for  
the Department of Institu-  
tions, medical care at Colora-  
do State Penitentiary is “just  
not adequate at all.”  

But Ms. Gillespie, who is in  
charge of the women’s facili-  
ty, sees the medical screening  
as “just another one of those  
things...there is no special  
reason they came down.” The  
lawsuit states that the defen-  
dants “have the power to  
alleviate the conditions there  
(at CWIC) but have not  
exercised that power.”  

Women prisoners are also  
“denied the opportunity  
granted other inmates to  
participate in work-release  
and pre-parole programs and  
have less access to educa-  
tional and vocational rehabili-  
tative programs than the  
general prison population.”  
Since the suit was filed, some  
women have been allowed  
limited participation in pre-  
parole activities. They can  

now watch films and listen to  
lectures on ways to readjust  
to the outside, but women  
cannot live in the pre-parole  
center that is separated from  
all other prison housing for a  

month prior to their release as  
men do. Instead, the women  
in the pre-parole program are  
forced to move to a separate  
wing at CWCI and given “more  
privileges, more freedom, and  
possible furloughs” according  
to Ms. Gillespie.  

The academic program for  
the women allows some to get  
a high school equivalency  
diploma and some to compete  
with the general prison popu-  
lation in competitive exams to  
attend classes sponsored by  
Southern Colorado State Col-  
lege.  

Unequal Pay  

Another allegation in the  
suit is that women are “paid  
poorer wages for the work  
they do in prison and they are  
assigned duller, less useful,  
and less rehabilitative jobs”  
than are other inmates.  
According to the women’s  
warden the girls can “sew,  
iron, cook, take business  
classes and learn cosmetolo-  
gy.” At the other facilities  
(that are only for male  
prisoners) there are such  
“jobs” and “training” as  
carpentry, machine shops,  
mechanics, print shop, the  
dairy and many more.  

Women in the sewing  
rooms at CWIC start at 15  
cents a day and can earn up to  
45 cents a day. The machines  
are antiquated and aren't the  
kinds of machines you would  
have to know how to operate  
to get a good job on the  

outside. “The men use the  
machines they send them over to us and  

they’re all wrecked by that  
time,” says an unidentified  
inmate. “We sew shirts all day  
for the men’s side and for all  
the other state institutions.  
For 15 cents a day. We work  
just to keep this state going.”  

The usual argument for  
equal facilities for men and  
women is that there are only  
60 women in prison and 1250  
men. But according to Joan  
Tempko, the facilities should  
be shared by both the men  
and the women “we don’t  
want separate but equal  
facilities.”  

Women have been and  
continue to be arbitrarily pun-  
ished for violating unwritten  
rules of which they have never  
been notified, according to  
the suit. Violation of these  
rules “are determined without  
any due process guarantee,  
but they are noted in the  
prison records and may affect  
the granting or denial of  
parole” to women inmates.  

Ms. Gillespie says: “We do  
have now a set of overall rules  
for everyone in the institution.  
They are not approved as yet  
but everyone is working on  
them.” (What? -ed.)  

Women supposedly are no  
longer being written up for  
violation of rules, but they are  

still not told the consequenc-  
es of breaking certain rules,  
according to Ms. Tempko of  
the Law Collective.  

No Body Contact  

The women offenders are  
given “less opportunity to  
associate among themselves,  
have shorter and more re-  
stricted visiting hours and  
have less of a chance to  
associate with people outside  
the prison than do other  
inmates of the penitentiary.  
The Associate Warden ex-  
plains: “Visiting on weekends  
is discouraged during the  
week since programs at the  
institution would be inter-  
rupted.”  

As far as visiting among  
themselves, there is the no  
body contact rule still in force  
and it seems that the principle  
reason for it is the fear of  
homosexuality at the prison.  
Ms. Gillespie says that “we  
don’t have a real problem  
{about Lesbianism)...we don’t  
try to moralize about it at all.  
Most of them are just  
situational homosexuals  
which may indicate a need for  
affection, for someone to  
care.”  

Mail has allegedly been  
censored and delayed without  
regard for the feelings of  
recipients. But the official  
policy of the institution is that  
mail is never censored, never  
marked out or changed - just  
read for “security reasons.”  

The women do not have  
access to a complete law  
library or to jailhouse lawyers  
as the rest of the prison  
population does. The law  
library that does exist in the  

women's institution is “inad-  
equate.”  

The single nurse that works  
at the women’s facility is only  
there part of the day. At other  
times “untrained, unqualified  
staff dispense dangerous pre-  
scription medicine. Since  
inmates do not know what  
medicine they are supposed  
to be receiving, mistakes have  
been made and will continue  
to be made, with one inmate  
being given the drugs pre-  
scribed to a different inmate.”  
Women are also “denied  
access to the entertainment  
and culture available to the  
general prison population,  
and the movies, cultural  
programs and library books  
which are available at CWIC  
do not reflect the (women’s)  
cultural backgrounds or suit  
their tastes.”  
It is because of the  
separation on the basis of  
their sex that the women in  
the Colorado State Peniten-  
tiary system are “subjected to  
numerous rules and restric-  
tions they otherwise would  
not be, are treated like  
children in an insulting and  
degrading manner, and are  
denied many comforts and  
conveniences they would oth-  
erwise enjoy.”

and men prisoners practically
end here and this ending is
directly due to the sexism of
the patriarchy.

Laws themselves are based
on two different standards of
morality and behavior and
these built-in sex biases
determine the kinds of crimes
a woman is sentenced for and
the length of her sentence.
For example, a woman may be
prosecuted for prostitution
while her male solicitor is
rarely if ever taken to task.

In an article by Marie-An-
dree Bertrand entitled, “The
Myth Of Sexual Equality
Before the Law,” she con-
cludes that women are treated
more severely or more leni-
ently according to the social
value threatened by the
offense. A teenage woman,
for example, may be prose-
cuted for a crime such as
promiscuity while a young
man may often be charged
with crimes against property
such as vandalism or car
theft. He is prosecuted for an
offense against capitalism.
She is prosecuted for an
offense against the patriar-
chy.

Oftentimes, a woman will
be sentenced more harshly
than a man would be for the
same offense because the
misbehavior of women with
regard to certain crimes (such
as burglary or murder) is
considered more serious.
She, being a woman and the
so-called guardian of the
threatening the
entire fabric of society when

she behaves as violently as
men do. (Consequently, she is
locked up to relearn her
woman’s role which she has
stepped out of in this way.)
The kinds of crimes which
women do actually commit
most often are usually direct-
ed inward at themselves. In
the FBI’s Uniform Crime
Reports these crimes are
listed as theft, forgery,
prostitution, narcotics,
drunkenness, and disorderly
conduct. “Not only are these
the more subtle (more “femin-
ine”) forms of criminal behav-
ior, they are also the least
destructive of other persons
and property. Four of these
crimes are also referred to as
“crimes without victims—”
other than the doer. Women
are socialized to be passive,
to direct their energies in-
wards, towards themselves.
Therefore women, instilled
with a negative sense of self
(or no sense of self at all)
often turn to drugs and
alcohol for escape. For this,
women are either locked up in
a prison or more frequently
confined to mental institu-
tions. 

Once a woman has been
sentenced for any crime,
however, she is incarcerated
in an institution whose
primary purpose centers a-
round imposing and reinforc-
ing her typical feminine role.
What the outside patriarchal

world thinks she should be is
now carried out as law
the institution itself. Also,
because there are fewer

women in prison than men
and because it is generally
considered more important
that men be “rehabilitated,”
the little money which is
available for institutions us-
ually goes to the men.
Consequently, financial aid
for women’s programs is
relatively sparse.

The money which is availa-
ble to women’s prisons often
goes toward teaching the
women certain vocations
which reinforce her stereo-
typed role and also are
practically useless to her in
surviving once she does get
released. At both Canon City
and the Denver County Jail,
for example, the women learn
(as if they didn’t already know
in the first place) to work in
the kitchen or in the laundry,
to sew, crochet, and knit, and
to do each other's hair! At
Canon City, women may also
learn clerical skills and there
is opportunity to get a high
school education, but at

Denver County the opportuni-
ty to get a high school degree
is sporadic,

whether a volunteer (from the
Opportunity School) is availa-
ble to teach the women.
Classes for women are few at
Canon City and non-existent
at Denver County.

At both prisons (and they
are by no means atypical of
women's prisons all over the
country) the emphasis again
is on reinforcing passivity.
Women are always referred to
as the “girls”—symbolizing
powerlessness, child-like
qualities, dependence etc. ad
nauseum.

Description and analysis of
women’s prisons and the
attitudes surrounding them
has been necessarily abridged
in this article because of
space limitations. A lot more
thought and action needs to
be focused on this area and in
the future BMR hopes to be
running more articles about
women in prison,

so well in her article on
“Women of the Convicted
Class,” in a society which, in
addition to being racist and
exploitative, is sexist, the

remind the reader that the
question of who will act is
crucial and is what has led to
the formation of independent
autonomous movements for
liberation. Everyone can talk
about oppression, but only
those most immediately af-
fected and committed will
actually seize the time and
know how and when to move
on their own liberation.”

extra for the guards to worry
about. So we got to have it.
During the picnic someone
took a tennis shoe and started
running around. We are never
allowed any horseplay but
when we all started running
around playing none of the
guards moved. This was when
the associate warden was
under pressure during the
investigations and I guess she
thought it would be better not
to do anything. And believe
me, there could have been
scores of male guards from
the medium security prison
that is just over the hill there
in a second if she wanted
them.

Getting It Together

When you first go down
there they give you education
tests. I got a high enough
score on the tests so that I
could take the GED. I had two
weeks to study for the test. At
first most of it is just
refreshing your memory. It
had been twelve years since
I'd been to school. Then
things got rougher academically
but I had this friend who
was my backbone. She would
help me when I got into a rut.
And with the help of Pam I
made it. She badgered me into
doing it.

Then I talked to the
counselor over at minimum
security and he showed me a
pamphlet by the University
Without Walls people who

~ program over at Metro
Heights College in Denver. I
was thinking of going to
Metro or Community College
but he told me about
scholarships for this program
so I applied. I got one of two
scholarships for women. I had
made it. It blew my mind. I
must have grinned for about a
week.

Things were happening to
me so fast. I was so full of
b.s. inside from the prison
that when this happened I felt
that I was really floating
around and it turns out to be
the best thing that ever
happened to me.

There is an inside team and
an outside team in the UWW
program. The inside team is
still in prison and the outside
team is people who are on
parole. So at the first session
of the whole program everybody
was together at Camp
George West which is in
Golden for classes. The other
woman who was in the
program and myself were
housed at Montview Girls’
School. I used to go back to
Montview at night with a
headache from absorbing so
much. I was learning at a rate
that I just couldn’t believe.

Since I grew up in the
streets I would respond
negatively and physically to
everything and everyone. Now
I was learning that I could
change things just by using
my head and that there were
resources available to me that
were dynamite and that gave
me the confidence that I
needed and the book learning
I needed.

When the session was over

and I had to go back to the
prison environment it was
really hard. The first time I
went to the prison I didn’t
know what was going on but
this time I did and it was so
hard for me and especially for
my family.

When I was back in the
structured environment one
thing that hit me was that if all
the inmates didn’t start
working together we wouldn’t
get anything done. Up until
now people were on a racial
trip. In the TV room the Blacks
would be together and the
Chicanas would be in a group
and the whites would stay
together. They would all
intermingle but it was an
obvious thing that they were
separate groups. So I became
aware (and so did some
others) that we were so busy
hassling each other that we
were going to stay in the same
rut.

Inmate Council

So some of us were elected
by the population to be in the
inmate council. At first we
wrote up a really formal thing
introducing ourselves to the
administration and trying to
get a better attitude going
between the guards and the
women inmates. The guards
tend to be really close-minded
to a lot of things - there is no
room for change with them.
They have set patterns they
stick to.

You start to act like a robot
here and before long you're
responding to buzzers to eat,
to sleep. That was basically
the rapport between the
administration and inmates.

So we started with menial
things, small rule changes
like being allowed to have
more clothes and picnics in
the yard. The associate
warden pretty mellow

came up with the idea for a
work-release program.

Everybody participated in
this proposal. I don’t think
that it ever happened before
that the whole prison popula-
tion participated in the same
thing and supported it and
really got behind it. Everyone
recognized the need. Espe-
cially the women who had
children and the women who
were federal prisoners who
were a long way from their
families or anybody who
could visit them.

The jobs that we had in the
prison were useless and
meaningless. You are just
working for the state making
shirts for the men in prison
and for patients at the state
hospitals. How much incen-
tive can a person get by
earning 15 to 40 cents a day?

We wrote up the proposal.
We had everything covered
down to where the partici-
pants would put their clothes
and what kind of transporta-
tion could be used. We
figured that the money we
made would be split up three
ways: one-third to the state
for our maintenance, one-third
to savings, and one-third
to the woman for her family.
We gave the proposal to May
Gillespie, the associate ward-
en. We gave her time to read it
(about two days) and waited
for an answer. We waited and
waited. We met with her but
she hadn’t read it yet. So we
waited another two weeks
and then hit her up with it
again. She had to say
something now. She said that
she was all for work-release
but that, you know, girls can
get pregnant. That was it. We
were stunned. I can’t recall
anyone’s expression because I
went into shock that she
would say that.

I think that for a long time
after that I thought “where's
this lady's head at?”

Gettin’ Out

The Inmate Council was
getting a lot of things together
and I applied for parole. I kind
of knew that if anybody had a
chance I did since I was
starting to get my head
together and responding to
things like the UWW program
and I don’t think that Ms.
Gillespie was comfortable
with that. To tell you the truth
I think that it scared the shit
out of her when she realized
that the inmate population
had a chance of getting it
together.

During that time I’m sure
she was under pressure
because the warden of the
prison had been suspended.
Oh that was the final reason
for no work-release program
because a permanent warden
hadn't been appointed. But
Alex Wilson has been the
warden for some time and I
still don’t see any work-re-
lease program for the women.

Anyway, I met with the
parole board on a Friday. It
usually takes about two weeks
to hear if you got it or not.
There's a lot of red tape to go
through and a lot of anxiety to
experience. But I got my
answer on Saturday the next
day and the board doesn’t
even work on Saturday. They
took me down to Canon City
to buy my clothes on that
Monday and on Tuesday I was

on my way to Denver. And,
what a coincidence, on the
next day (Wednesday) the
Grand Jury was down there to
talk to a lot of people. All I
know is that I would have had
a hell of a lot to say to them if
I would have been there.

When I got out it was really
a strange trip. I had been in
there 8½ months and my head
was pretty messed up. I love
my family very much and we
had always been close phy-
sically - hugging type people
and after I got out I would
really feel awkward every time
anyone would put their hands
on me. Sometimes I would
even pull away. I never
thought how important it is to
be able to touch somebody.

Right after I got out I started
school and I would be at the
school for an hour and then I'd
get this damndest insecure
feeling and I would have to go
home and sit there for a while.
There would be no reason for
this. I just needed to go home.
It took me a while to be able to
hug somebody and to be able
to let somebody kiss and hug
me or show some kind of
affection. I’m really glad that
I’m over that now.

It’s a good feeling to be able
to touch somebody. It’s part
of what we’re about - feeling
and loving and caring.

Thoughts From

Francis Howerton

We are trapped and weak
being consumed and set apart
from all other realities. One
may detect a sort of elated
atmosphere among us, but let
not your conceptions be
misdirected, my people: we
are restless and non-content
and merely exercising attri-
butes of our womanhood.

For we are the Queen
Mothers of this world, the
womb from which all civiliza-
tion emerged, and engulfed by
an ignorance so monstrous as
this system that the very
nature in which we were
created is denied us.

A temporary Women’s Center Council was chosen, made up of nine members--one from each of the six groups which were active organizing the festival, and three members to meet to make recommendations to the larger coalition on the following subjects: bylaws (or how decisions are made and by whom); statements of purpose (or what will the Women’s Center be and for whom); financial statements, incorporation, and criteria regarding who will be future members of the Women’s Center.  

An open meeting has been called for September 12, by which time the Council will present its reports to the coalition members, for discussion. The September 12 meeting will be held at 7:30 at the First Southern Baptist Church at 16th and Pearl.  

The groups which will be represented on a temporary council are: Rocky Mountain Women in the Arts, Herstory Theatre Group, Lesbian Task Force, Women in Transition, Big Mama Rag, and the Coalition Against Sexual Assault.  

A group for pre-orgasmic women is being formed beginning the third week of September. Call Jean Fortier at 831-7731, the Gestalt Institute for more information.  

Comments attributed to Dr. Carolyn Hursch in the August issue of Big Mama Rag were, in fact, made by the Public Relations Office of Denver General Hospital concerning Dr. Hursch’s research work and opinions. The Violence Research Unit is a division of Psychiatric Services at Denver General Hospital.
