If you're a woman and you have  
a degree in communications  
there are few opportunities  
open to you in a male-dominated  
broadcasting industry.  

What can you do to combat the  
inequities of the employment  
situation?  

One group of women in Denver  
have faced this problem by  
starting their own radio  
station. Begun by Yvonne  
Stith two months ago, the  

group ranges in age from 18  
to 65. Its chief goal is to  

offer employment to women who  

are in communications in the  
broadcasting field.  
The group plans on programming  

that includes a wide variety  

of music performed by women,  

consumer information and news  
that will

human interest

included.

to avoid the  
condescending approach of  
many actual producers of teen  
programs.  
The station will report on

So far they have  
more encouragement than  
opposition from the men in  

the broadcasting field and  
to measure public support  
they are conducting a telephone  
survey of this area.  

To raise money they are organizing a concert in the  
alley. They hope this will  
include many well-known female  
artists from all over  

the country. The funds from  
this project would be used  

to purchase a station. They  
need to raise enough for one  
year's operating expenses  

and a down payment on the  
station. They were officially  
incorporated on August 10,  

1977 as
