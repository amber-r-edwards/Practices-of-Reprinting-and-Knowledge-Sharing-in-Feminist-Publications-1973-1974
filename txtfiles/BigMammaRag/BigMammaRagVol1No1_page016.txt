BOOK REVIEW

THE BELL JAR

Emotional deterioration of the women
around her, the limited roles they
are confined to. She seeks something
different and is told that she must
become a super-woman, make herself
somehow different from “all those
other women" and yet still channel
her talents into a restricted mold.

SYLVIA PLATH died on a Monday morning
around 6:00 A.M. She went downstairs
into the kitchen and left

a plate of bread and butter and a
jug of milk for her children.

Then she opened the oven door,

turned on the gas, and laid her

head down.

Her book "The Bell Jar" is widely acclaimed now, and her two books of
poetry, "Colossus" and "Ariel" are
a common sight in all bookstores. 

Still - I wonder how many of her
readers have the power over her life that
will allow her to end the nightmare
that an analytical perceptive
realistic mind shows her daily.

She decides to commit suicide.
Suicide, the last attempt at self
determination, real control over one's
life, a desperate and liberating act.
She is thwarted in her attempt and
describes the hell she underwent in
being forcibly rehabilitated. Esther
was a rebel defeated, and one finds
herself wishing she had won the battle
then, rather than suffer the ten more
years of forced compliance Sylvia did
before she liberated herself from the

mornings began with the hope that
someone might understand, and how
many years of disappointment accumulated
in the process of her life.
Do not just read her book and say
you understand. For unless it
moves you beyond tears and into
some kind of action, your intro-
verted understanding will be of no
use. Do not read her poems and cry,
rather read them with the same anger
with which they were written. And
realize that unless things change,
or until we change things, I can
guarantee you that one of your
friends, my friends, our friends,

will surely do the same one day. The
"Bell Jar" is an autobiographical
novel written by Sylvia Plath about
herself in her 20th year of life. 

This young woman who gets slapped
in the face with the reality of
life and what happens to talented
women in our society. It is time to change the picture of reality
now and it was reality in the 50's. Sylvia, speaking through

Esther in the book, sees the
