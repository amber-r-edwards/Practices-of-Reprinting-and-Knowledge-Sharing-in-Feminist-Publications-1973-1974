of Vivien’s life and this relation to her work Here, I only attempt to give an impression of her poetry, hoping to stimulate those who read a little French, and perhaps to interest others in pushing for an English edition of these sisters who were saying seventy years ago what we are shouting now. And in some ways they said it better—speaking of beauty in beautiful words, they praised women without fear, without hangups, in verse of such sensual beauty as has not been equaled since Sappho laid down her pen. (I mean the French originals, of course, not my pitifully inadequate transliterations. After all, most of us know Sappho only through competent translations. Competent translations of at least Renée Vivien we must have!

Her English name was Pauline Tarn. All evidence points to an experience when Vivien was about seventeen. Her family had withdrawn her from happy school-life in Paris with her bosom-friend Violet to prepare her for the marriage market. Revolted by the prospect before her, Vivien poured out her emotions in letters to Violet. By all evidence her relationship with Violet—a very religious and mystical young girl—was completely innocent, but when Vivien's family intercepted these passionate letters they thought otherwise. A horrendous uproar of accusations, hate, and disgust seems to have followed, from which Vivien escaped only on becoming twenty-one, coming into her inheritance, and returning to Paris, free and wealthy in her own right.

Free at last, independently wealthy, Pauline Tarn returned to her beloved Paris, and soon acquired residences in Paris, Nice, and Mitylene, the first of which became legendary for its treasures of antique and oriental art, and to the end of her days she was an inveterate traveler, drunk with her new freedom...she found Violet too serious. Through her, however, she met Natalie Clifford Barney, who introduced her to Sappho. This double revelation: an intelligent woman whose talents, wealth, and sexual tastes matched her own, and a great classical poet who glorified these tastes—here was her “raison d'être,” her life purpose.

Soon after the beginning of her “new life,” perhaps as a symbol of her “pagan” (i.e. Ancient Greek) rebirth, she took the name under which she lived and wrote for the rest of her life: Renée Vivien. A common enough French name, surely, but it is interesting to note that renée means “re-born,” and that vivien has at least some etymological tie to vie (life) and vif, vive (alive, lively).

That at this time Vivien felt a sense of renewal and self-confidence in her newfound faith and pride in her socially despised experience is evident in two poems published in the same book as the one already quoted! (Poesies Completes, p. 152-55) The first, "Ainsi Je Parlerai" (what I would say), is a religious-philosophic fantasy concerning what one would say if the Last Judgment actually arrived, complete with a sympathetic and all-forgiving Jesus. What a temptation! (In that almost excessively moral era, almost everyone believed, really believed, and the worst sinners treasured the hope of a deathbed repentance and heaven's glory, for weren't they Christians, the chosen people? Hadn't Christ washed away all their sins if only they repented?)

Vivien has obviously no desire to repent. In "Ainsi Je Parlerai" she seems unaware of any sin at all. Although this complacent confidence does not survive unabated throughout her work, naturally enough, her sincerity and “liberation” at this time is conveyed in the innocent exaltation of her poems:

Ainsi Je Parlerai (what I would say)  
le Seigneur penchait son front sur mon trépas (if the Blessed Saviour came to my deathbed)  
Tui dirais: O Christ Je ne te connais pas. (I would say; Christ, I do not know you.)  
(Lord, your strict law has never been)  
Je vécus ainsi qu'un simple païen... (I lived as a simple pagan...)  
Le monde était autour de moi, tel un jardin. (the world was all around me just like a garden.)  
Je bus l'aube claire et le sol cristallin. (I drank the clear dawn and the crystalline twilight.)  
Le soleil me ceignait de ses plus vives flammes, (the sun girdled me round with his most eager fires,)  
Et l'amour m'incline vers la beauté des femmes. (and toward the beauty of women Love turned my desires.)  
Pardonne-moi, qui fus une simple païenne (so pardon me, who was a simple pagan!)  
Taisse-moi retourner vers Ta splendeur ancienne (Let me return to my ancient glory.)  
Et, puisque enfin l'instant éternel est venu, (and since at last the eternal moment has come,)  
Rejoindre celles-là qui n'ont point connu. (rejoin those who never could have known you.)

Vivien neither asks for forgiveness nor the hope of heaven; she would prefer instead to go to the pleasant, earthlike purgatory where the theology of the time placed those “good" pagans who had lived before the coming of Christ, and so had no chance to accept him. The particular pagans Vivien has in mind are clearly indicated by the use of the French pronoun celles-là in the last line. Sappho was perhaps not ‘on the list,’ so to speak, of good pagans at this particular time in history, but this specific feminine pronoun leaves no doubt as to which part of the ancient pagans she preferred—the splendor of the ancients to the joy of heaven.

The purpose of the Denver Sustaining Fund is to recycle to ourselves alternative institutions. Establish a procedure to financially sustain organizations which are serving the needs of poor people, working people, women, and minorities.

The desire is in us less strong than tenderness... (with us lust is less violent than tenderness, less powerful than touch)  
Et nos maîtresses ne sauraient nous décevoir, (and our lovers could never disappoint us, really.)  
Puisque c'est l'infini que nous aimons en elles... (because we seek perfection with them, and don't demand it from them...)  
Nos jours sans impudeur, sans crainte ni remords (our days, without shame, without fear or remorse)  
Se déroulent, ainsi que de larges accords, (unroll like mid-ocean waves; broad, calm, and deep,)  
Et nous nous aimons, comme ils aimaient à Mitylene. (and we love each other, like they loved at Mitylene.)

Dr. Foster says about this poem:  
"Far from being the mere defiant sacrilege this seemed to some readers, it was the confession of a new faith to replace the one in whose name England had damned her.” 

In an age of Faith—hypocritical or not—this is a remarkable poem. There is no guilt, no scent of sin, and Vivien‘s witty twist of conventional theology at the end is not only clever but daring.

Vivien established a villa at Mitylene, and became for a time the dedicated priestess of the new “Golden Age.” The following lines from "Les Plaisirs" show her self-confidence and liberated spirit at this time. This was in fact the most "right-on" period of her life, before health, unwise love affairs, and false friends had time to tarnish the Golden Ideal. Commonly enough, her best poetry was yet to come. But the poetry of pain, of disillusion, in other words the work of maturity (yet she died at thirty-two!) is, while it may be better poetry than these "Youthful Pieces," beyond the scope of this article.

I do intend, however, to follow Renée Vivien on my own as far as the Denver area's limited facilities permit. Anyone who has ever heard of these women—even a name in an index or a line in a book—should write Barbara Kline, c/o The Lesbian Center, Women in Transition House, 1895 Lafayette St., Denver.

Surely the time is now for an edition of her works in English (preferably Bi-Lingual) for a poet of whom Reinach wrote the following...  
"I could quote from these volumes at least two hundred verses which rank among the finest specimens of French poetry... I am aware that there are some objectionable elements...but her genius—for genius she had—is the more extraordinary as she wrote in a language not her own. I feel sure she will be famous someday, and think it desirable that we should try to know more about her before it gets too late.” 

Dr. Foster goes on to say:  
“All the critics who grant her this superlative poetic quality agree that she has received nothing approaching her due recognition because of the lesbian element in her work. In view of the small number of persons in any generation who are tolerant of such love, it may be that she will never receive it.” 

All I can hope is that women and lesbians remain fashionable and “in” long enough to become, at least momentarily, a popular subject for scholarship, so that universities have the money and facilities to dig up the primary texts and get them into print. Once our lost literature is available in print, it's up to us. If Sappho Was a Lesbian Woman (no insult intended—it's a fine book, but strictly contemporary movement literature, not Belle Lettres) satisfies your needs, that’s fine. But this is our culture; it's been hidden from us; it's been simply neglected; it will soon be lost forever to us, our successors, our children. You don't ever have to actually read this stuff if you don’t want to. There will always be crazy women wild to study, and always, the humanity and need it to you from. Now before you get offended, remember High School Lit... Remember Dickinson and Herman Melville, remember Julius Caesar or whichever bored you most. Starlet penne? Hiss Magner? I'm not saying it would be any better, would be refreshing to hear; it's just too dull! If you can't read it, don't! Nonsense! Bullshit, that's all.

Denver Sustaining Fund

The money for this fund will come from two sources: a voluntary tax on items people purchase from various businesses which are participating in the fund (the community chain) and from individuals pledging a certain amount of their weekly paychecks (the community cache).

A board of directors has been established which receives money based on continued support from the community.
