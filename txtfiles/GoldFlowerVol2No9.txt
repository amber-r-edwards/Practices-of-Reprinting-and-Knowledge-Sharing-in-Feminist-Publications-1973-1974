Competition Sickness” Pervades -- - -  
Legal Education  
Will Women Humanize  
by Jane Prohaska  

Rumor has it that the following exchange  
took place at that most prestigious center  
of legal education, Harvard Law School:  

Professor: Miss Smith, will you please  
state the holding of the case assigned  
for today?  

Woman Student: I would prefer to be called  
"Ms." from now on.  

Professor: Miss Smith, I will call you  
damn broads anything I choose, if I  
choose to call on you at all.  

Whether or not this accurately represents  
the status of women at Harvard Law, I cannot  
say. If such were representative of the  
University of Minnesota where I am a first  
year law student, making the usual indict-  
ments of sex discrimination would be all too  
easy. However, the situation here is a com-  
plex one due to certain concessions already  
made by the University law school, due to  
the women law students themselves, and most  
of all, due to the structure of legal educa-  
tion and the legal profession itself.  

First of all, it is important to realize  
being a first year law student - male  
or female - is an overwhelming situation.  

My first reaction when asked if I would be  
interested in writing about women and law  
school was that I couldn't possibly find  
time. After all, my first final exams are  
only ten weeks away. The object of law  
school, as I view it, is to keep you so busy  
studying and so confused about the materials  
you are studying that you have no time at  
all to reflect on the situation thrust upon  
you. For not only was I too busy to write  
this article, but I didn't have the proper  
perspective. I am merely a confused first  
year student and don't yet understand the  
workings of the legal field. This evalua-  
tion of law school as it relates to women is  
highly prejudicial, as is any individual's  
critique of an institution with which they  
are not fully satisfied, but I do not be-  
lieve that makes it invalid.  

Not Blatant  

I have never been faced with a situation  
such as the Harvard anecdote. In fact, I  
have not run across blatant institutional  
discrimination at the law school at all. The  
admissions committee has made fairly impres-  
sive moves with women comprising 20% of my  
class, or about 50 of 250 students. This  
is remarkable only when considering that  
in the third year class of the same size  
there are less than 20 women.  

Since all of my classes consist of first  
year students, women do not seem out of  
place. They are not noticeable; they belong  
as much as any other student. Women are not  
singled out for abuse or neglect during  
class discussions, as I have been told they  
had in the past.  

It is assumed in law school that all stu-  
dents have only surnames and this uniform  
policy has led to some confusion for pro-  
fessors who wonder how to refer to women.  

Law School ?  

Most have resorted to "Miss" despite the  
fact that a large number are married. One  
professor went to great pains to explain  
to us that he really would like to call us  
"Ms." but the other was so ingrained that  
he used it unconsciously. He sincerely  
apologized if anyone was offended. As a  
sort of compromise he merely points at vol-  
unteers and says "Ma'am?" There have been  
no confrontations so the name remains uncon-  
tested.  

There are still problems. There is only  
one woman on the teaching faculty, although  
attempts are being made to secure one or two  
more for next year. The problem, as explained  
by one faculty member, is that competent  
women law professors are in such demand that  
they are hard to come by. Using competent  
women lawyers on a part-time basis has not  
been an alternative I've heard under discus-  
sion.  

In the area of placement, there is a great  
deal to be done. Interviewing firms don't  
ask men if they intend to have a family.  

Nor do they tell them that in front of a  
jury with a majority of women, their case  
won't stand a chance, especially if they are  
attractive. But the placement office is  
working with women to find out what their  
major complaints are so that these can be  
collectively expressed to interviewers to  
help further their enlightenment.  

“I Wouldn’t Want to Marry One”  
The social atmosphere in the law school is  
a somewhat different situation. Academically,  
women are well-respected by male stu-  
dents, or perhaps feared because they do  
better percentage-wise than their male  
counterparts. One male second year student  
was particularly pleased with me because  
upon exchanging law board scores - a con-  
stant pastime many law students engage in  
to reassure themselves that they are more  
intelligent than the next - he “finally dis-

covered a girl who has lower scores than I  
do." There is not disdain for the brighter  
women - merely an attitude of "I wouldn't  
want to marry one."  

There is a sort of fraternity atmosphere  
around the law school, complete with foot-  
ball pools and poker games. In fact, there  
is an actual law fraternity with "Mixers"  
with undergraduate sororities so "the guys  
in the house can get to meet some girls."  
Signs advertising such an event read "Law  
Students $1.50; Girls 50¢." In an attempt  
to remedy this inadvertent error - as it was  
explained to me - the word "male" was inser-  
ted after "Law Students."  

To be fair to the law fraternity, though,  
while it houses only men at the present time  
I was told by the president that any woman  
who wanted could move in. It strikes me as  
not in the least surprising that no one has  
yet jumped at the opportunity.  

Of course, it is not fair to let the as-  
sumption be made that all men in law school  
share the above outlook on life. The truth  
is that most law students ignore the whole  
issue and just keep on studying.  

My real dissatisfaction with law school is  
not so much based on the personal attitudes  
of my "colleagues" or the gaps in the insti-  
tutional attempts to promote equal treatment  
of men and women. In fact, my discontent has  

but with the basic attitudes, pressures, and  
practices of law school which affect all  
students and with the lack of any collective  
effort by women to counteract these tradi-  
tions of legal education.  

Humiliation & Razor Blades  

I have already commented on the amount of  
time consumed in study.  
that there is a large amount of work to  
be done, but that there is the constant feel-  
ing that no matter how much you do, you  
should be doing more. I cannot pinpoint the  
source of the pressure - much of it is from  
the teaching technique of randomly calling  
on students in class and questioning an in-  
dividual until confusion reigns supreme. The  
result is that students must constantly over  
prepare to avoid total humiliation should  
they be the victim of the day.  

A great deal of pressure comes from the  
students themselves. The fierce sense of  
competitiveness that prevails is frighten-  
ing. Books disappear, articles are razor-  
bladed from journals - not because a student  
needs such materials - but in order to keep  
other students from using them and possibly  
getting better grades. For after all, bet-  
ter grades, better jobs, and more money is  
the point of all this, is it not?  

Cooperation sometimes exists, but the  
school's honor code prohibits it, even  
while doing research. For cooperation works  
against the grain of the adversary system -  
a system based on two people taking opposite  
sides of an issue, each arguing one side of  
the issue to its logical/illogical extreme  
and then, somehow in the process, "justice  
will be achieved."  

My hope for the women's movement at large  
is that not only will it help to raise the  
level of consciousness and remove inequality  
but that it will also help remold the opera-  
tion of those institutions in which women  
are demanding equal acceptance.  

Caucus & Competition  

This is unfortunately not the case at the  
University of Minnesota law school.  

There is a caucus of Law Women which has  
developed programs to encourage women to  
attend law school, brought feminist speakers  

nothing to do with sex discrimination at all,  

It is not so  

to campus, and even purchased a subscription  
to MS magazine for the library. But so far,  
the Women's Caucus has been unable to produce a  
spirit of cooperation, even among women,  
which might begin to counterbalance the com-  
petitive emphasis faced by all of us. What  
really bothers me is that the women at the  
law school are every bit as competitive as  
the men. And no one seems to have the time  
to contemplate change.  

The reasons are not obvious, but they are  
easy to understand. In the past, women in  
law have had to work much harder than men  
to receive equal recognition, and somehow,  
once they have received that recognition, it  
is easy for them to forget the means by  
which they had achieved it. At the present,  
a number of women at law school have made  
careful and deliberate decisions to enter  
the legal profession and they are highly  
goal oriented. Doing a good job in their  
chosen field is more important than attempt-  
ing to reform the process. Similarly, a  
number of married women with children have  
a hard enough time carving out the time  
necessary to study without contemplating  
change.  

In addition, the fact that the administra-  
tion at the law school has taken the steps  
it has in some of the major issues means  
that there are no well-defined causes or  
grievances around which women might rally  
together. Without such a base, it is much  
more difficult to form a cohesive group to  
fight the more pervading atmosphere of law  
school itself.  

I do not mean any of this as a condemna-  
tion of women in law school, and I certainly  
cannot exempt myself from the syndromes I  
have explained. Many of the women I meet  
are very strong individuals who are quite  
used to achieving on their own,  

common practice base, even if it were to  
concern itself with changing the style of  
legal education. Many are quite content  
with the status quo, but a great number of  
men are also upset with the excessive empha-  
sis on competition.  

Women have gained much through legal chan-  
nels in establishing their rights. And  
within its own structure, women are gaining  
status in the legal world. But these accom-  
plishments and the concrete increase in the  
number of women law students should not lead  
women to think that all is over and we are  
on our way.

Women Boycotting

Two local food cooperatives,  
the Southeast Community Store  
and the Selby Food Coop, have  
joined the Twin Cities chap-  
ters of the National Organiza-  
tion for Women in boycotting  
products of Land-O'-Lakes, a  
grocery supplier and owner of  
Bridgeman's stores. NOW al-  
leges that Land-O'-Lakes dis-  
criminates against women and  
minority men in hiring, pay,  
and promotion practices.  

In February the local NOW  
chapters will attend the na-  
tional NOW meeting and re-  
quest that the national organ-  
ization participate in the  
selective buying campaign.  

NOW has also filed a com-  
plaint of sexual and racial  

Dare To Rebel  

Sex discrimination is ille-  
gal. Women are taking legal  
action against employers in  
increasing numbers with in-  
creasing success.  

But the women who filed the  
first sex discrimination suits  
took big risks—from being  
fired to being labeled a  
troublemaker, an anathema  
to prospective employers.  

Ellen Dresselhuis, Minnea-  
polis attorney and active  
member of the Women's Equity  
Action League, handles many  
of the city's sex discrimina-  
tion suits. She admires the  
women who "really stuck their  
necks out" by undertaking the  
slow, costly process of pro-  
secuting a suit.  

But now, explains Dressel-  
huis, there is a new, effec-  
tive tool which protects the  
individual seeking equal pay.  
Under Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act and other provi-  
sions, suits can be filed by  
organizations on behalf of an  
individual who can remain an-  
onymous and protected from  

discrimination with the E-  
qual Employment Opportunity  
Commission. There is an o-  
verwhelming backlog of cases  
to be investigated, but even-  
tually the Commission will  
assign an investigator to  
make a thorough study of the  
company's practices.  

Two NOW members met with  
Land-O'-Lakes representa-  
tives last fall as part of  
a survey of Twin Cities em-  
ployment practices. One mem-  
ber said the company repre-  
sentatives expected them to  
"sit there like little la-  
dies," telling them only  
what they wanted them to hear.  
When the NOW members began  
asking questions, the  
company reps acted "insulted  
and embarrassed."  

"We knew some of the women  
who had been working there  
and heard their stories,"  
said one NOW member, and the  
picture the company painted  
"just didn't connect right."  

NOW members say women often  
receive unequal pay for equal  
work, while minority employ-  
ees of either sex are almost  
non-existent in the company.  

When a former employee  

A former employee told NOW  
that she had been doing the  
same work as a man for less

retaliatory action. Organi-  

zations like the Equal Employ-  
ment Opportunities Commission  
which formerly had only con-  

ciliatory powers, can now sue  
offending businesses.  

Unequal pay and unfair hir-  
ing practices have been cost-  
ly for the men and women who  
lost out in the past. Now  
business is beginning to re-  
alize the costs of sex dis-  
crimination. Losing court  
cases is costly but not near-  
ly as costly as under-utiliz-  
ing the talents of all the  
people they employ.  

When will businesses alter  
their behavior? "When it  
starts costing them money,"  
says Dresselhuis. "Discrim-  
ination is just not good bus-  
iness practice."  

With more companies paying  
attorney's fees and fines,  
sex discrimination suits are  
increasingly effective in  
changing business's treatment  
of women and minorities. Af-

A NOW member from Iowa vis-  
ited a Land-O'-Lakes plant in  
southern Minnesota and tour-  
ed a production line. She  
asked the male supervisor why  
all the production workers  
were women, and he said, "On-  
ly women would work for these  
low wages."  

The company took repress-  
ive measures against women  
who dared rebel. For example,  
some of the clerical workers  
tried to form a union. The  
company president sent a let-  
ter to clerical employees  
questioning the need for such  
a union, since the company  
"does so well for its employ-  
ees."  

At times the management has  
used gangster movie tactics  
in its fight to maintain the  
status quo. At one point a  
corporate secretary attended  
a clerical union meeting to  
"spy"; she took notes and  
made a full report to manage-  
ment.  

Even the Land-O'-Lakes sym-  

bol, an Indian woman, is an  
unwitting reminder of the  
company's discrimination:  
there are no Indian women on  
the Board of Directors or in  
top management at Land-O'-  
Lakes.

REIDELL  

es the threat of a discrimin-  
ation suit will have more im-  
pact according to Dresselhuis.  

Most of those who are fil-  
ing suits are women who are  
supporting themselves and  
their families or those who  
are recently divorced and  
living on their own. “They  
are most aware of the pro-  
blems," Dresselhuis explains.  
But the real changes have to  
come for the average woman  
with a high school diploma  
and those women who are "a  
heartbeat away from welfare."  

Equality in employment will  
come, says Dresselhuis, "the  
day the average woman can  
make as much as the average  
man."  

She says the woman who is  
willing to be underutilized  
is as responsible for keep-  
ing women down as the boss  
who doesn't promote her. "We  
women have to be alert and un-  
derstand that they are enti-  
tled to be recognized for  
their abilities."

Lesbian Separatism--  
A Straight View  

Dear Sisters:  

I am writing in response  
to some real concern I felt  
and still feel about certain  
political views expressed at  
The Season of the Witch--  
namely--"Lesbian Separatism."  
It's not that I hadn't been  
exposed to it before or hadn't  
been in groups that dealt with  
it before, but I  

think hearing the ideas so  
strongly presented at the  
same time we were feeling  
such pride and sisterhood  
and power threw me off bal-  
ance and I still feel the  
need to share my feelings  
with my sisters.  

In order to identify my  
concern, I guess I need to  
state that I have no objec-  
tion to a separatist philoso-  
phy that removes gay women  
from association with men. I  
have no objection to a separ-  
atist philosophy that encour-  
ages gay women to occasional-  
ly withdraw from straight wo-  
men to gain strength and sup-  
port from each other. But I  
do object to a separatist  
philosophy that completely  
withdraws from straight wom-  
en as a matter of political  
principle and further casts  
straight women into the role  
of collaborator and states  
that straight women aren't  
honest in their politics.  

I guess what's moving me to  
write is fear. I see too  
many of my sisters steering  
themselves toward something I  
was raised in--namely a reac-  
tionary fundamentalism that  
refuses to allow anyone else  
their portion of truth.  

It's not that I can't under-  
stand the idea of complete  
separatism. The logical, al-  
most mathematically precise,  
extension of the feminist  
movement, given the present  
patriarchal capitalistic sys-  
tem we live in, is separatism  

(with, hopefully, some way  
to achieve spontaneous gen-  
eration.)  

But I am not yet persuaded  
that the reason for men's  
differences is solely physi-  
cal in origin and not more  
sociologically and psycho-  
logically based. If the pro-  
blems are caused by physio-  
logical differences then we  

can have no hope and I will  
end my letter here and be-  
come celibate. But if, as I  
suspect, the problems lie in  
programming and conditioning  
then the problems can be o-  
vercome by education and con-  
ditioning of a different na-  
ture. This generation of  
men and probably the next  
several generations are ir-  
revocably lost. It's the  
future generations who can  
be liberated from the kinds  
of roles men have created  
for themselves and for us.  

If you choose to separate  
yourselves from this genera-  
tion of men I see that as a  
legitimate choice and I do  
not quarrel with it.  

But I am tired of seeing  
women who are working for fu-  
ture generations cast in the  
roles of oppressors them-  
selves or at best as colla-  
borators because they don't  
fit into what is to you an  
acceptable mold.  

I am also tired of sarcas-  
tic remarks about trying to  
find "The Exceptional Man."  
Let me put it on the record  
right now--there is no such  
thing as an exceptional man.  
They are all too bound up in  
their own conditioning. At  
best, what a man can be right  
now is someone who knows what  
is--an oppressor--and doesn't  
like it. At best, what a man  
can be right now is someone  
who will admit he is confused  
and threatened by women but  
wants to keep the lines open  
for an attempt at compassion  
and hopefully love. At best,  
what a man can be right now  
is someone who will try not  
to say--"I understand," be-  
cause he knows he never can.  
This is the best a man can be  
right now; but exceptional--  
no way! So let me call off  
the search for this mythical  
beast.  

I'm not into devoting my  
energies to changing today's  
man either. That's his own  
job if it can be done. I  
guess my hope is for our sons  
and daughters to live as per-  
sons, not role players.  

Why do I live with a man  
then? The purpose of this  
letter is not to give apolo-  
gies for my own lifestyle so  
an explanation as such will  
not be given beyond this:  
the relationship we have is  
based on our common humanity.  
I refuse to devote my ener-  
gies to fighting roles in  

this relationship and that  
is well understood. And, as  
you are probably discovering,  
once roles are removed the  
possibility for a relation-  
ship based on human values  
can be realized. Further, I  
refuse to deny my own sexual  
preferences just as I support  
my gay sisters in their re-  
fusal to deny theirs.  

You may ask why I even con-  
cern myself with this ques-  
tion then. Why don't I just  
ignore the whole issue? I  
guess the love I felt for all  
my sisters in that room dur-  
ing The Season of the Witch  
is part of the reason I re-  
fuse to ignore it. I refuse  
to remove myself from any of  
my sisters who are struggling  
against oppression. If a se-  
paration occurs, it will be  
my gay sisters who will ini-  
tiate it. And the more I  
read, the more conferences I  
attend, the more workshops  
etc. I sit through, the more  
I realize that such a split  

is becoming inevitable.  

It may be understandable  
but I have always felt, I  
felt that night, and I will  
always feel that we are wom-  
en--sisters truly--and all in  
this struggle together. We  
need each other. Any denial  
of our commonality hurts us  
all and drains power from the  
whole of the body of woman.  
That lost power doesn't drain  
off to any of the segments  
either. It drains from us  
directly to our oppressors.  

I guess the most painful  
outcome of this split will be  
the loss of too many real  
friends. That kind of loss  
leaves holes and I don't want  
that to happen.  

But if it does happen; if  
you must go to the Lesbian  
nation; if you must remove  
your support from me and re-  
fuse to take my support, then  
at least drop me a postcard  
now and then. Because I need  
you and I love you.

was mentioned as having more
applications than it can han
dle. C.E.A. operates at a
limited capacity because:

1) Small classes facili-
tate personal conduct be-
tween students, instructors,
and teaching assistants.

2) Small classes encour-
age active participation of
all the people in the class.
CEA never turns away anyone
seeking preparation for child
birth, unless all eleven lo-
cations are at capacity. The
screeners who register people
by telephone try to offer
several options as to what
location, time, and series a
person wants to attend. We
now plan to offer approximately
100 series in 1974, with
an active teaching staff of
23 instructors and hundreds of
teaching assistants, and a
support system of volunteers
from the community.

We welcome all pregnant wo-
men to give CEA a call, and
learn about what we offer in
education and training for
childbirth.

I personally am very excit-
ed about the growing field of
Midwifery; this will offer a
real choice to all women.

Clinic Regroups

Now that it's midwinter we
have found that our way to
achieve our goals needed some
changing. Within the last
few weeks, through hours of
discussion, we have come to
some new conclusions. We
would like to establish a wo-
men's health center for edu-
cation, self-help, counseling
and discovery. This is a
change from what we have
struggled to become for the
last 9 months.

Our goals, as a refresher, 

are still the same. They are
grand and glorious, and yet
we have hope that we can
start to tackle them. We
wish to change the way health
care is delivered by consumer
control, alleviating the hier-
archical structure of health
care workers, undermining the
drug companies' power, giving
women knowledge and control
of their bodies! (How about
that!)

In the past we felt that if
we opened a clinic we could
be an example of how these
changes could affect delivery
of health care. But after
many long hours of discussion
we felt that to do x-amount
of Pap and x-amount of VD
cultures we would end up
draining all our energies
just on service. There are
a lot of facilities that peo-
ple can use, granted none are
giving "good" service. But
by using our energies to put
the education of women and
health care workers on top of
our list we feel we might
accomplish more (to change
existing service for all wo-
men).

So the Center now has a pro-
gram which started with our
education. We have broken
ourselves up into five major
work groups. Each group
takes its own responsibility
for one facet of the center.
They are as listed:

Funding--a never-ending pro-
blem. The group is busy
learning new language and
writing an “in-house" purpo-
sal. We also have a video
tape to use at the funding
boards. Any ideas for places
to go would be appreciated.

Classes--We would like to
offer classes, probably 5
sessions at the Health Center
on women's health.

We start our first health
class February 6 at 7:30.
There will be a fee, as yet
unknown. This is an intro-
duction and a general class
on health and women. From
this class we hope people
will go into collective study
groups on individual smaller
topics. We feel this class
will give a broad base for
women to continue to learn
from. The class topics are
as follows:

1) feminism and politics

2) anatomy and self-help

3) hormone system and men-
opause

4) birth control and abor-
tion

5) VD and vaginal infec-
tions

6) sexuality

7) birth and children

8) health care issues

9) preventive medicine and
Eastern medicine

We want to limit the class
to 15 women and hope that
people will attend all nine.
If the registration is high
we will start a second class
on Tuesday at 7:30. All classes
at 2000 South 5th St, the
People’s Center.

Introduction and Speaking
Gigs. We hope to do a lot of
speaking gigs and do some
teaching on self-help. Any
group can call and ask for
this.

Each Wednesday night there
is an open-ended introduction
session about the Center, fem-
inism, and an opportunity to
learn self-help. The direc-
tion of these discussions
will be determined by the
needs and feelings of the in-
dividual women present.
Please come and see what we
have to offer.

Counseling--There will be
counselors trained for coun-
seling or for referral. Op-
portunities for referral are:

1) health classes

2) an open-ended support
group

3) women's rap groups

4) counselors with a fem-
inist perspective will
be available for long-
term counseling.

Evaluation--As a feminist
group we feel the need to
also evaluate what we do, and
how we accomplish our objec-
tives. The group is develop-
ing a framework within which
we can evaluate ourselves.

We believe it is necessary
to have a structure which
still allows us to be human
and free. We hope this is
informative and lets you know
where we are at. If you want
any further information please
contact us. Someone
is at the Center all day M-F.

Women Poets:

Seeking Community,  
Exploring New Sensibility  

Collecting information on the Women Poets  
of the Twin Cities, I felt like the prover-  
bial blind men trying to understand an ele-  
phant by touch. It is a writer's workshop,  
I exclaimed, grabbing at one end. It's a  
feminist consciousness raising group, I  
thought, checking out another part. It  
exists to sponsor readings. No, its pur-  
pose is to establish critical standards.  
Each time I explored another aspect of the  
Women Poets of the Twin Cities, it seemed a  
different organization—and the whole makes  
up quite as unlikely an animal as that pro-  
verbial elephant.  

Undefinable and All-Embracing  

The Women Poets themselves are as undefi-  
nable as their organization. Looking at  
Phebe Hanson, one sees a Woman Poet to be a  
fortyish professional woman and mother who  
began writing recently after a long silence.  
But then, a Woman Poet seems to be academi-  
cally trained, published in literary maga-  
zines and involved in Minnesota publishing  
ventures, like Jenne Andrews. Or a faculty  
wife and mother long active in local liter-  
ary activities (like Beryle Williams), or  
a dedicated and experienced public reader  
(like Mary Ellen Shaw) or a college drop-  
out and former resistance worker (like Mary  
Pat Flandrick). Or some 30 other possibili-  
ties, one for each member of this amorphous  
organization.  

The Women Poets themselves are perhaps  
best described by the continuums upon which  
they fall: from teen-aged to middle-aged,  
from counterculture to middle-class, from  
gay to straight, from politically radical to  
moderate, from just embarking on a literary  
career to semi-established. Their rather an-  
archic organization slides across other con-  
tinuums, from private to public, from per-  
sonal to political, from poetic to polemical.  

The generic name is a symbol of the in-  
clusiveness and diversity of the group: to  
be a Woman Poet of the Twin Cities is to be  
just that. Patricia Hampl, who's too busy to  
attend meetings, still feels part of the  
group, saying, "I'm a woman writing poetry  
in St. Paul. By definition I'm a Woman Poet  
of the Twin Cities." There are active members  
and inactive members, and members who haven't  
yet joined.  

by Pat Monaghan  

Invisible Women Poets  

Doubtless, two years ago there were women  
poets in the Twin Cities. There were numer-  
ous poetry readings and a burgeoning sense  
of literary community. But women were rare  
on the platform and in local publications.  
They were excluded from speaking at poetry  
seminars and other educational events, or  
represented by a token few. There were  
women poets here, but no one knew how many,  
or who they were.  

Then at a reading featuring men poets,  
Penny Seuss abruptly turned to Beryle Willi  
ams and demanded, "If I have a reading, will  
you read?" Four women organized the first  
reading, held in November, 1971, that drew  
what Williams calls "a devoted audience."  

"We organized because we weren't hearing  
any women's poetry, and weren't getting ac-  
quainted in private ways,” Williams explain-  
ed. "It grew out of our need. We needed to  
write and share and have it heard."  

An open reading at the end of the program  
brought more women poets into evidence. A  
meeting soon after brought out even more,  
and the Women Poets of the Twin Cities (WP-  
TC) was launched.  

Some of the women are harsh on the poetic  
establishment that drove them to organize a  
separate group. "Men were turning poetry  
readings into wakes,” grimaces Flandrick.  
"Now, wakes can be very moving. But I want  
to go to poetry readings and find poets who  
excite me."  

Shaw, who organized the first meeting of  
the WPTC, deplores "the club of poets who  
were reading private jokes and disserta-  
tions." She remembers the "exciting vision"  
that led to the organization of the Women  
Poets. "We felt we could be a great new  
force in literature, writing not against but  
for each other. We felt that we could build  
a community of artists. We wanted to write  
closer to the life of people and to our own  
life, to speak to an audience that had been  
turned off by poetry. We felt that we could  
change the ideas of women and their lives."

Since its formation, WPTC has held more-or
less weekly meetings, at which any of a va-
riety of activities can take place. Some-
times the evening is devoted to considering
the work of a major woman poet, sometimes

to a visit with poets of the reputation of
Diane Di Prima or Eve Merriam. There are
intensive individual critiques of the work
of individual members. There are open read-
ings, each poet presenting her latest work.
And sometimes WPTC holds business meetings
to plan an upcoming public reading and other
projects.

WPTC -- Public and Private

Shaw calls the group "organized anarchy,"
while Hanson suggests the milder term "re-
latively unstructured organization." Leader-
ship is fluid. "The leadership is passed
from one to another for brief periods. Any-
one who happens to have a project in mind is
leader for the moment," Hansen explains.

For a group which has no formal structure
--"We'll never be a 'proper' organization,"
laughs Hanson--WPTC has sponsored a remark-
able number of activities: six large-scale
public readings, 15 smaller readings at
such places as the St. Paul Open School and
Stillwater State Prison, a dozen mixed
readings in which women poets participated,
and six chapbooks featuring women poets. An
anthology is in progress.

Public activities reveal only one side
of the group's purpose, for WPTC functions
as much as a support group and critical
workshop as it does as a voice for women's
literary rights. This duality of function is
reflected in the different attitudes WPTC
members have about the organization, and
about their work. "Some of us are primarily
concerned with writing; our primary aim is
to be as professional as possible," says
Shaw. “For others, the writing is tangential
to political aspirations of liberating wo-
men." “Everyone comes to the group with dif-
ferent needs and expectations," Flandrick
explains.

Despite this, WPTC attempts to support
each woman's struggle to define an artistic
identity. For some, such support is a heady
experience. "I still feel like I'm giving
religious testimony when I talk about the
group," says Hanson. "Starting to think
about myself as a serious poet was an ec-
static experience. At first I was so fragile
and it was so scary. The Women Poets have
made me feel that what I have to say is im-
portant, that my experiences, however li-
mited, are valuable. It took me 25 years to
find that out." Women, Hanson claims, are
conditioned "to put ourselves and our own
experiences down. I remember, not long ago,
half-apologizing to a man for liking Joan
Didion."

Public and private activities merge, Wil-
liams feels, in the growing public aware-
ness of WPTC and of its members. "You never
heard of us as individuals. We have each
gained more public notice than we would have
without this group."

In addition to offering encouragement,
the group attempts to provide critical
analysis for the emerging poets. A problem
arises, however, in determining what stand-
ards to apply. Some women poets feel their
work has been judged by male standards, that
their unique vision has not been valued.

POETRY

"You can open your pants in public view,
but don't open the kitchen door,” snorts
Williams.

While Hanson denounces male critics for
being "not tuned in to female sensibility,"
she admits another problem, that "women
don't generally have the ego-strength of men
and are more vulnerable to criticism"--for
which reason the group restricts its mem-
bership to women. Shaw elaborates: "We
felt that with only women, we'd work on a
sharing human basis; just because we're wo-
men. Well, it works and it doesn't work.
Right now it's the closest thing to an artis-
tic community there is here."

Flandrick describes it another way. "Most
women I know are just working on becoming
self-centered--that's different, you know,
from being selfish. I used to buy the myth-
ology of artist-as-neurotic, of having to
transcend the ego. Well, women for the most
part don't have an ego to transcend. If
poetry is going to be saved, it's going to
be the women that save it."

Although the Women Poets profess to reject
male poetic sensibility, they have not yet
defined an alternative. "We've never evolved
a standard," Shaw says. "But I notice that
even when women write angry poems, there is
an element of tenderness, of sorrow," Wil-
liams sees women as "less myopic, more out
of the ego bubble, than men.

"What we do know," she sums up, "now that
we're hearing enough of women's poetry, is
that it is a different body than men's
poetry, and that some of it is vital, and
some is not."

Aftermath of a Sex Discrimination Charge

Opting

EMMA  
GOLDMAN

Conclusion

NOTE TO READERS: The

author was, until recently,  
employed by a Twin Cities  
firm. In May 1972 she filed  
a sex discrimination charge  
against the corporation with  
the Minnesota Department of  
Human Rights. Subsequently,  
she also filed a charge of  
race and sex discrimination  
against the corporation with  
the federal Equal Employment  
Opportunities Commission  
(EEOC).

PART I of this series out-  
lined events leading up to  
the filing of a sex dis-  
crimination charge, the fil-  
ing procedure and the con-  
frontation of the author  

and her supervisor after he  
was served with the charge.

PART II detailed the auth-  
or's relationship with her  
employer after she filed  

the charge and outlined some  
of the pitfalls a woman can  
encounter in a sex discrim-  
ination case.

PART III concludes the  
series.

Out?

A writer should never plan  
a three-part series on any-  
thing. Facing the conclus-  
ion of this story, I find  
that my blood has cooled sig-  
nificantly and ennui has  

set in. After some thought,  
however, I conclude that a  
paler mood is appropriate  

to the last segment of my  
story on sex discrimination  
in employment.

Cooled ardor allows me  
some perspective.

As I noted in PART II, my  
employer quickly removed its  
hand from the velvet glove  
when I proved intractable  

and would not drop my charge.  
The company then began its  
series of time-wasting maneu-  
vers to keep me occupied  
charting my "career path" and  
stating job objectives while  
the Personnel Department  

ne. my.aec-

tion.

I filed my charge in May  
1972. By August I realized  
an attorney was necessary. I  
retained a Twin Cities att-  
orney experienced in dis-  
crimination cases.

Together we reviewed my  
case and awaited the outcome  
of the Department of Human  
Rights' investigation. In  
November 1972 the Commission-  
er of Human Rights delivered  
a decision—"no probable  
cause" to assume that my em-  
ployer had discriminated a-  
gainst me, and by extrapol-  
ation, against women as a  
class.

I was unhappy but not sur-  
prised. After some hesita-  
tion, I met with my attorney  
and together we planned an  
appeal to the State Appeal  
Board.

In January 1973 my attorn-  
ey and I faced representa-  
tives of my employer at a  
Board hearing. I felt at  
the hearing that we made our  
point. My employer's agents  
found that slick phrases and  
expensive clothing were in-  
adequate defenses against my  
charges.

In April 1973 I was noti-  
fied that the Appeal Board  
had reversed the Commission-  

by Mary Hastings

er's finding and sent my  
case "back for reinvestiga-  
tion."

At this writing, the "re-  

investigation" has been com-  
pleted and I await the Appeal  
Board's further action in the  
matter.

In the interim, however,  
the laws governing filing of  
sex discrimination charges  
have been changed. (See  
February "Gold Flower" for  
article on changes in the  
law.) According to a Depart-  
ment attorney, the Appeal  
Board no longer has the final  
word in sex discrimination  
cases. The Board may rule,  
but the case must then return  
to the State Department of  
Human Rights for final dis-  
position.

One of the most frustrating  
elements—experience  

has been the very confusing and  
seemingly complicated proced-  
ures the Minnesota Department  
of Human Rights follows in  
investigating a sex discrim-  
ination charge. Any woman con-  
templating filing a charge  
should be prepared to closely  
monitor the progress of her  
case through that Department.  
I have been told that under-

“THE QUESTION IS ASKED. WHAT DOES  
WOMAN WANT, MORE THAN SHE ENJOYS?  
I ANSWER, SHE ASKS NOTHING AS FAVOR.  
BUT AS RIGHT...SHE IS SEEKING NOT TO BE  
GOVERNED BY LAWS, IN THE MAKING OF  
WHICH SHE HAS NO VOICE” --1849

Opting ----

staffing causes delay and  
confusion, but reformation of  
this Department is impera-  
tive.  

Women--very vocal and in  
great numbers--must impress  
their state legislators with  
the necessity to adequately  
fund the Human Rights De-  
partment--and to follow-up  
with a convincing show of  
commitment to the cause of  
human rights.  

As a result of filing a  
sex discrimination charge, I  
have learned a great deal a-  
bout frustration in the face  
of bureaucracy. And, iron-  
ically, I have come to view  
the entire process as fut-  
ile--a meaningless act de-  
fined by male standards. It  
is utterly ridiculous to  
spend two years, money I  
could ill afford and emotion-  
al reserves to prove that my  
employer discriminated a-  
gainst women.  

Do fish swim? Does the  
sun set?  

Rather, I am arriving at  
a yet ill-defined belief  
that women--as a class--  
must reform our environment.  
We must go beyond the male  
world.  

I have no desire to run,  
equal Opportunity to be  
vice-president of widget  
marketing. That is not e-  
nough.  

I hope I will find an  
effective way to work with  
other women to achieve a  
reformation.  

I will leave men at their  
drawing boards, desks and  
in their board rooms, howl-  
ing at one another across  
the void created by their  
hatred and fear.

Working Women Band Together

by Heidi Reidell

Women in Minneapolis are

working for bread, not jew-
els. As in all other parts
of the country, the bread
seems more like crumbs—
fully employed women earn $3
for every $5 earned by their
male counterparts. The dis-
crepancy in pay has widened
during the past 15 years, but
the mechanics for change in
Minneapolis are growing
stronger.

The stereotype of the work-
ing girl who leaves her job
to marry and have children
doesn't hold up today. Three
fifths of the working women
in Minneapolis are married
and living with their hus-
bands and one-third are moth-
ers with children under the
age of six.

Most women work to raise
their families' standard. In families where the
husband earns between five
and seven thousand dollars
per year, 46% of the wives
work. In Minneapolis, 15% of
working mothers are heads of
households and only 5% of
these women receive welfare
funds. One fifth of working
women are single and self-
supporting and few women have
the luxury of working solely
for personal fulfillment.

Women have always worked to
support themselves and their
families. But since the in-
dustrial revolution women
have left the home and enter-
ed a labor system based on
the obsolete assumption that
they are marking time until
they can retire to the kit-
chen.

Women's role in the labor
force has changed radically
in the last 50 years. The
average woman worker in the
1920s was 28 years old and
single. She comprised 20% of
the labor force and had a life
expectancy of 55 years.

Today, the average working
woman is 39, married and was
30 years old when she sent her
last child off to school. She
can expect to live to be
75 years old.

Working women today are
highly educated. One woman
in ten has a college degree.
However, of the 91,000 work-
ing women in Minneapolis, 42%
have clerical jobs (5% higher
than the national average)
and only 3% are in managerial
positions (0.3% higher than
the national average). In
executive positions, men out-
number women 600 to 1.

From counterculture women's
organizations to a drop-in
center at the YWCA, women are
helping each other find jobs,
training and adequate day-
care facilities.

Aside from social and pol-
itical women's groups, self-
help professional groups are
forming. One such group,
Women in Communication, has
a job placement service
where women exchange inform-
ation about job openings that
are not usually announced pub-
licly.

Some local groups are aff-
iliated with national organ-
izations. Efforts are un-
derway to start a service
modeled after Catalyst, an
organization that places wom-
en in jobs and also pairs wo-
men with similar training so
they can share one job and
work part-time.

Within individual companies
women are becoming more vo-
cal about equal pay, job ad-
vancement and adequate day-
care for their children.

Careers are no longer a
secondary concern of women.

Many are choosing to postpone
having children at all. Those with
small children are working
in increasing numbers. Thir-
ty-five percent of mothers
with children under six are
working.

There are gross inequities
in pay scales, hiring and
promotion policies in Minn-
eapolis and the nation. But
the tools of change are be-
ing wielded by many deter-
mined and dedicated people
in this city.

The traditional female occ-
upations are filled to over-
flowing. Career planners see
expanding job opportunities
in the professions (medicine,
science, engineering, law,
architecture) and in voca-
tional careers (electronics,
mechanics, etc.).

But changing a nation's
labor structure takes time
and effort. The southern
congressman who tacked the
word sex on the 1964 Civil
Rights law in order to quash
the effort, inadvertently
gave women one of their most
powerful tools of advance-
ment. From this legislation
came the momentum for poten-
tially powerful legal action
against sex discrimination
and for legally required
affirmative action programs.
The mechanics to equalize
pay and promotion policies
are there.

Those involved in chang-
ing women's role in the em-
ployment world point to one
vital force of change—the
women themselves. And women
in Minneapolis are banding
together to better their
employment situation.

Harriet Lansing and Judy
Oakes, two attorneys, have
opened Minnesota's first
all-women law firm in St.
Paul.

Located at 400 Sibley St.,
Oakes & Lansing is one of
some half-dozen women's firms
in the nation.

Although they will not be
restricting their practice
to women, the lawyers feel
that their feminist philo-
sophy will affect their en-
tire practice. Assisting
them is a law clerk, a stu-
dent at William Mitchell Law
School.

Both Lansing and Oakes are
graduates of the University
of Minnesota Law School.
Oakes previously was an as-
sistant attorney general for
the state of Minnesota (the
first woman to be promoted
to that post) while Lansing
was a city attorney in St.
Paul (the first woman to
be appointed to that position).

prejudice.

My father is NOT a member
of liberal America. But this
attitude towards homosexuality
is also quite common among
the well-educated good liber-
als. Well, everyone is enti-
tled to a personal opinion,
aren't they? Even if it is
based on complete ignorance.
Even if it does destroy peo-
ple.

We don't think so. A collu-
sion between ignorance and
anxious conformity has perpe-
trated great wickedness upon
real people. And this very
considerable suffering inflic-
ted on anyone who knows or
fears that (s)he is gay is ab-
solutely unnecessary.

We are a group of individu-
als who are concerned about
stopping this human destruc-
tion. No single action will
accomplish the kind of change
in social attitudes that is
necessary. But there are sev-
eral obvious starting points.

First, there are certain po-
litical changes which are es-
sential. NOW is beginning to
compile a mailing list of per-
sons sympathetic to legal
form. If you are willing to

write a few letters to alder-
men, state legislators, etc.,
in favor of altering current
sex laws and of expanding the
coverage of existing human
rights laws, please send us
your address.

Secondly, most people--in-
cluding most liberals--are
quite ignorant of what it
means to be a homosexual in
our society. We strongly
urge all you who call your-
selves liberals, or human-
ists, or feminists--to take
the time to read Lesbian/Wo-
man by Del Martin and Phyllis
Lyon. It is available in
most libraries and paperback
bookstores, or may be ordered
through us.

We are also selling human

rights buttons and are in des-
perate need of contributions.
If you sympathize with us for
whatever reason, please help
us now. Our hour of need is
upon us.

Lesbian Motherhood
Study

Dear Sisters:

I am a graduate student in

the School of Social Work at

California State University,
Sacramento. I am presently
working on my master's thesis.

Lesbian mothers are now en-
gaged in court cases to gain

or regain custody of their
children and are in dire need
of support from many levels.
My hope for this thesis is
that it can be used to streng-
then the arguments and dispel
the negative stereotypes of
Lesbian motherhood, as well
as to increase society's a-
wareness and acceptance of
Lesbians and Lesbian child-
raising.

I have developed a question-
naire in conjunction with Del
Martin and Phyllis Lyon and
other members of the Lesbian
community, which is now ready
for distribution. My popula-
tion of subjects can include
any woman who considers her-
self to be a Lesbian who is
raising or has raised a child
whether or not they are now
living together.

To reach as many women as
possible, I need your help.
Can you announce the exis-
tence of this research to as
many women as possible? Wo-
men who are willing to com-
plete a questionnaire can
drop me a card letting me
know they will participate.

All replies will be held
strictly confidential and re-
sponses will be anonymous and
in no way connected to the
names or addresses of respon-
dents.

Obtaining a large number of

Lesbian mothers for my sample
is crucial to the effective-
ness of my thesis; any publi-
city you can give to this ef-
fort will be critical to its

success and greatly apprecia-
ted.

Thank you very much.
