Bobby Riggs met with a  
long-overdue defeat at the  
hands of Billie Jean King  
Thursday night at the Astro-  
dome. The score was a grat-  
ifying 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

There prevailed, as ann-  
ouncers Rosemary Casals and  
Howard Cosell frequently  
pointed out, "a football at-

bare-legged drill team.

Bobby developed a very con-  
venient cramp in his right  
arm after the sixth game in  
the third set. The offici-  
als leaped to his assistance  
by flashing "Bobby Riggs--  
Age 55" on the screen. The  
ploy, of course, was unsuc-  
cessful.

Before the match, everyone  
said, "Well, it's ridiculous  
for Billie to be on the  
court--after all, he's a hus-  
tler." Now everyone will be  
saying, "Well, it was ridi-  
culous for Bobby to be out

be the sucker for her lobs.) Billie Jean has returned his  
last lob, what has she pro-  
ven?

There was no Riggserian  
comedy in the game. Riggs  
soon realized that he had  
to play serious tennis if  
he expected to win. At  
first I was suspicious,  
thinking he was "psyching  
her out." But as the match  
went on, it became clear  
that he was "playing for his

life." The trappings of the match  
were clearly sexist, with  
the drill team, Cosell's  
description of King's "gown"  
and the "Tale of the Tape,"  

efforts of women to meet men  
on any grounds and not be de-  
feated.
