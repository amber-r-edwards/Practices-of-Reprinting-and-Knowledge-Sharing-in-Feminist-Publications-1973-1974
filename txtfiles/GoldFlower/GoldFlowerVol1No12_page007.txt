PENTAGRAPHS. *

The sea-green color that corresponds  
to the twelfth zodiacal sign could  
readily signify the envy which Piscean  
women inspire in their sisters.

But women born under the sign of the  
fish are more cursed than blessed by  
its astrological influence, for Pis-  
ces women satisfy our cultural re-  
quirements of "femininity" from the  
moment they open their liquid eyes.

Born under a sign not given to self-  
assertion, the Pisces woman is neither  
inwardly goaded nor outwardly guided  
to self-knowledge.

Pisces of both sexes are often lan-  
guid, purposeless beings, better  
dreamers than achievers, better poets  
than physicists. Alas for the Pisces  
man, for our society demands that men  
deny those tender qualities that char-  
acterize this sign; many a Pisces man  

has escaped into drink, drugs or self-

deprecation from this social pressure.  
Alas too for the Pisces woman, for her  
insidious conditioning merely rein-  
forces the worst traits of her signs:  
indecision, escapism, delusion, ro-  
manticism, qualities encouraged if not  
treasured by our society in its women.

With this negative reinforcement it  
is difficult for the Pisces woman to  
discover her potential and fulfill it.  
The sign's admirable qualities--imagination,  
empathy, self-transcendence--  
are so easily confused with its dele-  
terious traits that the Pisces woman,  
driven neither by inward nor outward  
demands, may never distinguish the pos-  
itive manifestations from the negative.

If Pisceans often evoke envy from  
other women, they must conversely be-  
ware of their conviction of feminine  
identity molded themselves.

Piscean women often fail to understand  
the difficulty other women may face in  
assuming the "feminine" role.

Pisces is too often a victim looking  
to claim as "woman's place."

In this light it is instructive to  
consider Anais Nin's diaries. The Pis-  
ces writer was long in recognizing her  
own complex motivations; she enjoyed  
masculine acclaim for her "femininity,"  
even considering herself the mythic  
woman men told her she was. The slow  
painful mergence of self in Nin's  
diaries should prove an inspiring les-  
son for the Pisces woman.

Other women born under this twelfth  
zodiacal sign include Angelina Grimke,  
Edna St. Vincent Millay, Emma Willard,  
Mary Lyon, Rosa Luxemburg, and Eliza-  
beth Barrett Browning.
