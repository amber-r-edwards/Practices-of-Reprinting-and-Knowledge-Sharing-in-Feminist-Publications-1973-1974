'Feminist Librarian Rescues  
| Scarlett --- Portnoy Tags Along  

When Barb Caron began her  
job as the librarian in the  
Alexandria, Minnesota public  
library, she found that books  
like Portnoy's Complaint,  
Black Like Me, yoga and health  
books were kept behind the  
counter, and Gone with the  
Wind could not be checked out  
by anyone under 18.  

Today, a year later, those  
books are out on the shelf,  
along with such books as  
Sisterhood is Powerful, Women  
and Madness, and William's  
Doll.  

mer Peace Corps volunteer,  
mothers, and career women.  

Solid Friends  

After the course was over,  
the women decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-  
raising group. They have  
since formed solid friend-  
ships and "helped each other  
through rough spots." Barb  
says the group "made me more  
comfortable with myself and  
gave me reinforcement." The  
group is now thinking of  
forming a speakers bureau.  

Barb has been introducing  
feminism to almost everyone  
in Alexandria. She teaches  
a mini-course in cooking to  
eight students from the local  
grade school. The course  
was open to everyone, but  
boys were the only ones who  
signed up!  

Expansion and Outreach  

Barb, who graduated in 1972  
from the College of St. Cath-  
erine, has revitalized the  
library physically as well as  
ordering new books. Along  
with a progressive Library  
Board, she has ordered new  
carpeting, shrubs, and paint.  

She has also expanded the  
library's services. She is  

beginning an Outreach program

involving all of Douglas  
county. She reviews books on  
television, radio, and in  

the local newspaper,  

Her influence extends to  
other aspects of the commun-  
ity, where they welcome her  
fresh approach. She address-  
es women's and men's clubs on  
library matters and women's  
issues. Recently, the Alex-  
andria Business and Profes-  
sional Women's Club chose her  
as their candidate for Young  
Woman of the Year.  

Strange Feminist  

One of her favorite activi-  
ties was an adult education  
class on women called "You've  
Come a Long Way, Baby!" which  
she taught to eight women.  

The class brought together  
isolated women with little  

in common but their dissat-  
isfaction. Among them were  

a high school student (her  
friends think she's "strange"  
for being a feminist), a for-
