MINIMUM WAGE VETO VOTE

As you probably know, on September 19, 1973, the House by a vote of 259 yeas to 164 nays, about
23 votes less than the necessary two-thirds, failed to override President Nixon's veto of the minimum
wage bill.

Following are the names of the Representatives who voted against overriding the President's veto, 
i.e. to kill the minimum wage bill, or who did not vote at all. X indicates not voting.
