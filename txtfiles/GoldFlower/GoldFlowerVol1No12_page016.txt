WEAL FILES SUIT

30 Metro School Districts Charged
With Failure to Hire Women Teachers

Ellen Dresselhuis, President of the Minnesota Divi- 
sion of Women's Equity Ac- 
tion League (WEAL) announced 
this week that WEAL in con- 
junction with Susan B. An- 
thony's birthday, Feb. 15, 
has filed suit with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) against 30 
in 32 school districts of Minnesota, 
charging sex discrimination in the 
employment of senior high 
school teachers. Duplicate complaints 
have been filed with the U.S. 
Department of Health, Education, 
and Welfare (HEW). On the basis 
of research done by WEAL, it found that 
1/3 of the school districts in the 
metropolitan area have no females 
in their senior high social studies 
departments, 1/3 have fewer than 
10%, and the remaining 1/3 have 
10-38%. Only two school districts 
(West St. Paul and South St. Paul) 
have female representation in senior 
high social studies.

The percentage of women hired as 
senior high social studies teachers 
does not reflect the availability of 
women for these positions. In 1972, 
at the Sees (continued from page 12) 
placement and registered with the 
Placement Service were female. 
At Mankato, 23% were female. 
At St. Cloud, he will begin to shed them 
behavior patterns of dominance and 
aggression will be evolutionarily at a 
discount; and if that happens, he will 
begin to shed them.

Copies of the complaint have been sent 
to Howard Casmey, Minnesota 
Commissioner of Education, with a 
letter stating that the Minnesota 
State Board of Education's pamphlet 
"Eliminating Sex Bias in Education: 
A Policy and Proposed Action" has 
not been acted upon and that a 
definite affirmative action program 
should be pursued to ensure equal 
opportunity for women and men, 
and girls and boys.

Forget it," she says, "unless it's some 
rat-infested, roach-infested dump, then 
it's okay." Finances are an omnipresent 
problem to Sally, as to other AFDC mothers. 
"Welfare discourages women from going 
out to work. You can't make enough on 
your own to raise your family," she 
says. "If you work, you probably can't 
earn more than you'd get on AFDC." 
As for social life, "you just hang it 
up," Sally says. "You don't see people 
at work, you don't have money to go out. 
If your friends aren't on AFDC, their 
husbands might not want them to associate 
with you. You can just about forget about 
having a social life. 

"People get so concerned about the 
money spent on welfare. Well, I wonder 
about all the money spent on that war."
