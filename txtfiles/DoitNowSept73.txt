NOW MEMBERS — SENSITIZE YOUR CONGRESSPEOPLE!  

Anyone wishing a copy of the proceedings of Rep. Martha Griffiths’ hearings on the Economic  
Role of Women before the Joint Economic Committee should request copies from their own  
Senators or Representatives. REMEMBER: REQUESTING SUCH INFORMATION FROM  
YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES IS A GOOD WAY TO POINT OUT TO THEM  
THAT CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN’S ISSUES!  

ATTENTION NOW MEMBERS! RIGHT-TO-LIFERS ARE AT IT AGAIN!  

As of this writing, the Right-to-Lifers and some church groups were again attacking abortion  
with a vengeance — this time through the “MAUDE” TV series and CBS Television.  

Background: Over 20 stations throughout the country refused to broadcast the repeat of the  
two-part MAUDE program on abortion scheduled for August 14 & 21. The stations included:  
WWL, New Orleans; WMBD, Peoria, Illinois; WISM, Milwaukee; WNAC, Austin, Texas;  
KXJB, Fargo, N. D.; WSBT, South Bend, Indiana; WTEN, Albany, N. Y.  

As of August 14, two sponsors had withdrawn from the program, with pressure from right-to-  
life groups cited as the cause.  

According to NOW President Wilma Scott Heide:  

“BUT NOW CAN PRESSURE TOO. Anti-abortion groups have no patent on  
letter-writing.  
NOW MEMBERS ARE URGED TO WRITE TO THESE SPONSORS TO  
PROTEST THEIR WITHDRAWAL FROM SPONSORSHIP OF THE PROGRAM  
and furthermore, to avoid buying their products.”

YOU ARE NOW’S LOBBYIST: LOBBYING AS A CHAPTER ACTION PROGRAM

This is the month your chapter will probably be deciding on its program for the year. It is vitally

important that lobbying your Congresspersons be a part of that program. The lobbying that
really counts is the lobbying that you and your chapter do at and from home — not only indivi-
dually through letters and calls to your legislators’ offices, but as a chapter by meeting with
them at home. Our efforts in Washington depend on you.

What follows is a suggested program for your chapter to lobby your Representative. You may

want to adapt it for your state legislators also, with help from your State Legislative Coordinator,

who may also be arranging for meetings with your Senators. (We are grateful to the State
Legislative Coordinators from California — Geri Sherwood, Michigan — and Illinois for some
of the materials used here.)

This kind of lobbying is not only what makes our efforts possible in Washington, but is the kind
of service your chapter can and should provide for its members and prospective members.

PLANNING THE MEETING

Pre-planning the meeting makes for the best results. As a chapter, decide what the goals are
for your meeting (opening up communications with your Representative’s office, getting a
commitment to oppose the abortion amendment and discharge petition, supporting credit
legislation, childcare, etc. — your chapter legislative coordinator and other task force coordina-
tors will have materials from their task forces). Plan for several of you to go — four or five at
the most — your Legislative Task Force person, President, relevant Task Force Coordinators
might be your choices. Decide on what points you want to cover — probably no more than
three — and divide up the topics so that one person leads the discussion on each point. Get to-
gether or prepare materials on each point. If you are nervous, role-play the meeting before
you go, trying to anticipate questions or objections to your program your Representative may
have. (She/he may surprise you and be very receptive!) Try to have someone in your sortie
of the same political party as your Representative.

ARRANGE THE MEETING  
Call or write your Representative’s home office, explain who you are, and that you want to

have a meeting next time she/he is in town. List the topics you want to cover and who will be
attending from the chapter, and what their chapter functions are.

THE MEETING

1. *Take some literature with you: NOW’s Bill of Rights (especially), NOW’s goals, position papers on dope sheets from the National Task Forces on Issues of interest to you, a sample of your chapter newsletter or publication.

2. *Tell a little about your chapter — what its priorities are, its successes, mention briefly your newsletter and your speaker’s bureau so they know you get to a lot of people. Don’t say how large or how small your chapter or NOW is — instead stress our importance as opinion-makers.

3. *Limit your presentation to probably no more than three points, but make them good and forceful. Make sure they are all things on which federal action is required. Decide ahead what points you want to cover, and what your goals are for the meeting (opening up communications with their offices, getting a yes on extension of minimum wage or childcare, etc.) If there are several of you, divide up the topics so a different person leads the discussion on each point. [Speak for the Chapter or for NOW (Our chapter’s priorities are... NOW’s legislative program calls for . . . )]

4. *Ask their offices to do something for you — keep your chapter informed or provided with copies of bills, send your legislative task force person the Congressional Record. Ask to be placed on their mailing list for the newsletters they send to their home district.

5. “Let them know what you can do for them — support them on bills, ask if you can arrange for them to speak at a chapter meeting or rally when they're home (be sure you get a good turnout), mention anything good they've done in the chapter newsletter, get them information they could use on bills they want to introduce and support or put in the Congressional Record, etc.

FOLLOW-UP

Write a letter when you get home summarizing the points of the discussion and thanking them for meeting with you. Let them know your chapter will keep in touch.

* * * * *

The most effective way to lobby is to be informed, brief and efficient. Your Representative will not agree with you on everything, but remember that in lobbying today’s enemy is tomorrow’s friend. If you can’t get to them on this issue, you may get to them on the next. Confrontation is a tactic among other tactics — use it only when it may pay off for you, and only when you have carefully planned for it.

ABORTION AMENDMENT STRATEGY

Task Force on Reproduction & Its Control  
Jan Liebman, Coordinator  

P. O. Box 40542  

Palisades Station  

Washington, D. C. 20016  

(This local action is outlined for the 30 ratified states. Members in the 20 unratified states will  
want to concentrate efforts on the E. R. A. and not confuse the two issues. The opposition  
is trying to connect them to defeat the E. R. A.)  

STATUS REPORT ON ABORTION  

The last two Do It Now Blue Sheets have contained information on the Constitutional Amend-  
ment on Abortion from the Reproduction Task Force and the Legislative Office. The newest  
developments concern who will control the hearing process in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  
Senator James Eastland (D-Miss.) has recently decided to co-sponsor the Buckley Constitutional  
Amendment to guarantee the Right-To-Life of the fetus. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary  
Committee, Senator Eastland could use his power to take hearing authority on the Constitutional  
Amendment away from Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.). (He has already bypassed Senator Bayh  
by holding hearings on the Constitutional Amendment on Busing.) Senator Bayh states that his  
mail is running very pro-amendment at this time and that other Senators are beginning to exper-  
ience pressure also.  

PURPOSES AND FOCUS:  

This local action outline has a target: we want our Congresspersons to oppose the Constitutional  
Amendments on Abortion and support the Supreme Court decision. Always keep that target in  
sight! NOW chapters should engage in as much local lobbying at the home offices of Senators  
and Congresspersons as is possible. We also need to identify and develop the strong community  
support of individuals and groups outside NOW for the Supreme Court decision on abortion.  
Remember, the opposition intends to do the same thing!  

TACTICS  

The opposition will be using all the emotionalism they can muster from the very beginning,  
through color slide shows, color picture books, and pickled fetuses. NOW should begin our  
present campaign by giving legal, rational arguments against the Amendment. All NOW educa-  
tional efforts — speeches, television appearances, flyers — should have the goals of generating  
mail to Senators and Congresspersons which demonstrates that community support exists for  
the Supreme Court Decision and against the Constitutional Amendment. Take stationery and  
stamps with you to meetings and get people to write on the spot!

N. O.W. CHECK LIST FOR ACTION: FALL 1973:

Get the Mail Out — Educate Congress.  
Get phone calls to home offices of Senators and Congresspersons.  
Make appointments to see Senators and Congresspersons at Thanksgiving Recess time.  

Work on PAR Congressional Research kits.  
THANKSGIVING 1973  

Meet with your Senators and Congresspersons:  

Ask them their stand on the Constitutional Amendments.  

Inform them of NOW’s position.  

Ask them if they answered NOW questionnaire on Supreme Court decision.  
Report results of interviews to NOW Legislative Office.  

DECEMBER 1973  
Finish up PAR Congressional Research kit. Mail results in to NOW Legislative Office.  
JANUARY 1974  

Have letters to Senators and Congresspersons waiting on their desks by January 15, 1974  
when they return to session.  

Remind them in the letters about the questionnaire and about their statements at your  
Thanksgiving interview.  
FEBRUARY — MARCH 1974  

Primary watches — The opposition has claimed they will challenge pro-Supreme Court  
decision Senators and Congresspersons in the primaries. The Legislative Office will need  
solid information on where abortion becomes a hot primary issue and the results.  

LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:  

(Because feminist arguments against the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit  
abortion are often ineffective, it is important that we learn to use a broad range of reasons  
for opposition. The following are some suggestions which you might find helpful; learn  
to use them!)  

1. CONSTITUTIONAL PURITY  

Don’t junk up the Constitution — technology could make the abortion issue obsolete —  
opens the door to busing and school prayer amendments — establishes an absolute in  
a fluid, pluralistic society.  

A

. PRACTICAL PROBLEMS (PROHIBITION AGAIN?)

Will not prevent abortions — past laws, no matter how strict, have not prevented abortion —  
will generate lawlessness, black market increase — increase organized crime involvement.

. CRIMINAL LAW:

Abortion will be prosecuted as murder although never considered as such even under the  
strictest laws in the past.

Actions resulting in miscarriage would be considered a crime possibly resulting in a charge  
of manslaughter.

No pregnant woman could be jailed in the absence of a reason to jail the “fetus person.”  
A woman who took a drug for illness or for her health which inadvertently resulted in a  
spontaneous abortion could be charged with murder.

. TAXES

Would the fetus be counted as a dependent for tax purposes — from the moment of conception?  
How far could and would the IRS go to verify the pregnancy? Would Medicaid be available to  
fetuses? And Child-Welfare support?

. IMMIGRATION:

What would be the citizenship status of a fetus?

Could the fetus be a person and not a citizen? Would all children conceived by alien persons  
in the U.S. be citizens? Could a pregnant woman who is not a citizen be deported when she is  
“carrying a fetus citizen?”

. CHILD NEGLECT:

Could the state force the mother to comply with certain standards of care and activity for the  
protection of the fetus?

Could a pregnant woman be prosecuted if she smokes since this causes lower birth weight?  
Could drug-addicted women be prosecuted for more serious crimes — such as for pushing —  
due to addiction of the fetus to drugs?

- PRIVACY:

What would become of a woman’s right to privacy as the state expanded its efforts to protect  
the constitutional rights of the fetus? Would pregnancies have to be registered from the moment  
of conception?

Could State police be assigned as guardians to the fetus to ensure its well-being at all times?

The arguments are many and can be used effectively in discussing this issue with the neutral or  
uncommitted men who are lawyers, doctors, Senators, and Representatives. Good luck in putting  
them to use. Remember preservation of the right to choose is in our hands.

ERA NEWS  
MARYLAND STATE ERA  

Maryland voters approved a State ERA by Referendum in May 1972. The State ERA  
went into effect July 1972. The State Legislature re-convened in January 1973.  

SENATOR STEERS (voted Federal ERA) went through the Maryland Code with a computer  
and simply pulled out those sections of the law which referred to sex in any way. His  
strategy was to merely change the language throughout the entire code. In some areas this  
formula worked rather well, in others — notably domestic law — this method proved to be  
disastrous, resulting in anything but equality.  

The Steers Bills caused quite an uproar and immediately, everyone concerned began  
looking for other ways of implementation of the ERA.  

1) Delegate Charles Blumenthal, who had previously sponsored the ERA ratification  
in the House, came up with a resolution to give the Attorney General power of  
declaratory judgment over the ERA. For various reasons, such as slowness,  
inconsistency, and the basic illegality of such a resolution, NOW and other groups  
opposed this method. The resolution was killed in committee.  

2) The Women’s Law Center (Baltimore) and the Maryland State Commission on the  
Status of Women screened the “Steers Bills.” The Bills were separated into three  
categories: good, recommended; mediocre, not recommended; hopelessly  
inadequate, not recommended. NOW adopted these recommendations and with  
the coordination of Casey Hughes, State Coordinator, Sylvia Wright, State Legis-  
lative Coordinator, and Ellen Luff, NOW member and attorney. Basically  
speaking the goals were accomplished in regard to these bills.  

3) Maryland NOW reports that actually most legislators were anxious to support  
good legislation, but the Steers Steamroller caused considerable confusion and  
tempers grew short on all sides. The solution to this quagmire was to call a halt  
to legislation implementation and provide for a Governor’s Commission to study  
and recommend legislation for the January 1974 session.  

LEGISLATIVE OFFICE STATE ERA IMPLEMENTATION FILES  

The NOW Legislative Office is currently designing a file system to incorporate State ERA  
action on implementation. This file will provide information on studies, action, persons  
involved with State ERA implementation. Please forward all information to the Legislative  
Office concerning your state. Ratification of the ERA is NOW’s priority! However, politics  
does not work in a vacuum as illustrated by the Maryland Case described above. The Phyllis  
Schlafley Report/May listed a “horror” story on Maryland. This has been mailed by the  
Anti’s to all state legislators in Indiana and Louisiana. The Report listed 17 “horror” bills —  
only one of those listed actually passed (and that was one on protective legislation).  

With this information we will be able to act as a referral service for NOW members and coordi-  
nators lobbying for implementation. According to our information, the Maryland Governor’s  
Commission for implementation is the first of its kind. This may be helpful to other states  
planning implementation. Contact Maryland State Coordinator for more information:  

Casey Hughes, 1400 Bayside Drive, Edgewater, MD 21037.

P A R — NOW ERA TWO YEAR STRATEGY

POLITICAL ACTION RESEARCH (P A R) is the first phase of NOW’s 2-Year ERA Strategy.

It is a lobbying tool for political analysis of all legislators in unratified states, carried out by
NOW members in the legislators’ districts. It comes in the form of a pamphlet to be filled out
with information that will make effective lobbying possible: who legislators’ campaign con-
tributors are, what organizations they belong to, issues they ran on, etc. Copies of the pamphlet
will be kept on file in the Chapter, the State Legislative Coordinator, and in the Legislative
Office. NOW will have the most complete files anywhere of those 20 states.

We plan to adapt this program for the other 30 states and for Congress as soon as humanly
possible.

Some news from the NOW ERA “investigating reporters”:

FLORIDA: “....in my Chapter, members are actually fighting over who gets
a P A R to fill out! — “...the things we’re finding out!!"

ALABAMA: “Legislature has been under court order to reapportion — but action
has been pending since 1963! So guess we will go on with P A R
since things don’t seem to move very fast here — surprised to find out
that LWV has a number of uncovered counties — P A R is great — the
booklet seems complete in itself and will prove useful to all those
who participate in the study...

MINIMUM WAGE BILL

BACKGROUND: As you know, the Minimum Wage Bill is NOW’s top Federal priority legislation this year.  
*The Bill has been passed by both houses,  
“has gone through Joint Conference,  
“came out with everything in it we wanted,  
(especially coverage of domestic workers)  
*and is now ready to go to the President for signing.  

All during the House and Senate debate, however, there were intimations from Republican leaders that the bill would be vetoed by the President as inflationary. That, of course, is  

a terrible irony. As Senators pointed out during the debate, inflation has so increased prices that a worker would have to earn $2.16 an hour right now to buy what he or she was able to buy for the $1.60 an hour minimum Congress approved in 1966 and that has been unchanged since then. What’s more, the $2.20 an hour minimum doesn’t even go into effect immediately. It will take till 1975 before all the non-farm workers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act reach $2.50. Farm workers won't get there until 1976.  

THE BILL WILL BE SENT TO THE PRESIDENT AFTER AUGUST 25TH IN ORDER TO PREVENT A “POCKET VETO” WHILE CONGRESS IS IN RECESS. IF THE PRESIDENT SHOULD VETO THE BILL WHEN HE GETS IT, CONGRESS WILL BE BACK SEPT. 5TH AND WILL TRY TO OVERRIDE THE VETO — SOMETHING THAT HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE THIS SESSION — SO FAR!  

*ACTION - WRITE, WIRE YOUR CONGRESSPERSON AND SENATOR, URGING OVERRIDE IF A VETO OCCURS!!!  

LABOR — HEW VETO THREAT — Coalition for Human Needs and Budget Priorities  

BACKGROUND: Confrontation over national spending priorities between the Congress and the President grows closer as the Senate puts the finishing touches on the Labor-Health, Education & Welfare Appropriation. At stake are numerous human needs programs that the Administration slated for demise in its FY 74 Budget Message.  

*******If the President chooses to veto the Labor-HEW package, as expected, the stage will be set for an effort to OVERRIDE THE VETO, which has only happened once so far!  

The House approved a Labor-HEW Appropriation package on June 26 that is squarely out of the range of Administration expectation — $1.25 billion over Mr. Nixon’s request. Included in the increase is funding for such programs as education for disadvantaged children, hospital construction and modernization, OEO Community Action Agencies, and Legal Service and Senior Citizens Programs, Regional Medical Programs and others — all programs the President wanted to eliminate or reduce in scope. The Senate is currently holding hearings and will finish work  

on the bill in early September. Early speculation is that it will increase funding for these programs — putting the entire Congress squarely on the line against the President.  

Mr. Nixon has repeatedly threatened to veto any bill he considers ‘fiscally irresponsible’. The HEW bill fits his definition. We can therefore expect a veto of the Labor-HEW bill in mid-September, after the Senate and House complete their conference report.  

“IN THE EVENT OF A VETO, WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND BOTH SENATORS URGING AN OVERRIDE. WE MUST HAVE IT TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY’S PRIORITIES FROM MILITARY TO THE MUCH NEEDED DOMESTIC PROGRAMS!

PRESIDENT’S COMMENTS  

“If you/your chapter want to work on the Bicentennial: NOW found the AMERICAN REVOLUTION BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION to be undemocratic, political, commercial and anti-feminist; so we have joined others to form the independent WOMEN’S COALITION FOR THE THIRD CENTURY. Exciting projects related to our past, the present and our future will be in the works and await your creation. The goal is the empowerment of women.” NOW President Heide is on the steering committee. Chair-One is Reverend Patricia Budd Kepler (NOW member). Contact her at the Harvard Divinity School, 45 Francis Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

Dr. George Wiley, National Coordinator of the MOVEMENT FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE and former Executive Director of the NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, drowned on August 8. Our nation has lost a champion of justice. In memory of George and to modestly aid our common cause, NOW President Heide contributed $25 to support the movement Dr. Wiley was creating.
