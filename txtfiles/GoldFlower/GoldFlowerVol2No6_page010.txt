Wedding palms, rented for weddings  
were also funeral palms,  
rented for funerals.  
THE “TRES Kiches He URES This is where, in the dark tubs,  
cats and field rabbits came  
to give birth to their wet, unfinished babies;  
where, in the midst of her most coiled fantasy,  

HAM PL the most personal story of jungle life,  
the little girl was also thinking happily:  

Call me home,  

call me home for dinner.  
A jungle slowly flattens itself  
until you realize  

it is a prairie where you live  
and what grows here is  

fields of sameness,  

acres of calm,  

a beauty so unfantastic  

you are relaxed into the plains,  
the memories.  

A house stands  

in the middle of the prairie.  
Inside a woman sits  

with a sewing basket  

piled with dreams  

which are not wishes.  

These are the actual dreams,  
full of spinsters  

who cover their new pale shoes  
carefully with Kleenex,  

where inappropriate women sit.  
The woman sits in the pine board house.  
before things called "hearths." If even she is nervous,  

Do they know where they are?  
her lip gnawed ragged,  

They keep saying, proof of her imperfect adultness,  

"This is a museum. Be afraid."  
for consolation  

the present moment  

like an illuminated manuscript  

bright with tendrils of memory and future.  
This balancing tail may help her  

reach the hours she is trying to get back to,  
back to the possibility of saying,  

Paige  

I am thinking of a time  
when all the parts of a life  
were balanced like animals  
with their perfect tails.  

My father's greenhouse:  

Go play in the palm house  
Mother, Father,  
till I call you for dinner. You did not stop me.  

The difference is only in time  

and games,  
breathing city nights,  
stilling any need for others  
in a myth of freedom  
I dream in summers.  

Today in the biting cold and swollen  
from a night of close calls  

I remember how it was to ride the bus  

knowing that the love we seldom made  

In the basement still sewed the days together.  

of girlhood failures  

you slept in the furnace music,  

your home regardless  

of the fights upstairs;  

you always went there  
when its summer musk  
began-- away from you sleeping,  
it made you ache in the corners  
and think of spiders, black, seal-fur thighs;  
how dark-haired men might wait  
to bite your lips.  
in sleek and untamable power  
The voices before knifing through  
were kept from you by the wind;  
the blue, cool room like a froth of ice and burning  
led you out of that small town's gasoline  
indolent eyes  
to the lake and the thin hoot  
of summer owls, how clouds  
like the hair of seraphic runners  
grazed the mountains.  
Yet, there was no dinner for you.  
And no invader near  
to drive you harder with fearful lust.  
Don't ask me what it was--  

too quick, or late, not a hunting  
season. Or that  
I assumed the character  
of heroes always entering  
without speech  
under cover of the dark.
