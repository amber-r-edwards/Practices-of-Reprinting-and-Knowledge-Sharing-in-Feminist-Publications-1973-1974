Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 1

Poetry

Our woman-heritage is one of love and power and courage and
beauty. Woman, life-giver, earth-molder, passer-down through
centuries of daughter birth the strength of humanness, corrupted
by man’s myth of evil, sapped by the man-child’s parasite’s
sucking bite, trampled with his rush to die.

In 1945, a huge and gleaming structure, built to soar and dip
and dive and top the clouds in the wake of dreams’ exhaust, was
named for two women, was made pregnant with a device more
horrible than womankind’s worst fears, was made to carry this
device to a small and remote place called Hiroshima, and in a
swift delivery, bore death and destruction. The following poem,
our life-course. It meant to cry for all women, to anger, to stir,
and to unite.

ENOLA Gay
Enola Gay
was a lady,
they say
a sleek, slender
lady
of sensuous way, to feel the void in ourselves
a dark, daring the crush of emptiness.
lady go easy, dear girl,
See your shadow is an open grave.
‘oolaat your carbine is a convenience
She bought like a credit card,
all the dreams He abit oli
to appear in a vision.

SOME LINES FOR PATTY

that day

without any they cannot afford to let you live,

hubbub, confusion, — so calm this can mean
their eyes devour cities.

She bought
all the dreams
and went on her way,

their tongues drip honeydew
upon the wounds of the poor.

the shapes of sleep are all around us.

a Patty, find me a way out of this labyrinth,
beautifully beautiful this gray tissue punctuated

lady, by the shock of searchlights.

they say. you are creating your own myth:

But dreams are a rebirth myth.

a danger when the time comes

and only delay you will vanish into it.
the marching of progress this is your safe-conduct,
as time slips away, your cloak of invisibility.
A sensible lady ~-Janet McReynolds
as Enola Gay
doesn't buy dreams
to fill up the day.
So they took her
and wrapped her
in concrete and gauze,
so nicely removing
the proximal cause,
and the dreams, hopes,
and plans
of Enola Gay
were washed down
the drainpipe
and mixed with red clay.
When they had done
on that horrible day
they put on
a death mask
and hauled her away.
Such is the story
of Enola Gay,
a wonderfully womanly
lady,
they say.

“Anonymous has been the
oldest, most persistent writer
in history. It is a widely felt
belief that works signed
anonymous were often the
creation of women. Women,
repressed as they were and
unaccepted as thoughtful and
creative humans were often
ashamed to submit works
with their names or too fearful
of social condemnation. The
repression did not halt the
flow of the emotions and
feelings, only forced them
underground so that works
labeled anonymous are often
our strongest clue to works
“by a woman writ.”

TERRAN WOMAN
I have learned that rocks are clouds in process
that the trees behind you are helping us
hold up our half of the sky—strength in the only way
I understand it

~-Anonymous

The learning traverses within me
I come as witness

In the splinters of wood
your axe shatters seed

You would offer yourself as earth

would hew yourself in mind and roots

You are woman cloning herself to the firmament
Woman sculpting the air with her breasts
Woman shaping woman

Standing between the shadows of my coming and going flesh
in the changing particles of spirit
now here

now in herstory made from the texture of meadow bellies
and the nipples of other mountains

my own shaping appears in the boundary between horizons
pauses to breathe in a momentary centering

I could have done a million things. but love you

I AM A WORLDWIND
and my words will strike like thunder and lightning demolishing the
male misogynic myths into the rightful place of absurdity and obscurity they deserve. I will laugh at the absurd male and his pompous sense
in the unimportance of life. His busy consuming need to consume
himself and the world around him. He will not consume me or the
Woman I love. We will fight him smashing out at his idiocy, we will
tear his ideology limb from limb. We will take his vision and make it
into fragile orbs that shatter into powder blue clouds upon the anvil of
his head. LAUGH WOMAN! For this is a pitiless creature upon whom,
you need bestow nothing but hatred for the cruelty his race has sub-
jected your ancient mother family to... OP —

DANCE WOMAN! We dance to celebrate our declaration of War, our
separation from the fatherland, from the father almighty, from your
father/brother/husband. Our determination to destroy through crea-
tion their stupidity. DANCE because we are building our own fortress
to forestall their attempts at colonization, their imperial demands for
our minds, our bodies, our being. Seize your body and feel the strength
coursing through your veins, let your laughter ring out into the hills
bouncing off and coming back to you sevenfold. Seize your mind and
point it in the direction that benefits you and the Woman you love.
