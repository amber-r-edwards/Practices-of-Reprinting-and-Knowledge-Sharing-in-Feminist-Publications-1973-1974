WOMAN ALIVE!  
Women Recorded

Elissa Meyer

WOMAN ALIVE! above all  
else celebrates the diversity of  
women. The program does not  
pass judgment, nor offer an  
evaluation of lifestyles or  
struggles. Each segment of-  
fers insight into the unique  
circumstances of each wo-  
man's life. The camera probes  
into the interpersonal difficul-  
ties of Pat and Charles  
Sackrey who are “working  
hard on being together.” And  
it records the concerns of  
Iowan women encountering  
disrespect and discrimination  
on their jobs. The stereotype of  
“women’s movement - as -  
white - middle - class” is  
beautifully denounced as  
black women of the National  
Black Feminist Organization  
discuss the peculiarities of  
their dual oppression, and  
finally as Crystal Lee’s story  
of union organizing unfolds  
for us. Crystal Lee Jordan of  
Roanoke Rapids, North Caro-  
lina does not talk with her  

Pat Sackrey talks with  
Charles. She goes each day to  
picket lines and union rallies,  
whereas Pat works long hours  
at the Everywoman’s Center in  
Massachusetts.

And like the women’s  
movement itself, the program  
sets off a melody singing  
inside you; the refrain echoes  
in your mind and you want to  
hear more. I felt like I wanted  
to put every woman in front of  
a camera to tell her story, to  
elaborate on her struggles.  
Because I share the profound  
belief that in respecting, and  
indeed celebrating, the u-  
niqueness and strength of a  
woman’s character, regard-  
less of her particular situa-  
tion, women will break the  
bondage of stereotype, self-  
denigration and roles for  
good. As Milissa Manchester  
sings at the end of the  
program, “Oh heaven how  
you’ve changed for me now...  
the miracle is in my soul....”

WOMAN ALIVE! producer Joan Shigekawa enjoys a light moment with textile union organizer Crystal Lee  
Jordan -- the subject of a film profile in the one-hour special produced by KERA-TV Dallas/Fort Worth in  
collaboration with Ms. magazine. It was broadcast June 19 at 8:00 p.m. on Channel 6.

Comment

It was remarkably appro-  
priate to have Maya Angelou  
follow WOMAN ALIVE! Maya  
says of Aesuit “I, a woman;  
I, a black; I, a human.” It is  
society which attaches labels  
and stereotypes to these facts  
because then society need not  
deal with the human element  
in all of us. She goes on to  
comment on the validity of  
struggles for liberation. Even  
though she differentiates be-  
tween white women’s issues  
and black women’s issues she  
conveys a respect, more than  
that, a necessity, for each  
group to deal with its own  
oppression. Similarly, as to  
race relations, Ms. Angelou  
regards Watergate as the most  
important matter for white  
folks because it affords us the  
opportunity to confront our  
own morality and integrity, to  
clean up our own backyard.

One of her most moving  
statements was in answer to
