JOB MARKET)  

Yes, I went to  
college.  

But Speedwriting  
got me my job.  

Having a college degree doesn’t automatically mean a boy  

can step right into the job of his dreams.  
To open the right doors, often what’s needed is a business COLORADO'S  
skill your prospective boss can use. Like shorthand.  
But ordinary symbol shorthand takes a lot of time to learn.  
And even if you didn’t spend years in college, who wants to  
waste months and months grinding away with strange signs and  
squiggles?  
Speedwriting Shorthand is something else. It’s based on sim-  
ple, everyday ABCs. Those familiar ABCs and ideals of a new feminist  
consciousness.
