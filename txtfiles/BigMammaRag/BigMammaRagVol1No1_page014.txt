Before and After

In doing political work, I have  
found myself in situations where it  
has always been very easy for me to  
remain passive—to prefer others,  
“especially men, to do the work that  
I was too insecure or self-  
conscious to do. I have always  
known "which side I was on," but I  
have not always been so sure of the  
reasons why. Never having had much  
practice at actually analyzing sit-  
uations myself, I was therefore  
very impressed (and intimidated) by  
people who could develop complex  
analyses and intellectualizations  
of different situations. This, of  
course, played right into my pas-  
sivity, my willingness to accept  
someone else's theory, my insecuri-  
ty in putting forward my own. Now,  
I am beginning to feel much better  
about myself and I have more confi-  
dence in my abilities to think, and  
this carries over into my relation-  
ships with others. I know that I  
have to PUSH myself to do those  
things that are important to do—  
to participate, to be active—even  
if I may feel terribly uncomfor-  
table and awkward. One of the most  
important factors in this is the  
support I get from my sisters.

Support Raises Consciousness

This support not only makes me  
strong enough to speak out in  
groups and contribute my opinions,  
but I find that it becomes easier  
to do the kind of reading and re-  
search necessary to enable me to  
raise my political consciousness to  
the point where I think it should  
be. It isn't hard anymore to admit  
my ignorance without shame, be-  
cause I know that I have the  
strength to do the self-education  
necessary to remedy that ignorance.  
I feel oftentimes that men are re-  
sentful of this kind of obvious  
strength. I understand that reac-  
tion, but it is only an example of  
the sexism which is in all of us.  
Most of us have learned to be  
threatened by people who are  
strong, who could be potential  
"competition."

These kinds of hostile, uptight  
reactions are balanced by the  
patronizing, "older brother" atti-  
tudes of some other movement men.  
It is almost as if they merely  
tolerate my sympathies with THEIR  
ideas—it makes me feel like a  
movement groupie. And it is an  
obvious indication that those men  
do not consider my political com-  

mitment and understanding to be any-  
where near as serious as their own.

This brings up a question which  
has been especially significant to  
me in dealing with "hip" or "move-  
ment" men: the question of integra-  
ting my sexuality with my intellect.  
I consider myself a political person,  
and also a sexual person. It has  
been possible for me a number of  
times to have truly meaningful rela-  
tionships with men—relationships in  
which little was hidden, thoughts  
were shared and expressed honestly—  
but these were rarely sexual rela-  
tionships. The most egalitarian ex-  
periences I have had with men were  
not physical at all. And in the  

same way, the sexual relationships I  
have had with men were rarely able  
to develop into anything deeper  
without being extremely sexist—in  
other words, my role in the rela-  
tionship had already been defined in  
a purely sexual way. So, a problem  
arises—in order to keep myself out  
of exploitive situations, I find  
myself continually denying my sexu-  
ality—negating my womanhood in or-  

der to function effectively with men.

I ignore my physical feelings as  
best I can—I have consciously de-  
cided that it is actually safer and  
much less hassle to avoid sexual re-  
lationships with men, at least for  
the time being.

People Change Slowly

I understand that people change  
slowly, and that's why I'm waiting  
and struggling with the people I  
love. But it also makes me very  
angry to constantly try to act dif-  
ferently than I feel—to be unable  
to really be the warm, open person I  
know I can be, because I know people  
don't understand that in the way  
that I mean it. So, I have to be  
cautious. It just isn't worth it  
anymore to make love with a man and  
have it end up the way it usually  
does—with a huge space between us  
afterwards—the cold feeling when I  
realize that suddenly the prelimin-  
ary closeness, the meaningful talk  
is over, because he's finally  

fucked me. And all of the mech-  
anisms I use to keep myself from  
dwelling on the shittiness of it  
all, my rationalizations, my over-  
looking of things he said and did—  
they don't work anymore. I like my-  
self too much now—I respect myself  
and care for myself and I WON'T LET  
IT HAPPEN ANYMORE! So, for now, al-  
though I will work on building hon-  
est relationships with men, I must  
be sure that the sexual aspect is  

as honest as the intellectual.

This brings up another question  
which I have done a lot of thinking  
about recently—that of bisexuality  
or gay relationships. As I become  
more conscious of my womanhood, it  
becomes more difficult for me to  
submit myself to a heterosexual re-  
lationship in which I am uncomfor-  
table or in which I see even the  
most subtle sexist patterns. But  
at the same time, my need for sex-  
ual contact, my sexual frustration,  
continues. And I find that the  
only people I can completely trust  
are the few women I have come to  
love. Because I know that they  
are honestly struggling with their  
sexuality and that they consider  
dealing with sexism (in themselves  
as well as in others) as an ongo-  

ing process that must be integra-  
ted into their everyday existence.  
So it becomes increasingly easy  
for me to think of making love to  
a woman—in fact, that doesn't  
seem at all threatening compared  
to becoming sexually involved with  
a man. It's quite a change for  
me. Until recently I hadn't even  
considered bisexuality, and now in  
many ways it is much more attrac-  
tive than heterosexuality. I'm  
not saying I will cease to be at-  
tracted to men, not at all; just  
that I am now feeling comfortable  
about physical relationships with  
women also.

So what does all this mean? I  
cannot at all see myself with-  
drawing from men completely. I  
live with men, my political work  
must necessarily involve and in-  
clude men. There are a few men  
whom I truly love and trust to a  
large degree. But I know that  
all men—and women too—have a  
thousand subtle, deep-seated  
feelings about each other—  
feelings that we cannot even iden-  
tify, that color our actions in  
ways we haven't even imagined.

And I feel that these feelings op-  
erate most strongly and subcon-  
sciously in those situations that  
are based in emotions and in those  
situations in which we have had  
the least practice at being open  
and honest. Sexual matters are  
the perfect examples of this.

Our society has taught us to be se-  
cretive and non-communicative  
about sex, let alone being embar-  
rassed and ashamed. We cannot  
talk to each other or learn from  
each other. We come together in  
bed and operate from two separate  
points—apart. How can we expect  

to communicate at that stage of the  
game, without any real preliminary  
honesty that deals specifically  
with sex? What I mean is that 99%  
of the time, men whom I sleep with  
are bound to be operating from a  
self-centered position—and nec-  
essarily so—because we probably  
have not been able to deal effec-  
tively with all of the quiet pri-  
vate thoughts, fears, and hang-ups  
we each have about our bodies and  
sex. So, men (and women, too) in  

a sexual relationship will be ac-  
ting out a lot of emotional, large-  
ly irrational responses. Where in-  
tellectually, many people can  
recognize and struggle with sexist  
feelings, in a sexual relationship,  
which is largely emotional, this  
might not be possible.

I am by no means advocating the  
increased intellectualization of  
personal relationships. I am an  
emotional person. What I mean is  
that we must really try to under-  
stand our emotions, our spontaneous  
responses to situations and people.  
And this is very hard—much more  
difficult than changing one's mind  
about a political matter or an in-  
tellectual decision. It goes to  
the very root of how we function as  
human beings, and how we relate to  
others. This is what I see as the  
true struggle—the radical struggle—  
the willingness to examine and deal  
with those very things that govern  
our every moment of existence. 13
