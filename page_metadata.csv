about us  
We felt some explanation of why we haven't published an issue since  
August was due. One reason is childcare which was work done by mo-  
thers and a few childless women with very little help from the rest  
of us. But after the last issue some women confronted the rest of  
the women's community about not doing enough in childcare and since  
then we have been busy beginning to share that work, helping at a  
new daycare center in town, doing outside childcare, & meeting with  
the non-biological mothers groups we formed to help deal with the  
fears and inadequacies that some of us felt about childcare. We have  
also been in an upheaval within the AIAW collective. In fall we had  
decided that our collective needed to be a tight one - a primary  
collective for all of us and that that would solve the internal mis-  
trust that was coming between us. Well, the process of tightening  
up the collective (dealing with how we all felt about the group,  
how we felt about working together) caused so much trauma, that we  
were forced to reconsider whether at this period in the community  
a tight closed collective was what we needed. There are a lot of  
women in the community that we trust and feel close to politically  
and personally, & although there are times when isolating yourselves  
is advantageous, our interests currently are much more wrapped up in  
the women's community here. We share the same struggles as other  
women in town. We finally reversed directions; calling a meeting of  
women in the community we felt we could work with to talk about po-  
litical directions, about what political work we each wanted to be  
doing, to ask for suggestions about the paper & talk about the idea  
for this issue. Since the last issue & that meeting several new  
groups have formed. There are various groups now revolving around  
the daycare center, a group of women printing an anthology of the two  
women's poetry readings that were held here, & a group planning to  
start a women's press. The membership of these groups overlaps a  
lot - overcommitment is something we can't seem to solve. There  
is so much we want to do. The AIAW collective has had some changes  
in membership during this time but still remains pretty small. We  
all feel that the paper is a good thing because it's the one thing  
we do that communicates with women who we don't know or work with.  
But it is difficult to find new women who we could work with who  
want to join a collective that is 2 yrs. old. The idea of a women's  
press is new and exciting & the paper is feeling its age. But most  
of us want it to continue & to somehow serve as a chronicle of the  
struggles of our community here - to somehow have them recorded, ex-  
plained, & analyzed. That's why this issue seems important since the  
struggle over childcare has touched almost everyone in the women's  
community. —

about this issue  
All of our time seemed to be consumed with childcare - doing it,  
worrying about doing it, worrying about not doing it, fighting over  
it & the meetings to decide what to do about the paper, what to  
publish, who to work with, seemed distant. Mothers and a few non-  
mothers had been doing an astounding amount of work on daycare for  
yrs. & lots of other women in the community were finally getting in-  
volved with childcare too, hassling about it, doing it, or not do-  
ing it & feeling guilty, or always doing it & feeling angry. It  
seemed so logical that what we published should reflect what was  
going on in the women’s community in Iowa City & much of what was/  
is going on here revolves around childcare. & everyone has something  
to say. If you put up a sign at the daycare center about anything,  
several scribbled answers, a graffiti dialogue, will appear in a  
couple days' time. Those of us working on the paper couldn't possi-  
bly present the whole issue of childcare as it concerns this com-  
munity. Except for two of us, we have just recently got our shit  
together & started working at it. None of us are mothers. We hung  
up announcements of this issue asking all the women in the commun-  
ity to write something & decided anything submitted would be print-  
ed. We kept copies of all articles handed in in a notebook at the  
daycare center so everyone could read them. A lot of the copy in this  
issue is a result of women responding to articles other women wrote.  
We think all the articles together present a pretty good picture of  
the issue of childcare as struggled over in the women's community  
in Iowa City & that's what we wanted to do. Our hope is that people  
will read the entire paper in sequence because it is the entirety of  
the issue that tells the story. What is and has happened here as re-  
gards childcare we think is useful to other women in other communi-  
ties but in some ways our struggles may be different. This community  
is small and on a whole pretty privileged, which does not make the  
lives of poor or working-class women here much easier. But being in  
a privileged university community does make some things more possi-  
ble. The university (great white father/employer/landlord/& master  
of us all) rents out huge bourgeois houses for $75 a month because of  
the pressure put on them & hard work done by women over a year ago,  
women in the community contribute financially to support the center  
because so many can afford to do so, & only two weeks after it start-  
ed it was full of toys, furniture, etc. It's true that some of that  
stuff was acquired from Goodwill dumpsters but even the dumpsters  
here are surrounded by goodies to snatch that you don't see around  
the dumpsters in Chicago or Boston. It was hard work to start the  
new daycare center but it was possible here. Low-income women and/or  
women in large cities may encounter struggles we glided through or  
avoided. Most women can't get beyond fighting for the physical fa-  
cility in which to start a center. But we think our experiences could  
be helpful & perhaps because our community crosses class lines and  
involves gay & straight women, a spectrum of community thought pre-  
sents a fairly accurate analysis of an issue that is real important  
in one way or another to all of us."

manifesto  

Mystification of Motherhood  

Motherhood is a mystique. It fails to separate the biological  
function of delivering a child from the social function of care  
and socialization. The sexual double standard reappears in child  
care: men threatened with the responsibility simply leave the  
scene - sometimes physically, sometimes mentally. The woman is  
left with the burden. Abandonment of children by women is seen  
as an unnatural, monstrous act. Men abandon children regularly  
without comparable social disapproval. After birth a child takes  
on a life of its own. Every function necessary for its survival  
and growth can be performed by any competent adult.  

On Her Own  

Those who assume the motherhood role are systematically excluded  
from employment and participation in any organization or institu-  
tion outside the home. These organizations, precisely because  
mothers are an insignificant portion of their membership, are un-  
aware of (or can ignore) the problems of child care. Thus, the  
exclusion of mothers is self-perpetuating.  

How are women with children kept outside the mainstream of society?  
Children need constant care. When the woman wants to do something  
else, a substitute must be found. Lack of free, 24-hour child  

care centers bind women to their children. This lack of facilities  
is most serious for women who care for very young children, or  

who cannot afford a babysitter, or who live alone. Even in co-op  
day care centers, where theoretically there exists an awareness of  
the need for child care to liberate women, membership has argued  
for the exclusion of families with diaper-aged children. Take-  
home pay for most jobs open to women, already low to begin with,  

is decimated by babysitting fees. Even when other adults are in  
the household, they seldom provide reliable relief.  

Another and more subtle way women are excluded is through sched-  
uling of activities. NUC, for example, (this organization is only  
typical...most follow the same pattern) arranged as many as four  
meetings a month at 2-tavern between five and seven on Friday  
evenings. Not only was no child care provided, but the time in-  
terfered with such routine tasks as providing meals. Those who  
can afford them argue for babysitters: one day care co-op scheduled  
six parent meetings with no provision for child care. With baby-  
sitting, both parents could attend; without it, only one. Obvious-  
ly those who hired babysitters acquired more control.  

This is a common syndrome which eventually restricts membership  
and control to childless, moneyed, and male people.  

Yet even when child care is made available for meetings, this is  
only a minimal attempt to rectify the problem. What of meetings  
and events scheduled late, or which run to late hours? The child-  
less membership does not get up with the children.  

Mothers can never participate fully when commitment requires  
energy beyond meeting attendance. ALL major time commitments  
exacerbate housekeeping and mothering tasks. When the woman has  

a job outside the home (dealing with welfare is a job) the problem  
is compounded.  

Finally, guilt paralyzes most women once they take a step away  
from home. Children cry, dishes collect, and she wonders if she  
is doing the right thing. If no one is there to say yes and give  
support, she will decide No on her own.

Nuclear Family I  

What keeps women tied to their biological children? The nuclear  
family. As long as it is the dominant social and economic unit,  
women will remain enslaved to the motherhood role. At present  
each female is personally responsible for the consequences of her  
biology. Each must negotiate the situation of pregnancy with a  
single male (father, lover, husband,) or a male institution (adop-  
tion agencies, welfare.)  

Pregnant women, if not fired outright, are discouraged from work-  
ing. Teachers in Iowa are retired at their fifth month. Then  
they are rehired (at one-third pay) as substitute teachers until  
delivery. Welfare women must often work for unscrupulous people  
at below minimum wage. The pay loss is compensation to the em-  
ployer for the ""favor"" he does her of not reporting the wages to  
the welfare department. The effect of such treatment is to drive  
women to be dependent on the greater economic security of males.  
She stays home while he goes out to earn. He is rewarded for  
working with money, and gains power and prestige. She engages in  
unpaid labor - averaging 99.6 hours per week.  

This workload is more than double that of the male.  
Nuclear Family II  

The woman left in her house with her children has no power to ne-  
gotiate the terms of her 99.6 hour job with other adults. Her  
singular responsibility for children leaves her in a position  
where she can be counted on to work when others prefer not to.  

The welfare of the children urges her to participate in this ar-  
rangement, though it is physically and emotionally damaging. The  
situation is not better in most collective living arrangements,  
where supposedly the child care is shared. The attitude remains  
that the mother has ultimate ""say"" and responsibility, with no op-  
tion to neglect ""her"" duties.  

Society provides one major alternative to marriage for economic  
security: remarriage. Even following the rules of the situation,  
this is difficult. Thus, alimony and ADC, pittance that they are,  
hold the survival line for families not headed by a male. Until  
all women have employment at decent pay, the begging, pleading,  
and threatening for this survival money will remain and grow as  

an economic institution.  

Economics  

Exclusionary practices result in loss of basic learned and social  
skills - consequently women lose the ability to earn an adequate  
salary. Projecting personal rather than social responsibility  
for children maintains the oppression of ALL women. All are  
treated as potential mothers who must be supported by men. This  
circumstance is an excuse to keep women out of career-producing  
areas of education, to employ them marginally, and to pay them  
minimally. Until economic realities are dealt with, demands of  
women will be met only under conditions prone to co-optation.  
Paid maternity leaves, 24-hour child care, salary supplements  
for child care, paid time off to work in day care co-ops: these  
demands fall in this category.  

Continual dependence on others results in loss of control over  
one's own life; little opportunity for growth; and a sense of fu-  
tility and valuelessness in activities. Gay mothers cannot and  
do not rely on men but on other women for support, when possible.  
Often gay mothers are forced to rely on welfare, and must ""pass”  
as straight.  

Even experience with and ability to care for children is consid-  
ered of little value. Pediatricians, specially trained teachers,  
child psychologists - all who generally have little experience  
outside a specialized area, are looked to as authorities on the  
subject.  

Nuclear family as economic  
and social unit  
+ Economic power invested  

in men  

= Women personally re-  
sponsible for children  

Who Owns Children?  

The nuclear family as the basic economic unit is the precondition  
for the belief that children belong exclusively to the family,  
that is, the property of the male and the responsibility of the  
female. In divorce cases, the child becomes the property of the  
state and is given over to the custody of the mother. As male  
property, both female and child take his name.  

Women are encouraged to measure their success in life through  
their responsibility for children. It is no accident many of  

them try to live vicariously through their children (or through  
the more powerful husband.) But if mothers fail in child rearing,  
the community also fails. It is the community, not the individual  
women, who reaps the benefits of a successfully “raised"" child.  
Societies need children to carry on culture and work. The male  
social order needs the fruits of, but does not want to tend, the —  
growth of children. Women are persuaded and coerced into the job.

While it is true that relating to children has its moments of  
ecstasy, it also has moments of hell. Mothers need support and  
aid from the community—especially from childless members of  
that community.  

Excuses  

Often childless adults will refuse to associate with children.  
""I just don't like being around them."" ""Sorry, I don't like  
children."" They may as well say they don't like peaches or  
prunes. This attitude relegates children to the status of ob-  
jects that can be taken or left. By comparison, such statements  
as yet fail to evoke emotional reactions, as would ""I don't like  
Blacks."" Children, however, ARE people in the same sense as any  
adult category.  

Like adults, children need warming up to. When a person has been  
dependent on another for a long time, as is generally the case  
with children, they are threatened by advances from new people.  
This situation must be struggled with among child, new person,  
and whoever was the focus of the child's dependency.  

Others realize, dimly or clearly, that child care is a drag.  
They simply don't want to give.  

""I'm no good at it.""  

""I'm so busy!""  

""I have more important things to do.""  

""I don't want to hear about it.""  

The underlying assumption here is that women choose to have child-  
ren and should want to take care of them.  

A Choice  

The ""choice"" attitude is based on consciousness of what child  
care involves. Many assume that because THEY at this time, know  
what child care involves, so did all the mothers, years ago, when  
they conceived. Therefore, they feel absolved from responsibility.  
Actually, it is largely a matter of chance which particular women  
conceive. Consciousness comes with changing social circumstances  
and experience. Biological ability to become pregnant usually pre-  
dates having much consciousness of any kind.  

Further, the attitude that women choose is both anti-feminist and  
class-biased. The ""choice"" depends on:  

- availability of general health and birth control information.  
- total effectiveness of birth control.  
- money for and access to abortions.  
- ability to project divorce, separation, and death.  
- time for and probability of contact with others conscious of  
  what child care involves.  
- support to withstand social pressure to conform to the mother-  
  hood role.  

All these factors decrease with class status.  

Problems of Daycare Co-ops  
How They Oppress Women  

Even in the most progressive of parent-controlled (none are yet con-  
trolled in any significant way by non-parents) day care co-ops,  
individual women definitely bear the consequences of their bio-  
logy. Volunteers, especially male volunteers, are hard to find  
and harder to keep. In families with two parents, women most  
often fill work requirements.  

Although child care is for women and children, decisions are not  
made by women. At general membership meetings, some women say  
nothing. At women's daycare meetings, these same women say plenty.  

Day care co-ops are white, middle-class, university affiliated.  
There are no child care centers for third-world, lower-class, or  
non-university women and children.  

Co-op membership has been reluctant to deal with issues of class-  
ism, racism, sexism, homosexism, and ageism. Consciousness  
raising, with its probing into personal values and activities,  
has been firmly resisted.  

The parent(s)-child unit remains the principal sub-unit of the  
co-ops. Childless persons are in a position of having to justify  
their actions to parents. Little is done to re-socialize child-  
ren. An illusion of dealing with sex roles is maintained by  
treating the children ""equally."" This means encouraging them to  
be passive. Once in school, boys will be expected to grow away  
from passivity, and girls will be reinforced in it. Re-socializa-  
tion of children cannot begin until adults deal thoroughly with  
their own socialization. This is a long way off.  

Women's Movement  

Child care is not yet considered a responsibility of the larger  
feminist community (gay and straight). Children who don't attend  
day care co-ops are left pretty much with their mothers. Day care  
was initiated as an important part of the women's movement, yet it  
is now virtually ignored by most non-mother feminists. Gay and  
straight women are both guilty. Many gay women have consciously  
made a choice not to have children as a part of their choice not  
to relate to men. This should not excuse them from child care  
responsibilities involving women. If any woman is not sharing  
child care, she contradicts herself as a feminist.  

The isolating quality of child care erodes a mother's ability to  
deal with other adults effectively. Losing self-confidence and  
speaking ability, she is easily intimidated by those with more  
practice.  

Women coming to the movement from a housewife/mother situation  
need encouragement as well as child care. Too often political  
women react with disgust at unsophisticated viewpoints. It is  
rare that any group of women considers child care for its member-  
ship an important initial concern.  

Child care problems must be dealt with by women at this point.  
This is not, however, the total solution. At such time when men  
deal with themselves and change (and as they do) child care will be  
their responsibility as well.  

Oppose Federally Sponsored Daycare  

Government sponsored and subsidized day care (as opposed to 24  
hour women and children controlled child care) maintains and in-  
creases exploitation. Females are ""liberated"" to work a low-  
paying job, but resume the mommy role once the job ends. The  
Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of the Nixon administration is such  
a carga work relief. Women using these centers are doubly bur-  
dened.  

Federally sponsored day care (already typified by Project Head  
Start) encourages the belief that biological mothers are respon-  
sible for biological children.  

Mandates  

A. Political priorities must include that 24 hour child care  
facilities be provided on a widespread basis, free of all cost,  
to women, particularly to women not yet served. (Non-white,  
lower/working-class, non-university.) All aspects of child care  
situations must be controlled by women and children.  

B. Collective living situations must be organized as a counter-  
institution to the nuclear family. Every adult must share equal  
responsibility for child care and housekeeping REGARDLESS OF COMMIT-  
MENT TO OTHER—INCLUDING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC—ACTIVITIES.  

A part of every living situation should be discussion by all lead-  
ing to consensual agreement on how the children are to be socialized.  
To fight the children-as-property attitude, and encourage viewing  
children as people, collective child care should integrate physical,  
social, and political welfare.  

Toward these goals we must engage in the following:  

1. CONSCIOUSNESS is a prerequisite to taking direct action. All  
CR groups must include mothers and must provide child care. Meet-  
ings must be scheduled at times convenient for mothers. Groups  
should not be sedentary but lead to a program of action. Every  
group member must learn practical aspects of child care and find  
a situation to apply what she learns. This means taking care of  
children on a STRUCTURED, reliable basis in a communal living  
arrangement, in a child care center, or in the home of a woman  
who needs more help.  

2. CR groups must work toward community programs which transcend  
and incorporate problems of individual women.  

- 24-hour centers  
- collective living arrangements  
- paid time off for child care  
- further formulating and disseminating an analysis of the child  
  care struggle  

""Childless"" persons already involved should do their own CR and  
take an aggressive role in this, especially in taking power and  
responsibility away from biological parents. Men have equal say,  
which is hardly equitable, since they have different interests from  
women and children.  

G Woman ? feb. '73 Z."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,4,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page004.txt,"what I wrote for this issue on daycare from

what I can remember about how

I saw it

In the spring of 1970, the Women's Liberation Front in Iowa City
split into small cells along interest/project lines. At that time
I saw the daycare cell as one of many projects people could choose
to do but not as something that everyone should be doing. I chose
to work in the publications collective and the publishing of Ain't
I A Woman? became my priority. I sort of understood -- but not
really -- that when we split into project groups that some of the
women who chose daycare did so out of political necessity since
they had children and needed daycare. Who knows what their choice
would have been had daycare been available to them. Had I had
children of my own I too would have been in the daycare cell --
probably never allowing myself to think about whether I wanted to
work on a paper.

I did start working one morning a week at Dum Dum, the first
daycare center that the WL daycare cell organized and opened. It
was a good experience for me learning that I did in fact like kids,
that none of the kids died while I was working, that I could learn
to change a diaper. I had never been around kids before and cer-
tainly didn't completely overcome my fears, but it was a beginning.

It was just around that time that I had broken up with my hus-
band and admitted to myself that I was gay. My hatred and resent-
ment toward men was still sizzling and I found working with men
(who were recruited to volunteer at the center) hard and often of-
fensive. I saw no reason at that time (and still don't) to struggle
with men in most instances, but I understand now how women who have
children to take care of don't see that option (to not relate or
struggle with men) as a viable one even if they'd like to. In a
sense the men seemed to have incredible power in the situation
since the women needed their help and were willing to give them
equal control and struggle with them to get it. Most of the women
involved were heterosexual and had no intention of cutting men out
of their lives, but even the few women who did have that intention
didn't think women could do it themselves -- could or would take
care of each other including each other's children. At that time
I saw that as straight male-identified thinking and lack of trust
in other women. Now I think I understand better why women with
children didn't trust those of us who had no children -- who had
other political priorities, who at the most did a half day of day-
care a week and had the option not to do any.

Still there were many disagreements I had with the women who
worked in daycare. Mostly they were over separatism and over the
fact that even the women who were separatists working in daycare
did not support me and other women who were separatist or gay, and
pandered to the men and women who used the center. They believed
in community control and it seemed like any sacrifice in politics
was acceptable to that end. I don't see any way to simply describe
what I mean by community control. In this case the center was run
by general meetings of parents and volunteers. I also can't spell
out exactly how I think it should have been run. There is no op-
posite to community control, really. My complaint about it is that
there are so many contradictions between volunteers and parents
and that the way those contradictions generally get worked out is
by majority rule rather than consensus (which I think is more
right). Also even though I think people using a service and people
working there should control it, I don't think that means they have
the right to oppress anyone. Like an all-white community doesn't
have the right to be racist under the guise of community control--
like parents don't have the right to be homosexist under the guise
of community control of a daycare center.

It was during that first summer that the center was opened that
the women in daycare and the women putting out the paper clashed.
The daycare center wanted to put out some recruiting literature
to hand out at registration here at the university. AIAW offered
to give them the centerfold of the paper which could be removed
from the paper and we offered to cover the cost. However, we wouldn't
change any of our policies -- one of which was no males writ-
ing in the paper. The daycare women wanted to include reactions
from male volunteers and thought our policy was wrong. From then
on the disagreements between the paper and daycare only got worse.

In thinking back to that time I still feel my disagreements with
the daycare cell were political and valid. At that time a feminist
community was just beginning to grow and the women building it by
attempting to live independently with other women, to not relate
to men, should have been given respect and support. There never
seemed a valid reason to reject our complaints about daycare while
making concessions to male volunteers. And the arguments from the
daycare cell about the need of the parents I could never see since
the center was pretty freaky and university oriented. It all seemed
pretty middle-class to me. Mostly the disagreements we had kept me
from ever seeing the other (perhaps real) issue of daycare which
was that those of us who did not have children of our own had a re-
sponsibility to share the work involved in taking care of children.
We talked about a feminist controlled center at that time but never
did anything about it. I stopped working at the center completely
by mid-winter and pretty much didn't relate to any women who
worked in daycare except two women who lived in my living collec-
tive. One of those women later moved in with a woman, her husband

page Vol. 3

and three kids. I never could completely understand how she could
stand living in such a heterosexual scene but I do understand now
how much help she gave in taking care of the children. I know I
could never do anything like that and though I better understand now
how much help a biological mother needs and how I have a responsi-
bility to share the work involved, I still don't feel that it is
fair to expect a gay woman to live in a heterosexual environment
to fulfill that responsibility. But then I no longer think it's
fair that any biological mother be left alone with the responsibi-
lity for her children either. At that time as I said I didn't re-
late to any biological mothers, children, or even women working in
daycare. I think there are all kinds of walls and dividers blocking
single (especially gay) women from relating to children. For a
while this didn't bother me much at all and I still didn't feel I
had a responsibility to do daycare in addition to my other politi-
cal priorities. But eventually I started feeling that I wanted to
relate to children but relating to them always seemed to mean being
with men or heterosexual couples.

Somehow this changed somewhat. Maybe it was due to more women
becoming gay and more women becoming part of or relating to the
women's community here -- some of whom had children of their own
and some of whom had been doing childcare for some time. Through
these women and through my friend who was living with three child-
ren, I started being around children more and in situations where
I felt I could be myself and be honest with them -- instead of be-
ing uptight about my politics or gayness slipping out in front of
parents or men.

Just this summer a small group of parents and volunteers (mostly
gay) split from one of the daycare centers in town over its sex-
ism and homosexism. They began planning a feminist controlled day-
care center. When I was called about it, I was surprised at how ex-
cited I was. And I must have changed some by that time in terms of
my consciousness of the daycare issue because even though I still
wanted to have a political group or project that was my priority
and I was pretty sure that I didn't want that to be daycare, I was
willing and thought it right that daycare time be demanded of me.
The center was started in temporary housing to provide daycare for
the children that had been left without it after the split and was
still very much in the planning stages when I left town for two
weeks. When I came back the concept of the center had changed. It
was now a center to serve low-income and working-class women. That
really disappointed me a lot. Why it disappointed me is a whole
other article but real simplistically: 1) being working class my-
self I felt that since most of the women involved in starting it
were middle class that it was presumptuous at best to think they
could supply a service to low-income and working-class mothers that
would not be exploitative and 2) I was afraid of the sacrifices
that would be made regarding feminism -- there was talk at that
time of gay women having to shuffle at the new center. However since
the center was still to have only women working there, I intended
to be active. I also saw the center as involving many women in the
women's community and being a good way to struggle over the issue
of daycare."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,5,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page005.txt,"Also when I came back to town the women who had been most in-
volved with the center were angry as all hell and ready to kick ass
over the fact that many women did not do enough daycare and/or were
irresponsible about the daycare that they did do or said they'd do. The
real gut of the issue I think, where the anger came from, was the
anger of women who were responsible for children (in most cases
their own) toward those of us who had the option of doing daycare
or not -- who had not been much of any help in the past and who at
the most had a pretty superficial understanding of childcare.

The first general meeting that was called of all volunteers and
women who wanted to work in the center was almost totally consumed
with putting all of us who are not mothers and who hadn't done much
daycare up against the wall. The meeting began with two women leav-
ing to go get another woman who hadn't shown up and eventually
physically fighting with her, and from there on the meeting only
got worse with the issues of daycare, class, violence versus non-
violence, getting thrown around in confusing and sometimes really
incorrect ways.

It wasn't the first time I really disagreed with what was com-
ing down over daycare and it wasn't the first time I felt really
offended by some of what mothers were saying in regard to gayness
and class. People were so angry over other people's laxness on day-
care and so self-righteous about it that much was thrown out that
I found offensive to gay women and particularly to working class
women. It was really hard for me to listen to middle class women
(who had children) tell me (working class) about the needs of work-
ing class mothers since I felt there was a lot of classist stereo-
typing expressed in their ideas. It was also hard to listen to
middle class women talk to me about how privileged I was because
I didn't have children.

The women who were planning the center issued financial state-
ments to be filled out and used as a basis for taxing the volun-
teers and thus financially supporting the center. I found that
pretty threatening since there was an atmosphere of classifying

women without children as privileged in regard to childcare with-
out being sensitive to their class backgrounds or other oppressions
they may have suffered. In the same way, mothers were labeled op-
pressed seemingly without regard to their class positions. However
it was the first time I knew I could not correctly choose to not
deal with daycare because I disagreed with the politics of the
women involved. Despite how incorrect in some ways I think the
anger was directed and used, it was that anger and being put up
against the wall that forced me to deal with an issue I had ignored

for so long.

The daycare issue in this town has always been complex, but in
the past when contradictions developed between people, the child-
less women would split. I think our political consciousness has
grown higher now and does not allow us that option. Doing child-
care is now respected political work that is expected of women
active in the women's community. There is social pressure put on
women who refuse to do childcare and this, I think, is as it should
be. The complexities of the issue have increased by the number of
women who have to deal with it and the contradictions between gay
women and straight women, mothers and non-mothers, women of dif-
ferent classes.

I don't see any easy direction -- I know I'm not sure of what
is the absolute way of dealing with it. Right now there are hassles
between the needs of mothers and the needs of gay women who work
in the center. The only way I know to deal with that is to deal
with it -- not ignore it and for all of us to be sensitive to
everyone's needs and oppressions. As regards childcare I think
mothers must be listened to because it is they who best understand
the issue and work involved. I realize that what I say could
sound like wishy-washy liberalism -- everybody should be listened
to, etc. But I think we have long passed the stage of seeing things
in simplistic contradictions and as regards contradictions between
women (lesbian/straight, working class/middle class, etc.) I don't see
that any contradiction is primary or any oppression is primary.

I am only sure that no oppression should be ignored.

~.d million memories.
that make me sick...

When I was eleven I started babysitting.
I enjoyed it and children liked me; often
they would come and ask me to ""babysit
them"" without their parents’ knowledge. I
was tall, skinny, and not very articulate
(my mother was beautiful and intelligent
and never could understand how she'd gotten
this dumb and ugly daughter) but child-
ren didn't seem to mind, and I didn't care
that they were little and not very articu-
late.

By 18 I had filled out enough to fit the
emaciated vogue and my mother, being a
realist, often told me I'd better get
married before I lost my figure and couldn't
find a husband. I was just 19 when I
followed that advice to her relief.

In the next eight years my husband some-
how taught me that my whole worth was in
my body which began to betray me with age
and pregnancies. I remember wanting my
first child, but I also remember crying
and freaking out, wanting to leave my hus-
band, wanting to stay pregnant and not
have the baby, wanting not to be pregnant,
angry screaming sessions when I would
threaten to leave knowing that I had no-
where to go, no way to get there, and no
money that was not his. Money was what
kept me with him, and guilt, and a feeling
that I was a rotten person and all these
feelings were evil, and anyway I was cer-
tainly not capable of taking care of my-
self. I used to wish he would die and
fantasize about how I should react when
they came and told me.

For years I stayed up until two and
three a.m. then crept quietly into bed
trying not to squeak the springs so he
wouldn't wake up, and when he did lying
quietly, responding as little as possible,
trying to keep my mind on other things,
feeling inadequate and not wanting him to
know. At first it did hurt to have sex; after
the children it was mostly just degrading
and a time-consuming bore which kept me
from getting enough sleep. I was always
tired.

Our second child was an unfortunate
mistake. By this time I knew enough to be
terrified of giving birth, and of having
the responsibility of children; and my
husband was in Viet Nam doing his macho
adventurer, and at that time glorified,
thing; so I was alone with this one.

Smiling male lab technicians gave me the
good news that I was indeed five months

pregnant and were shocked when I started
crying and couldn't stop (after all I was
married!). I felt like a selfish sub-hu-
man. I cried every night for months and

it was my first child who often climbed
into bed with me patting my back saying
“don't cry mommy."" I felt guilty for that
too. That child was my only reason for
surviving. We, together, dealt with what
was happening without words, without ex-
planations -- with hugs and smiles and rag-
ing screaming tantrums. I began to deny the
pregnancy and in that way with the support
of a two-year-old I coped. But when the
undeniable happened and the new baby came

I didn't love her, I didn't even like her,
I didn't want her. And now a new problem
set in. You can't go anywhere with a tod-
dler, an infant, two diaper bags and a
purse. About once a week my mother babysat
(more often if I begged) and I had enough
money for a babysitter once in a while,
other than that I took out the garbage and
talked to the mailman. Three months later
my husband arrived home, in a wheelchair,
having been seriously injured in Viet Nam.
So now I had to push him around and wait
on him as well as always be cheerful so as
not to make him feel depressed. The only
thing he could do was have sex. The first month
he was out of the hospital I had to bundle
up the children and drive him to the hospi-
tal for shots every six hours.

I began to go through depressions that
lasted for months, only getting drunk
helped, which I did as often as possible. I
thought constantly of death, the look he'd
have when he found me, what others would
feel -- bad, I hoped. I began to resent,
hate the children. My daughter was into
smearing the walls of her room with shit
once or twice a day, she screamed, fussed,
cried, or was into something all the time
and was generally unpleasant to be around.
My best escape was sleep, but with the
children I couldn't sleep in the daytime,
and at night there was my husband to con-
tend with. I didn't even think about leav-
ing at first; all that talk about broken
homes and juvenile delinquents and how
could I support two children and what I
owed everybody else, especially the child-
ren and my duty and responsibility, somehow
I was stuck forever and it was their fault.
I had no friends; married women seldom do,
their husbands carefully see to that. I had
only him to talk to and over the years I

had learned that he was always right in the
end until I could barely formulate an opin-
ion much less make a decision; to say what
I thought was to have it changed into some-
thing else until I only thought his thoughts
(that still happens, after all those years
it’s hard to change). It took me three
months to decide to leave, then it was six
more months before I left, six months of

me begging for money and him being cool and
logical and reasonable, telling me how I
couldn't manage and me explaining that it
wasn't him but me, that I was all messed up
and needed a little time away to get it to-
gether, then I'd surely be back if he'd
only be patient. He let me go out of fear

I think, fear that I would kill myself or
go insane. I had the nerve to leave because
of that same fear.

The next two years were almost as bad as
before with me hoping for an empty mail
box rather than the guilt of letters from
him and well-meaning friends and family al-
ways telling me why I should return (""think
of the children""), him being sick from his
Viet Nam injuries, he was going to die he
kept saying, he was only asking for two
years of my life, it was the least I could
do. And there were the other men each worse
than the last. In the end I felt like a
headless body (""shut up and get in bed"").

I was lucky, I was only forcibly raped
once.

It goes on and on, a million memories
that make me feel sick, screaming at the
children until my head ached then panicked
with guilt; having sex with man after man
that I disliked, it was enough if they
would talk to me and would put up with the
children; trying to teach the kids to be
polite and quiet and not scare people away.

But I don't like people touching me now.
And I have little patience with children.
I'm terrified of the gay women's community
because there seems to be no place to go
if I can't be there. But women start tell-
ing each other what mothers would want as
though I don't exist, or talking and tell-
ing me I'm wrong about everything I think
or feel and it doesn't matter if I'm right
or wrong and I'm probably wrong, but I'm
starting to understand where I've been and
what it's done to me. I don't think you
realize that you can't erase those years
simply by doing childcare now. That being
a mother like every other form of oppres-
sion, goes deeper than the physical reality."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,6,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page006.txt,"DIALOG BETWEEN OLD GAYS

I never wanted a child, or wanted anything to do with children.  
After doing babysitting in my early teens I had nothing more to do  
with children until this last year. I've gone through really rad-  
ical changes in my attitude about children: from being threatened  
about how little control I have with their candidness to being less  
authoritarian and giving them more control over activities, trying  
to be non-age chauvinistic, from feeling they are helpless, puzzl-  
ing and fragile to encouraging them to be independent, self-suffi-  
cient and tough, listening to their ideas and respecting children.

I shared the attitude held by many lesbians who have been gay  
for years--why should I do any childcare? Children come from  
heterosexual relationships that not only oppress me, but socially  
ostracize me when the opportunity comes up. Children cannot be  
entrusted to homosexuals because we are perverted, say the straight  
parents, to the point of keeping us from teaching and any occupation  
dealing with children, so why, now, should I do childcare for women  
with children, whether they are poor, don't have husbands, or even  
if they are gay? I'm gay and with that I accept not having child-  
ren, I do not want children, and I do not want to have anything to  
do with children.

Where I'm coming from about kids is liking them O.K. but just  
not having much contact with them. My only brother was one year  
younger and my only younger cousins lived in Minneapolis and came  
down once a year. I didn't like to babysit because the thought of  
the parents coming home drunk made me cringe.

When I was a teenager everyone reinforced my behavior with kids  
and told me I was good with them. But because my interactions were  
so far between, I never have had much confidence in my ability to  
come through in a pinch and calm a crying child. I'm only just  
most recently realizing that I can meet children's needs, like  
Saturday night when I did overnight care at Sparky, I got them  
all to bed without crying just by kissing them. But still I have  
real problems with getting angry when a child is crying for no rea-  
son that I can see. Sometimes I can't control it and it scares me.

I didn't like babysitting either, but I did it because I always  
needed money. And, yes, the parents were usually offensive when  
they came home drunk: Because of that I've come to realize that  

part of my not wanting to be around children has been environmental.

Straight households are oppressive to everyone including the child  
and the babysitter. Children in this situation have caused me a  
lot of grief. They have called me names in front of their parents,  
they've asked me if I am a man, and they've even told their parents  
that I had a girlfriend over. Statements like that aren't so un-  
comfortable for me in the environment I'm in now, but because of  
the children's honest and eager observations in the straight home  

I usually had to make some witty and self-put-downish comment to  
appease both child and onlooking parent. These circumstances were  
great reinforcers of the self-hatred most gay people live with in  
this stiflingly straight society. The flaw in my resentment is  
that it was directed toward the children involved rather than ag-  
ainst the oppressive straight, nuclear family.

Castigation of gayness is induced by straight society onto not  
only gay people but children who will carry on that attitude. It  
is self-contemptuous of me to promote anti-homosexuality when doing  
childcare, and I will not do it. When I babysat in the straight  
environment that is what I had to do, and that is one reason why I  
no longer wanted to do childcare in any capacity. In such an envi-  
ronment a gay person has no stake in the care and development of  
any child--not even her own--and is forced to contribute to her  
future oppression. This society brainwashes children to hate and  
adopt biases against people for no direct reason other than that's  
what the parents were taught. I refuse to promote sexist, homo-  
sexist, racist and fascist attitudes in children I do childcare  
with because it is ultimately self-destructive to me and the soci-  
ety I want to live in.

I agree with you. There are many real and material reasons why  
gay women don't seek out children to relate to. Over the years  
gay people have been burned, castrated, hung, jailed and beaten  
for even looking crossways at children. And if those consequences  
seemed far removed to me, very few times have I related to a child  
since I've been gay without looking over my shoulder to see who's  
watching and what they're thinking. Society has planted the seed  
and I carry it and torture myself.

Volume 3 Numbers 243

One of society's most basic and powerful psychological weapons  
against gay women is that living with a woman means you're cutting  
yourself off from having children. Most gay women have to deal  
with that within themselves very early. If it is overcome, it's  
done in varied ways, but certainly one defense is to reject child-  
ren and motherhood as anything valuable.

I have also felt paranoid constantly with children because of  
some of the things you pointed out. But another problem for me  
has been even accepting my responsibility to children because I am  
not ultimately responsible for them and because of my painful inter-  
actions with them in the past. Also, because of my isolation in a  
rural, extended-family type community I was not early aware of the  
many women who have to raise their children alone, I was not aware  
of the difference class makes in childcare responsibility even if a  
husband is present, and I didn't take into account that all women  
are socialized to be child-bearers and that I was casting off that  
role earlier than many women would. I now accept responsibility  
for children because they are people who need to be cared for be-  
cause of their age and because in primary parent/child relation-  
ships the daily child-rearing falls on the mother's shoulders.  
Women with children need to be freed from that.

My transition to taking responsibility for other women's child-  
ren hasn't been smooth. The glaring facts remain unresolved and  
undealt with that: 1. I have qualms about doing childcare for  
women who relate to men exclusively because those relationships  
create more space for heterosexuality and do nothing to lessen my  
oppression as a gay woman. 2. I question the criticism from mid-  
dle-class gay women with children whose approach it is that I am  
privileged not to have children and responsibility for them because  
where they are coming from is a doubly privileged position from  
mine: their money could buy childcare services and their hetero-  
sexual relationship was socially sanctioned. 3. I resent being  
told by new gay women with children that my conscious decision at  
the age of 13 that now gives me more time than a woman with child-  

ren, is a privilege because the ensuing, daily oppression by  
straights from my decision was certainly a long unrewarded and  
painful struggle--while heterosexual standards rewarded marriage  
and children.

I understand the unsmoothness of the transition. I have simi-  
lar qualms, but I think the problems between gay women and mothers  
are caused by oversimplification on both sides.

Your number one in the last paragraph doesn't fall into that  
category, however. I have the same gut level feeling when I think  
about doing daycare for heterosexual women. But we are assuming  
that struggle within them isn't going on. Last night at the Sparky  
general meeting which 3 heterosexual mothers came to, I saw them  
struggling with and realizing why we as gay women did not want sin-  
gle men parents in Sparky--and how it was oppressive to us. The  
other thing I always want to be careful of is to not rule on other  
women's sexuality or make my responsibility to them contingent on  
their being gay.

I know it's hard to listen to the anger of a mother when she's  
middle class and more privileged than you in some ways. If it were  
a working-class mother you could hear the anger and oppression much  
more clearly, but it's there in a middle-class mother also. (A lot  
of times I catch myself playing ""More oppressed than thou"" and have  
to stop and make myself listen to what the woman is angry about.)  
The oppression of motherhood hits both classes.

Not so long ago you both as gay women were all real self-right-  
eous in putting other women up against the wall about dealing with  
our homophobia. You sometimes made mistakes and were blind to the  
other oppressions that some straight women suffered. Still in the  
long run your confronting straight women was a good thing. It help-  
ed a lot of gay women, gave them space and pride and it also developed  
the consciousness of the whole movement. Perhaps the anger of  
mothers will do the same. I just think we should give them the re-  

spect we want given to gay women."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,7,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page007.txt,"I cringe when I am told I am privileged not to have children.  
It's not a privilege--it's the logical outcome of my way of life  
which is fought against and sneered at in this society. If mothers  
talk privilege like that to gay women I'll bet they'll get a lot of  
women who feel they have been deprived of relating to children  
against their will. And there it is, not a matter of privilege,  
but two different types of people who are oppressed in different  
ways. It's too simple to say we are privileged because in very  
basic ways we are not.  

So why does there seem to be this ""more oppressed than thou""  
bargaining with oppressions? Last night at the Sparky general  
meeting a working-class gay woman got mad at a middle-class gay  
mother about class and the mother got mad at the other about child-  
care. They ended their exchange with one saying ""I'm sick of hav-  
ing you not listen to me about class."" To which the mother replied  
""I'm sick of having you not listen to me about the oppression of  
children and mothers."" The mention of one oppression should not be  
used as a defense against having to deal with another's oppression.  

But this goes on a lot. It's because of the peculiar context in  
which oppression is seen within a community whose members all have  
been maimed by society in one way or another. In order to overcome  
the psychological effects of oppression you must become angry and  
realize that instead of there being something wrong with you, there  
is something wrong with society and those oppressing you. Once you  
do that you can respect yourself. Others also, if they are urged to  
consciousness about gayness, class, or motherhood, come to respect  
what you have done and what you say politically. And that is how  
oppression becomes a source of community respect instead of a  
scourge.  

Because this is a political community and politics has to do  
with oppression, oppression and good politics are basic sources of  
respect. They, therefore, take on additional social and emotional  
meaning and that's where things get messed up. Oppression almost  
becomes a commodity that people bargain for because their egos are  
tied up in there somewhere.  

""More oppressed than thou"" is an offshoot of this. It says  
""I'm more oppressed than you are so I don't have to deal with your  
problem."" We must begin examining our motives when we are defens-  
ive in such a way about someone else's oppression.  

The following was an open letter from a mother written to women in the community who had  

I definitely agree that all of us in the Iowa City Women's  
Community have to deal with others' oppression by watching how we  
have been oppressed affect how we relate to other women and vice  
versa. I don’t think that mutual respect for each other's oppres-  
sions is enough without some attempt by all to help equalize our  
situations. I've never seen middle-class women do much about how  
they oppress working-class women by their privileged background  
that gives them many, many advantages working-class women never had  
and never can have. Class differences change the degree to which a  
mother or a gay woman is oppressed and I want middle-class women  
in this community to start dealing with that fact and listening to  
working-class women's suggestions on how they can change at the  
same time as we're listening to them about gayness or motherhood.  

Getting back to childcare more specifically, though, the cir-  
cumstances seem to be that women who have had children and are  
raising them are defensive about women who haven't had children  
beginning to share responsibility for children even to the point of  
doing it without the mother. It's true that it isn't that easy to  
erase the oppression of motherhood, but women without children are  
trying to help.  

I can relate to mothers' defensiveness about women without  
children suddenly taking responsibility for children because of the  
similarity between that and the old gay/new gay situation. After  
having been gay for 14 years myself there are now many, many women who  
are gay and share some experiences, but who will never feel the op-  
pressive atmosphere of isolation, condescension, fear of exposure,  
and loneliness that I lived with until the gay women's community  
blossomed in Iowa City within the last two years, and there are  
times when I resent newer gay women talking about the oppression of  
gayness because they've never gone through and never will need to  
experience what long-time gay women have had to go through. In the  
same way women just recently sharing childcare responsibilities  
will never be as oppressed by isolation, decision-making, lack of  
time for themselves, etc., that mothers have experienced. And all  
these reasons validate some lack of trust.  

The whole point of sharing childcare responsibilities for me is  
to equalize the burden that keeps some women busy 24 hours a day.  

But at the same time an exchange of consideration, and attempts at  
respect from learning other women's needs, must be happening or the  
""more oppressed than thou"" syndrome will never end.  

You have all the options--whether to take  
childcare seriously or not. You get so  
pissed off when people don’t show up to  
work daycare and you're ""stuck there."" Yes,  
you should be pissed but many women with  
children in this town are ""stuck there"" 24  
hours a day, seven days a week and no one  
shows up to relieve her. It's so fucking  
difficult for you to be inconvenienced.  
Well, women with children are often incon-  
venienced 24 hours a day. You say you are  
so busy--you don't have time, or damned  
little time. You work full time--so fucking  
what? Women with kids do it every day and  
do childcare the other 16 hours every day.  
You can't even find time to do it once a  
week. You think childcare ends at 5:30.  

You say you have other time commitments.  
You have that option. Perhaps AIAW could  
be put out by working-class women with  
children if they weren't stuck home with  
their kids. But you say you're too busy!  
What shit.  

Your amount of commitment to childcare  
seems to vary according to your social  
life. If you're into a relationship, it  
often causes you to fuck off childcare re-  
sponsibilities. You have that option.  
Women with children don't. You say you're  
freaking out--having personal hassles. You  
have the option to spend two weeks freaking  
out, unable to do anything else (namely  
childcare). Women with children have to  
freak out about the responsibilities of  
childcare.  

You never think of having relationships  
with children. You might get off on them  
occasionally when you have to do childcare  
but you never ask them to do something that  
could be fun for both of you--you always  
ask another adult.  

When you're with someone constantly, it  
usually puts a strain on your relationship.  
Low-income women with children have no op-  
tions about being with their kids constant-  
ly.  

You stay up all night having a good time  
with adults and when you come to daycare,  
you fall asleep or are just too burned out  
to relate to the kids. You're ripping off  
the kids. It's also an option that women  
with kids don't have. Women with kids  
can't say ""I'll stay up late and have a  
good time 'cause I can do my 4 hours child-  

care tomorrow and go home and take a nap.""  
It's childcare 24 hours a day all the time.  

About My Own Kids  

You expect me to bring them (or be respon-  
sible for finding a ride) to and from day-  
care. Why can't you? You ask me if I'm  
going to bring them to the dance/party or  
whatever, 'cause you'd really like to see  
them. Why can't you take them?  

Kids have to eat three meals a day. One's  
at daycare...where do you think the other  
two come from every fucking day? You  
think they look real nice in butch drag.  

Do you ever buy or get them clothes? You  
think kids need shoes. Who paid $7.00 a  
pair for them? And when I think that I get  
more help with my kids than any other woman  
with kids that I know, it makes me sick to  
hear your excuses. I say you'd better  
think a long time about the lip service  

you give to childcare 'cause what's getting  
done in this town by women without kids  

for women with kids is piddly. It's only  
at your convenience that you relate to kids  
and that ain't enough.  

Additions while talking with two other  
mothers  

1. You don't have to keep your house  
straightened, there are no kids around to  
trip over junk or eat things off the floor.  
And, if you want to clean house, it will  
stay clean for more than five minutes be-  
cause there's no kids to mess it up.  

2. Some landlords won't rent to people  
with kids--especially single women with kids.  

3. You can choose what political activ-  
ities you want to be involved in. Women  
with kids have to choose daycare or there  
won't be daycare. You can put childcare  
on a charity basis.  

4. You have the option to do childcare  
only when  

a. you're in the mood  

b. you like the particular children  

c. all the supplies are provided by  
the parent  

d. the kids are the age you get off on  

e. there's only one kid  

f. you like the mother  

g. the mothers give you ego-building  

thanks  

5. You can be ignorant of legalities  
concerning kids (custody etc.) and rely on  
the mother ""to fill you in.""  

6. You can go anywhere on a moment's  
notice.  

7. You can make definite plans and then  
not have to figure out childcare arrange-  
ments.  

8. You can go to social events and only  
think about refreshments for yourself. You  
can have parties and only think about ac-  
commodating adults.  

9. You can plan your money around one  
person.  

10. You can carry around an appointment  
book and be sure of meeting all of them.  

11. You have the option to think all this  
stuff is picky.  

12. You only have to worry about winter  
clothes and other necessities (like food)  
for yourself.  

13. You don’t have to spend money/space  
on cribs, toys, etc.  

14. You can have a house full of neat  
shit that kids would wreak.  

15. You can rely on mothers to get kids  
to and from you if it is just as much of a  
hassle for both of you.  

16. You can avoid or reduce the amount of  
energy spent dealing with schools, doctors,  
welfare, and grandparents.  

17. Basically, you have two options that  
women with children don't have:  

1. to not relate to children  
2. to relate to children only under  
certain conditions."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,8,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page008.txt,"Think about what it would be like to live my life

This may take the form of an open letter to all non-biological
mothers, those of you who refer to yourselves as such and to those
of you who are not doing much childcare, for some reason or another.
I would like to start out by saying that we need help! Having a
child is a never-ending responsibility. It is too often a very fine
thing, but it is often a burden too. Mothers are accused of not
trusting you enough and of trying to exercise too much control over
our children. I want to trust you implicitly but it has been my
experience that surrogate parents will always split for one reason
or another. I can only trust you so far when I realize that your
commitment is only good as long as you are living with me or as
long as you live within geographic proximity. For this reason, I
am learning to take all the help I can while I can get it, but
taking long-term commitments lightly.

I don't want complete control of my child but I know that I
will be the only person who will be consistently responsible for
his life for the next 15 years, so I have to retain at least 30%
control. Oftentimes it is 90%. It is unfortunate that adults do
have to exercise control over children, but it is unnecessary to go
into reasons for this. Even when I've lived with two other people
who are sharing responsibility, I find that I'm the only one who
cares if he spends too much time at daycare. Children burn out on
one place and one group of people also. I'm the only one who washes
his hair or cleans up his room. As a mother I am forced into the

position of coordinator of his care. I'm the one who has to see
that some adult is with him at all times. Oftentimes my only re-
sources for childcare are other biological mothers who shouldn't
be asked to take on additional responsibility. These are the peo-
ple, however, who understand and share my problems. We are forced
to help each other for lack of non-parents taking responsibility.
Please do childcare for us and don't ask us to shuffle for it,
to always have to ask and to be sure to say please and thank you.
Call me and ask if you can take him that night or just go pick
him up from daycare and leave me a note on the blackboard. Show
me I can depend on you. I will burn out. Without your help I
will soon be looking for a divorce from my child. Also please
don't choose female children over males. We couldn't determine
the sex of our children. Mothers of male children need even more
help. It is impossible for me to reinforce non-sexist behavior
alone. This may sound very preachy and sometimes bitter. That
wasn't my intention but it might serve to demonstrate my situation,
and those of most other mothers that I have talked to. I should
add that there are a whole lot of women in this community who are
doing a fantastic job as non-biological mothers but there are too
many of you who do little childcare because you have other commit-
ments. Well I have other commitments too and there is a lot more I
want to do that I don't have the time for. Think about what it
would be like to live my life.

""Et cum spiritu tuo.

* “and with your spirit.”

I am a gay working-class non-biological
mother. I grew up as the oldest in a
Catholic family of eleven, and have done
childcare duties at home and for other
people for eleven years as a babysitter,
substitute parent (both mine work full-
time), and daycare worker. I do regular
childcare, with the help of my living
collective, outside of daycare for four
children from the women's community, plus
irregularly for several others. I have
a commitment to three ""regulars"" I con-
sider to be ongoing until it's not needed
anymore, and want to maintain close rela-
tionships with them for as long as possible.
I guess that hinges on their agreement to
that when they're all old enough to make
a choice, as I have done. My involvement
with all three of them came about through
daycare, before I knew their mothers, or
had specific friendships with them. This
situation has sort of free meaning to me
that I value. I do not want my relations
with these kids to be controlled by their
parents or the people they live with.
About ten children were walked out of my
life over a political split between adults
in a center here this year, and the thought
of it happening again is frightening. I
love them a lot and have as much right
and responsibility as a parent - and I am

determined not to fuck that off. I do
think that some agreements exist
between biological/legal parents and us

others, but I think it's wrong for rela-
tionships between adults to dictate or

control relationships between adults and
kids. It's unfair and fucked-up for all.

Childcare has been a primary commitment
for me since before the beginnings of my
feminist politics and involvement in the
Iowa City women's community. I came to
this town in 1969 to go to college on the
typically inadequate crumbs that the Uni-
versity and government dole out to lower-
class kids trying to ""better themselves""
and class climb. It's a burn and an in-
sult -- but that's another story, right?
Bullshit...

Anyway, after my dazzling freshman year
and another stint at home, DOING 24 HOUR
CHILDCARE FOR A WORKING CLASS WOMAN, I
moved to Iowa City permanently and delib -
erately started working in a daycare cen-
ter because I needed to find a place to
live and support myself. My growing fem-

inist consciousness, spurred by the vari-
ous males, liberals, and/or straight midd-
le-class students around me, directed me
to Women's Liberation. There were daycare
centers, a living collective, a gay cell,
music cell, and Ain't I A Woman? - all of
which interested me. I chose daycare be-
cause it was open to me, and I liked kids
because I did think everyone should relate
to them for humanitarian reasons about
their value as the ""future of the Revolu-
tion."" I also knew there was to be a new
women's collective that I wanted to live in.

When I was home babysitting and working
my ass off all the time in my younger days,
however, kids were clearly an economic bur-
den and too often an emotional one, too.

My mom cracked up and almost died twice in
19 years. I always dug the idea of schools
or communities where kids could live and
work and run their own lives. (Actually, in
those days I didn't want to go to school, and
used to imagine that work was easier and
better than school.) I also wanted such

a thing because I really knew where I was
at in the social strata, and I wanted
upper-class kids to fork over the loot and
live like the rest of us. All those times
in school when I was called brassy and be-
lligerent, all that shit I took about how
if I'd behave and lose weight and tow the
line, then those things would come my way...
Fuck it! I made my decision not to get
married or have kids for class reasons

more than anything else, and I consider
that to be a political example of what
makes the working-class foxier than the
middle-class. I resent any woman of eco-
nomic privilege telling me how oppressed
she is as a mother if she is unwilling to
recognize my experience and commitment as
equally valid and substantial. I have
very certain ideas about the nuclear fami-
lies, monogamies, and parental authority,
stemming from my childhood and adult ex-
periences with daycare, and those must be
struggled with too.

The new collective finally formed above
the daycare center I worked in. The co-ops
were getting it together to get University
faculty houses, by one means or another,
and ours (University Parents’ Care Collec-
tive) was first. The center was all white,
and almost totally middle-class and Univer-
sity connected, as students and faculty.

Our collective was supposed to clean the

house every week and work the first and
last hour shifts of every day, (five days

a week) in return for the use of its
second floor and ""kitchen privileges.""

My commitment to the center and its mem-
bers was dependent on that and my politics,
those being that daycare was for freeing
women and children and smashing monogamies
and families (as all those parents will
heartily and piggishly attest to.) All
this time my other politics, including
class, were in constant turmoil.

The group I identify with has few mem-
bers, and this was especially true here
when less than eight feminists worked in
daycare. My involvement with childcare
was a sore spot and a political division
in the AIAW collective and the whole
women's community for a long time. I've
felt the frustration of mothers and know
the meaning of their anger against women
without kids. I've had to deal with it
between myself and those women, and be-
tween myself and oppressed mothers. I've
been reactionary in situations about kids
sort of like parents are, like not trust—
ing the capabilities of non-mothers, just
taking over duties and hassles rather than
explaining things, and not dealing with
their fears or uptightness because they
weren't real to me, and I considered them
all excuses and bigotry. I do know what
it is to be burned on a commitment to child-
care, and I've heard a lot of pigshit from
those who wouldn't deal with their ageism,
privilege and laziness, but there has to
be determined struggle by all of us, and
that includes over the oppression that
non-mothers, especially gay and lower-
class ones, suffer at the hands of this
rich, male society of nuclear families.

Working in the cooperatives here is
oppressive to women, gays, and working-
class people. We've taken endless shit
from packs of middle-class professors,
students, and hippies. Just such a group,
supported by their tied, true or groupie
women, excluded gay feminists from the
first center established here by Women's
Liberation, (Dum Dum Daycare Center). It's
hard enough to struggle over political
issues, let alone try to challenge
parental superiority and ownership when
mothers are paranoid, untrusting and li-
beral to the point of being pawns in men's
hands. We've been threatened with financial"
AintIAWoman,3,2,,9,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page009.txt,"insecurity, no daycare, and the police --  
all of which the reactionaries came through  
on. We had to attend meetings with men  
who were exploitative and condescending.  

We had to listen to the endless hassles of  
married women who oppressed us as lesbians  
and resisted feminist politics like the  
plague. If we could even be gay “publi-  
cally"" it meant practically nothing be-  
yond wearing a button in a foreign lang-  
uage. Co-opted, lost and liberalized.  
There were major freak outs over teaching  
female children to defend themselves and  
not be weak, and trying to make boys be  
less macho, straight and domineering. The  
parents thought we were horrible and fas—  
cistic, and their liberal jive didn't fool  
anyone on our side.  

This summer the parents in the co-op I  
lived in expelled 20 of us—two mothers,  
plus gay and straight volunteers of both  
sexes. Specifically the splits were over  
feminism, separatism, and the gay sociali-  
zing of children. The women of our group  
wanted two days a week of only women in  
the center, and commitment by all the wo-  
men to struggling towards a radical feminist  
analysis dealing with class, race, and  
gayness. We confronted them, hassled,  
were left alone in the center, threatened  
with the police and totally ejected when  
the token Marxist family went on vacation  
and the remaining liberals could get away  
with really exercising their power as they  
saw fit. TOTAL PIC.  

So, the ""radicals"" were shoved out and  
our troubles were only beginning. The  
faction had to form a new center (Sparky  
Daycare Center), and the group was already  
fucked-up. We had defended irresponsible  
volunteers with transitory commitments to  
show solidarity, and had to hassle with  
men — most of whom were bad news, and I  
knew it from my past dealings with them,  
and the way they reacted to separatist  
struggle among the women. They were a  
cause of splits among us.  

The women finally split from the men  
and formed B.O.S.S. (Bitches Out to Stomp  
Sexism) and recommitted themselves, nam-  
ing the Lesbian Daycare Manifesto from  
RAT as the basis of their daycare politics.  
As it happened too many times in the past,  
a number of ""committed radicals"" went  
their merry way, committed to their social  
lives and despicable degeneracy. Distrust  
flourished. During these times I was  
criticized by a member of AIAW for not  
acting collectively by making decisions  
and judgments on my own, or with a few  
members of B.O.S.S. At the time I was  
used to acting on my own because I'd never  
been in any affinity group in daycare out-  
side of occasional solidarity in our liv-  
ing collective, and most of B.O.S.S. and  
Sparky was irresponsible, untrustworthy,  
and had bad politics, if any. But she  

was right, and I tried to struggle over it  
in light of the fact that primary collec-  
tives were to be discussed, etc... The  
B.O.S.S. politics were rhetoric, though,  
and I knew in my gut that I could not con-  
tribute much support to the group. I left  
with a letter to B.O.S.S. of political  
criticisms and disagreement - and a commit-  
ment to Sparky's mothers and children and  
feminist daycare.  

Most of the working-class women left  
B.O.S.S. and the remainder, dominated by  
middle-class guilt and service politics  
outside B.O.S.S. decided to form a free  
childcare center for service to working-  
class and lower-class women. This was a  
total political turnabout, and I had gut  
feelings of revulsion to the idea of those  
women ‘serving women of my class - or even  
thinking they could. It was Classism Su-  
preme, and I only recently realized exact-  
ly how bad that was. Co-opted, liberalized.  
I knew the implications of their classist  
guilt, irresponsibility, and rotten politi-  
cal methods - and I was depressed about the  
fate I expected for working-class women and  
children in their hands. But the children  
I was involved with were dependent on Spar-  
ky and it was the women's community center,  
or so parts of the community thought. If  
I had fully realized the havoc ""service""  
daycare was going to wreak on the women  
staffing it - especially the gay, working-  
class volunteers who have been systematically  
insulted, ignored, de-classed, and generally  
shat on, I would have hid the insurance  
policy, grabbed the kids and split for Des  
Moines. The Lesbian Daycare Manifesto had  
been discarded like a menu.  

AMG Mujer?  

The sore points of anger over women in  
the community not relating to childcare  
came to a head at a general meeting  
slated for confrontation and lots of jus-  
tified, long-simmering resentment. But  
bad methods and confused politics domin-  
ated that anger, and it all started up  
after I and a middle-class woman from  
B.O.S.S. had a fight with another middle-  
class woman who had been irresponsible  
about childcare and refused to come to the  
meeting. I completely lost my temper and  
most of my rage against her at the time  
was based on the fact that she was priv-  
ileged, and had been making $300 a month  
as a work-study student for sauntering  

into the center a few hours a week. If  

I recall she was told to return all the  
money to Sparky and has not to this date.  
Count on middle-class women to allow  
something like that. I regret that  
fight, but I think it did have a heavy  
impact on the previously uncommitted  
women at the meeting, and on the whole  

community.  

Women who previously couldn't be moved  
by anything short of fear of death, were  
organizing and committing themselves.  

The first non-biological mothers group  
(Non BMs) formed out of women at the meet-  
ing who had not done anything for mothers  
or children, and needed a group to organ-  
ize themselves. Non BMs got their shit  
together fast, and has been responsible.  

But the formation of this group sort  

of left me out in the cold. It wasn't for  
me because I had always done childcare  
and didn't need the consciousness-raising  
that non BMs did. And it was closed to  
me, particularly, because everyone was  
pissed about that fight. The other wo-  
man was also excluded when she tried to  
join, because she was a member of B.O.S.S.  
and also, I think, because she was on  
the outs, too. For a while I felt that  
she should have been able to join because  
she hadn't really been any more together  
than Non BMs had, and that she needed the  
organization and discipline. However, this  
was an incorrect idea, because it ignored  
the fact that she was responsible for her  
behavior and lack of direction primarily,  
and it was up to her to take first steps  
to change. And she hasn't so far. The  
point I thought I was trying to make is  
that personal rifts and relationships  
seem to have an unfair influence on the  
membership and political direction of  
groups.  

Anyway, all these months relating to  
Sparky almost totally on my own has been  
a drag. Just like it's a drag to live  
alone or virtually alone and try to do  
childcare outside of daycare all by my-  
self. I now live in a gay, working-class  
collective of three women and four oc-  
casional (definite) kids. Changing my  
living situation has seemed like an ans-  
wer to some of my hassles this year.  

Very recently the volunteers of Sparky  
started to organize in protest against  
Sparky being a service daycare center.  

We all feel a need for the center as a  
place for the children we have, and a  
place where we can freely live as gay  
women, committed to radical changes,  
political education, fighting classism,  
and controlling our interest and labor  
and needs. B.O.S.S. had disintegrated.  

February, 1973  

into the Planning Committee, set up as  

an administrative group to do that kind  

of work. But most of us were too unor-  
ganized and untogether to keep the com-  
mittee and a few other women from con-  
trolling Sparky's money, lease, policies,  
and membership. I want Sparky to serve  
those people who are involved in it--  
that means the community women and the  
working-class mothers and children who  
are members. The mothers started organ-  
izing because some mothers, including  
two Sparky mothers and one non-member  
working-class mother thought the interests  
of working-class women were being trampled  
by the gay non-mothers (half of whom are  
working-class) who opposed the notion of  
service. We did not want to ask community  
children to leave because they were  
""privileged"" according to those mothers,  
because they were either middle-class or  
lived within a middle-class political  
community. This was outrageous - that  

us working-class women were privileged  
because of our radical politics and high  
consciousness. De-classed, co-opted, in-  
sulted. We wanted our children in a  
center that we worked to maintain, and  
that would fulfill our physical, political  
needs. The results of the mothers' meet-  
ings called for such things as male pa-  
rent membership, supported by the sexist  
and homosexist declarations of the mother  
organizers; that women with high feminist  
consciousness could and should deal with  

males and heterosexuals in the other co-  

ops to free up space in the service center.  
When the last general meeting of all Sparky  
workers and mothers was held it was clear  
that the mothers whose rights were supposed-  
ly so threatened by feminism and gayness,  
had not even heard a word of what we were  
concerned with - and showed definite in-  
terest in struggling over the issues. So  
much for the ""low consciousness-potential""  
that lower class people are thought to  
have. And fuck middle-class attitudes  

that say that politics have to be soft-  
pedalled to the masses so they'll fight in  
the Revolution. What bigotry. Patronized,  
manipulated, and co-opted. The working-  
class mothers of Sparky are proof of our  
revolutionary potential.  

Before the last general meeting, all the  
gay working-class volunteers met and came  
up with a statement of criticism and poli-  
tics that included our refusal to work with  
men, and our commitment to struggling  
over how we oppress mothers. We also called  
for struggle from mothers, straight women,  
and middle-class women over what we say is  
our oppression, and the radical analysis we  
support and want to practice. We read it  
at the meeting and the discussion was hope-  
ful, I think, even though there are seri-  
ous splits between some of the mothers and  
a couple of volunteers and the rest of us.  

Some of the things that concern me about  

Sparky are the fact that the almighty  
University-connected women in the center,  
and that one dissenting collective contri-  
butes a large amount of Sparky's income so  
they can threaten our existence anytime.  
They have, in fact, already done so.  

Last month when they proposed complete  
service daycare, and that community child-  
ren must leave, they withheld the money  

in lieu of our protest, and the working-  
class cook's salary went unpaid, not to  
mention the rent, utilities, and food bill.  
They finally paid the money, and a proposal  
was made at the last meeting that, since  
we have to depend on their money, that  
they give the center a month's notice to  
recover it in case of further trouble.  

So now the Planning Committee is experi-  
mentally dissolved, and we are taking a  
month to discuss and explore a new struc-  
ture for Sparky. The mothers are going to  
continue to meet, as will the first non-  
BMs group. The rest of the volunteers  
have several options; to continue individ-  
ually, reform the Planning Committee, or  
form similar non-BMs groups. My living  
collective has joined a non-BMs group:  
with seven other women, five working-  
class, and all gay. Two members of our  
group are 18 or under, and one is over  
thirty. One has been married, one had a  
baby that she didn't keep, and one had an  
illegal abortion. Most of us work, and two  
of us are students. We intend to continue  
our group regardless of the specifics of  
Sparky's new structure. And our commit-  
ment to mothers, children, and our politics."

and the

sparkettes""

Ten of us are now members of a collective called ""Non Biologi-
cal Mothers Group One."" It is basically a support group of women
new to childcare who have come to see childcare as a political
priority. The process that brought us to the place where we knew
we needed the kind of collective we have was a long, often con-
fusing and scary one. We feel it's important to analyze the con-
ditions that brought us here, and explain the reasons our collec-
tive is necessary to us.

When the Iowa City WLF broke into cells in the spring of 1970,
one of those cells was Daycare. It was responsible for establishing
Dum-Dum Daycare Center, the first cooperative, free daycare
center in Iowa City. Since its formation about a half-dozen simil-
ar centers have formed, and many women in the Women's Movement
have volunteered at some time or other at the two centers which
were politically closest to us. For political reasons explained
elsewhere in this issue, a group of gay women split from an exist-
ing center and formed Sparky Daycare in the spring of 1972.

None of the ten of us participated centrally in any of this
history. We were all involved in political projects such as women's
medicine, providing transportation services to local poor people,
AIAW, gay consciousness raising, etc. etc. There have been over a
dozen groups in those two years, some for the whole period, most
shorter-lived. Daycare was looked upon by most non-mothers in the
Women's Movement as another group with political importance, but
no political priority.

The error in this analysis gradually became clearer to many wo-
men in the women's community. We realized that childcare counts
so much it should go without saying; that childcare is essential
to the political life of a community which is not going to exclude
biological mothers, and which envisions a society that includes
all mothers equally. We came to this analysis as a result of angry
mothers finally forcing us to recognize their oppression and act
to change it. Another factor was a growing awareness of our age
chauvinism that was brought about at the insistence of women in
the community eighteen years old and under. And finally, having a
daycare center available that was controlled by women, all of whom
were gay, gave us a forum that allowed us to see how providing
childcare was identified with meeting our own needs.

In this case a beginning analysis was far easier than handling
the uproar all of our minds were in as we saw the direction that
had to be taken. That uproar reached crisis proportions at a Sparky
General Meeting that was called by the small collective of women
who had been running and staffing the developing daycare center in
temporary facilities. Many women attended the meeting who had only
just committed themselves to the politics and action of doing
childcare. We were confused about our responsibilities, afraid of
the confrontation of mothers and full of guilt because of the va-
lidity of their anger towards us. Overall was a feeling of power-
lessness; we were at a loss for direction. The group was diverse,
unorganized except that we all wanted to relate to Sparky and
childcare.

All of these feelings had a material effect on the group. An un-
organized group has no way to deal effectively with the individual
fears and confusions among its members. Even though the general
purpose might be accomplished -- in this case, daycare staffing --
political progress by individual members is made almost impossible.
With no ways to deal with the problems of people, energies are dis-
sipated that might otherwise be channeled into growth and change.

Fortunately this kind of possible stagnation was avoided when
a woman suggested that small groups of childless women be formed
to deal with the fears and hassles many people had felt and ex-
pressed at that meeting. And we were scared! We felt awkward
around kids, and defensive when people who had a lot of experience
took over situations easily. We didn't know the ""right"" way to
handle things. We didn’t know how to play, how to talk to kids,
how to get them to do things. A thousand ""what ifs"" were in our
minds, pigshit and bullshit. And we felt powerless in the adult
group.

At the first meeting of our non-biological mothers group we dis-
cussed much of this, and drew up a statement of purpose as a first
attempt to communicate to the general membership of Sparky. This
is our statement (written mid-summer 1972):

Purposes:

1. To raise our consciousness about the oppression of biological
mothers and to struggle with one another (in this group) to change
our part in that; to not expect biological mothers to have to
raise our consciousness of how we oppress them.

2. To decide what our fears and hassles with doing childcare are,
and to work out solutions to those with other non-biological
mothers.

3. To commit each of ourselves to an established and regular amount
of time in childcare each week, that care to be divided between
work in a daycare center and in our homes. To discipline and sup-
port one another in meeting that commitment, and to increasing it
over time.

volume

4. To interact with children, not passively as babysitters but pos-
itively as people who have responsibility to children; to break
down the socialized and pigshit things in our heads and the heads
of others that work against that.

5. To build positive relationships with children.

Methods: (Methods under #1 relate to Purpose #1, etc.)
1. Meeting regularly for discussion about childcare, consciousness-
raising on the oppression of biological mothers and children.

2. Taking children in our homes for gradually increasing periods of
time. Making our homes baby-proof, safe and enjoyable for children
to be in. (Examples: poisons locked or out of reach; treasured
breakables removed; have things to play with; have some “good foods;
sleeping places with privacy -- and safety -- for children.)

When taking children in our homes, we will try not to have to
work alone; one other of us will help out. This should prevent
freakouts (for both adults and children) and backsliding on our re-
sponsibilities. It should help us learn what to do faster and make
fewer mistakes. It will also solve some problems of one person
with more than one child having to be in two places at once.

3. A proportion of the time we commit to childcare will be time
put in at Sparky Daycare Center. As a group we will guarantee Spar-
ky 60 hours a week regularly, and members of this group commit our-
selves to covering for each other, if any of us can't make her full
daycare time commitment in a given week. There are ten of us in
the group. At present three of us work full time during the hours
that Sparky is open.

So that those of us who work during Sparky's hours do not have
to put all their childcare time into non-collective, at-home child-
care, we are considering setting up nightcare at someone's house
one or more nights a week; would announce it in advance. May also
try to see that childcare gets done during events that women in
general would like to attend (parties, actions, etc.).

4. Once we have started and established as a regular practice our
childcare time commitment (both at home and at the daycare center)
we shall struggle among ourselves, with others, and -- if necess-
ary -- with biological mothers over issues which come out in the
process of re-educating ourselves to making childcare a community
responsibility. (Example: dealing with the nuclear family social-
ization that says that biological mothers are the only and ultimate
authorities about how their biological children should be treated.)

5. Given that children are people, friendships should develop if:
we discipline ourselves to spend enough time with different child-
ren and if we overcome our own fears and uptightness, so that we
can enjoy the people we are with.

AintIAWoman,3,2,,11,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page011.txt,"Looking back, from this point in the collective's life, we can  
see both benefits that we didn't anticipate when we formed and,  
also, some weaknesses in the ways we've been operating.  

Among the benefits, the first is that we've all found it much  
easier than we expected for us to begin making childcare a natural  
and basic part of our lives. Most of us are inviting children to  
be with us in our homes on a frequent, if irregular, basis in addi-  
tion to the scheduled institutional and non-institutional child-  
care we're doing.  

Second, we've found it to be true -- what AntiMass (see AIAW,  
Vol. 2, No. 9) writers say both about how politically critical it  
is for us to become Subjects instead of Objects (actors instead  
of those acted upon), and about the best work being that which you  
create out of your own needs. It was out of our needs that we ini-  
tiated Saturday afternoon, night and overnight care at the center.  
(The evening care provided by the group of gay and straight men,  
Monday - Friday, at our center made our plans for those of us who  
are employed 8-5 unnecessary.) The individual childcare we were do-  
ing on weekends made clear to us our own and others' needs for more  
regular care that would accommodate more children on Saturday af-  
ternoons and nights.  

Third, organizing ourselves has meant that we have a group  
voice/work in the daycare center's policymaking and operating.  
However, we would like to encourage other biologically childless  
volunteers who are not in a childcare-related collective to organ-  
ize themselves too, for their own good and the good of the daycare  
center. Our voices could easily get too loud or heavy among volun-  
teers in the daycare center if we're the only ones organized. (Bio-  
logical mothers are organized, and since this article was written  
another non-mothers group has formed.)  

Through this group also we've been collectively dealing with  
our financial responsibilities to childcare. The daycare center we  
all relate to needs money to run. When it began to get a lot of  
volunteers (about the time most of us got involved in it) the  
group organizing the center demanded pledges from all volunteers  
(not mothers) to be paid monthly on a regular basis. At first they  
were going to do it by taxing people on the basis of a voluntarily-  
prepared financial statement. People objected to what they called  
being ""taxed"" without having a say in how the ""taxing"" was done,  
so the group that was organizing/administering the daycare center  
decided to just ask people to pledge money out of their own sense  
of what they could afford. Both because accountability -- for how  
the books were being kept -- was unclear and sketchy and because  
some women in our collective were unable to contribute any money,  
we decided as a collective to contribute a set amount (from money  
we could hustle out of other people and from ourselves). It turned  
out later that we were able to get more than that amount together  
(when people weren't laid off from work) but it didn't seem nec-  
essary or desirable for us to put all of that into Sparky since,  
according to the budget set up and other incoming monies, they  
didn't need more than that on a regular basis. And, since our  
collective was organized to do childcare a lot of times and places  
besides the daycare center, we felt that money was needed for  
those other responsibilities (like getting equipment, toys, etc.).  

As with the time commitment thing, we've found that dealing  
with the money responsibility both to the daycare center and to  
each other (there are both working class and middle class women  
in our collective, women who live collectively and alone, women  
with debts and without, women employed and not) in a collective  
way has been better than leaving each woman to hassle with it in-  
dividually. It helps both in terms of confrontations (with people  
outside the group) and in terms of our helping deal with the class  
and time differentials amongst us within the collective.  

a woman ?  

February, 1973  

Another daycare need we found was pressing was transportation.  
Currently we pick up and take home three children regularly, ro-  
tating among those of us who have, or can hustle up, the time and  
a car.  

Finally, as a collective we've been doing physical maintain-  

ance -- cleaning, repair, and some of the building work -- for the  
daycare center. Childcare for us has meant not only spending time  
with the children, but also taking on other tasks -- including  

learning new skills related to their safety, health and develop-  
ment. Many of us had for some time wanted, for example, to do  
household repairs, electrical and carpentry work, but until the  
needs of the daycare center and other childcare commitments de-  
manded those skills we did not apply ourselves to them.  

There are at least two large criticisms that we have of our-  
selves and our work thus far. We have not yet (we've been a col-  
lective for four months) struggled enough with other biologically  
childless women and men to get them to begin to meet their child-  
care responsibilities. We see that everyone has childcare respon-  
sibilities and, in a society with an evolved political conscious-  
ness, childcare would be shared by everyone and so no burden for  
anyone.  

Also it has been difficult for us to make sure that the three  
women (of the ten of us) who live alone do not have to do child-  
care work alone (see #2 under Methods, above). The former are hes-  
itant to ask the women who live collectively for help out of fear  
that the latter will wind up having to do double their share. We  
need to do more to prevent this. Maybe going outside our group for  
childcare-sharing work is the answer. Clearly, being able to do  
childcare with the help of another adult is a luxury most biolo-  
gical mothers can't afford, so it may seem contradictory that we  
should try to meet that goal. But since we're trying to create a  
new way of raising/caring for children, we should try to live that  
new way as much as possible.  

X Doris and the Sparkettes is the new name for the  
collective & non-mothers dealing with childcare. We  
changed the name when we realized through criticism,  
that the name was offensive to mothers because it  
sounded like we thought of ourselves as mothers.

AintIAWoman,3,2,,12,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page012.txt,"about daycare licensing,

What's the set-up for federal and state funding of daycare centers?

The Office of Economic Opportunity and the Bureau of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare both have funds which can be used for daycare
but there's endless amounts of requirements that have to be met for
centers to qualify. Both of these federal agencies work together
as far as daycare is concerned. They both allot so much money to
each state annually for daycare but the state can't use that money
unless it can come up with ""matching funds"".

What are ""matching funds""?

The federal government won't directly pick up the total bill for any-
thing, so it filters its money through the state. If the state
wants to use it, it has to come up with a percentage of the cost - then the
federal money - as 3/4 of the amount can be gotten. By the end of
the fiscal year (in June) a lot of states' money isn't used up be-
cause they haven't matched it. This money is turned into the fed-
eral government and then given over to different regions around the
country. (Iowa City's region includes Iowa, Kansas, Illinois,

and other midwestern states) The money that's turned back into
the federal government can be used by a state if it can prove worthy
cause. And this money does not have to be matched.

What about Iowa's money?

In 1971 we heard from the head daycare guy here in Iowa that the Each of the 3 centers got a letter from the district supervisor

state board on daycare (they decide what kind of money they're (the state is divided up into so many districts and the ""daycare
going to get and what they'll use it for) was going to try and get consultant"" inspects all the daycare centers in their (5 county

issue the injunctions. As of today the Standards are still not
ready so we've been getting temporary licenses. (All the two-year
olds from the time of the letters are over two now:)

The age restriction isn't the only requirement keeping us from
having permanent licenses. All sorts of expensive things have to
be done to the buildings. You have the year of your temporary
license to get the things done or they can issue an injunction
against you -- but we've just been applying for temporary ones

and not getting any flack -- yet.

The standards for a permanent license are outrageous. None of them
apply to personal or emotional needs of the kids. It's all about
building improvements, fire escapes, sprinkler systems, toilets,
etc... three toilets for every kid or some nonsense like that --
plus other things that cost a lot of money that daycare centers
fronted or run by big business can afford (and profit off of) and
that places trying to provide free childcare don't have the money
for.

Did you ever get any more money after that big $5,000 ""gift""?

The $5,000 grant that Dum-Dum got was just a one-shot thing and
the next year when we tried to get some money it was too hard, too
much red tape and nonsense and no one pursued it.

What about donations to the centers?

How did you acquire space for the centers? The 75% matching arrangement also applies within the state. Any

money donated to the center can be matched by the state with 75%

that if it's economically possible it's best to try and do without
the license but if you need or want federal funds you have to be

licensed -- and that includes getting the hot lunch program, which
is about the best deal, even though it’s incredible red tape. You
have to record each grocery item you buy, and how it's used. But"
AintIAWoman,3,2,,13,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page013.txt,"funding & regulations

they will reimburse you for all of it - up to 3 meals and 3 snacks a day if you're open, say, 18 to 24 hours. So, you need at least a temporary license.

Are there any additional licensing requirements?

Yeah - another thing you have to do to get a license is have everybody who works at the center fill out a health form verifying a physical examination. The children have to have them, too. They really just want the forms sent in.

Also fire regulations - the fire marshal has to come out and inspect the building. The board of health has to inspect it too.

So after you shell out all the bucks and get an approval you send them into the daycare branch of the State Social Services. Meanwhile the regional daycare consultant is coming around to your center every now and then to look it over and report back to the state about whether or not you should be licensed. The consultant here, Pat Huxol, was the one who ""recommended"" that the centers were not ""operating legally"" because of the two-year olds. I think it was partly her responsibility that that hassle came down in the first place -- but in a lot of ways she tried to help us. She pointed out different places and ways to get things and money that we needed. She told us about Operation Mainstream and the Neighborhood Youth Corps. Those are different federal gov't projects providing jobs for low-income people of different ages. People eligible for the different projects can be employed in different community things, like daycare, and get their salary paid by the gov't. So, if you need the help, you can get staff people for the center. We've had people get those kinds of jobs doing the hot lunch program work. I think those things should be ripped off as much as possible. Those jobs should be falsified and the people should be getting the money -- regardless of what kind of work (if any) that they're actually doing.

Where do requirements for licensing come from?

The federal gov't sets up a 17 page booklet of requirements for daycare centers and the state expounds on it and makes it a little tighter. The federal ones are pretty vague and are used as an outline by the state. One of the newest ones is ""parental involvement,"" and they require that the parents be involved in the daycare center -- this is the hip thing of the year. There are all kinds of spacial requirements, etc. too. Like the federal standard will say ""adequate indoor and outdoor space for children appropriate to their ages - with separate rooms or areas for cooking, toilets and other purposes ... floors and walls that can be fully cleaned, etc."" And the state takes them and makes real picky specifications in about square feet per child, etc. So, if you meet state standards you meet federal ones.

Who administers hot lunch programs?

Hot lunch projects come under the State Department of Public Instruction. Information can be gotten from them. Over that is the Federal Dept. of Agriculture -- and that's where the money comes from. It's matched 75% from Agriculture and 25% from the State Dept. Hot lunch doesn't have to be administered for every particular child. The center has to meet licensing standards, etc. They want to know the economic background of all the people in the center. We can be pretty up front about it since we're trying to serve low income people -- but some of the centers have university people like students and professors and they still get hot lunch money.

How do you get matching funds for donations?

This is for within the state. Say if the Student Senate from the University gives us money they have to set up an ongoing contract with the county board of supervisors and it's just a lot of red tape. Another way to get money is if any ADC parents are in the center and are employed or go to school, especially women on the WIN Program, they can get $75 a month to pay for childcare -- but it's a lot more hassle and shit work for the women on ADC.

What is the WIN Program?

Work Incentive Program for women on welfare to go to school and get a job to get off welfare. I think it's best for women on welfare to just get that daycare money for themselves.

Anything else on licensing?

Yes -- you have to get incorporated. It's a legal thing that any lawyer can tell you how to do and it costs about $20. It just involves a bunch of bullshit -- you have to write out by-laws and articles of incorporation.

Some of the new proposals for standards require at least 6 staff members -- ""the nursery's childcare staff and teachers shall have a knowledge of child development and behavior and have the ability to give the children a feeling of security and comfort under the supervision of the executive or operator, be responsible for the guidance and direct childcare."" We just got forms at the new daycare center for the workers to fill out. They're part medical and part of them are for the volunteer's work experience with children (and just work experience.) I think that's how they're trying to decide if people are ""qualified"" and have that ""knowledge"" of child development. Each center is supposed to keep all kinds of forms on all the kids and workers there on file at all times. ""Personal Records for the nursery staff will be complete, including medical reports.. No administrative professional or childcare staff member shall be under the age of 16 or over the age of 70."" I imagine that the licensing standards vary from state to state.

What we've been trying to do is meet the requirements that we can without too much hassle, and shying on the ones that are too much hassle or cost too much to meet. So far we've kept temporary licenses by doing that. I don't know how long that'll last.

children’s liberation

I think children get fucked over a whole lot and they need help. They need to figure out for themselves what to do and sometimes they don't know what to do. I have my feelings hurt a lot. I think it's fair but think about other people except yourself and people should think kids do have feelings also. I think that maybe some people think that this letter or what do you want to call it is different but I'm just telling people what I think is going on.

Like adults have people to talk to. Children have to ask. People probably think this isn't the heaviest thing that I've ever wrote but somebody had to tell people what it is about and it's hard keeping it inside. I think it had to come out and people probably think that kids don't like thinking that adults have more power and they can make you leave the room and do other stuff that children don't like to do and that's what I think about stuff going on."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,14,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page014.txt,"The concept of service has always bothered me  
but maybe I should explain what I mean by ser-  
vice. I mean by service those projects that we  
do for a group of people other than ourselves--  
a group we do not identify with. For instance,  
the class action workshop was a group of women  
who offered transportation to welfare mothers  
to pick up their government surplus food and  
also sent out welfare handbooks to people on  
welfare in this county. None of these women  
were on welfare themselves. Also the Free  
Medical Clinic in Iowa City, and most of the  
daycare centers including Sparky where you and  
I work.  

There are two things I really believe in--  
one is that people needing a service should  
have control over the service they receive, the  
other that people should have control over  
their own labor. Since the workers and users  
of a service are rarely the same people, it  
seems to me that someone ends up being screw-  
ed. Usually I think it is the people most in  
need of the service that suffer at the hands  
of those offering the service who normally  
have no gut understanding of the need. But  
there are so many complexities to the issue of  
daycare and in the past I think volunteers  
and workers at daycare centers have been  
forced to hide or give up their feminist poli-  
tics in order to supply service to people who  
did not accept them, to work in situations  
that were offensive to them; to find it imposs-  
ible to relate to children in any honest way.  

What you say about service is substantiated  
by my experiences. As you know, I was in the  
class action workshop and have had a lot of  
time to observe the Free Medical Clinic be-  
cause I work there.  

My reason for involving myself in class  
action workshop was that I wanted to work on  
something that had tangible results. The only  
real tangible result of that was that I felt  
that I was doing something. Is that clear?  
What I'm trying to say is that service pro-  
jects often make the do-gooder feel good. Not  
a very good reason for existence.  

The Free Medical Clinic speaks for itself.  
It serves no one but the doctors who assuage  
their guilt on the patients. The Women's  
Clinic was different, I felt, because the wo-  
men involved had a stake in the clinic because  
we needed it and had some control of it. And  
when we found that we would lose that control  
by altering its structure (by using male doc-  
tors because the female doctors would not sup-  
port us) we closed it down because it was no  
longer useful to us. That seems correct to  
me.  

Which brings me to Sparky. I don't even  
think of it in terms of being a service pro-  
ject, for two reasons. First, it meets the  

what I want to say to you in response to  
your saying that you don't see Sparky as a ser-  
vice daycare center is that some people in the  
center do and that issue is not by any means  
settled. I think it is an issue that women  
without children should be very clear in their  
heads about ‘cause we will have to fight for  
control and I think we should be sure that we  
have valid reasons for doing so. So let me try  
to explain what my reasons are ‘cause they re-  
late directly to my negative feelings about  
service projects.  

If the mothers had final control in the cen-  
ter and those of us without children worked  
there to serve mothers and to serve children  
we would be forced by the situation to see our  
function as charity. That is really all char-  
ity is--a payoff to oppressed people from the  
guilty. I do understand how in a sense that  
should seem right--a way of equalizing oppres-  
sions. But in reality, I don't think the in-  
equalities are that clear because as women we  
all carry various scars and many oppressions  
and any equalizing that is to be done should  
not be as superficial as putting in time due.  
I want and I think we can change in a more  
complete way. For instance, the term non-bio-  
logical mother has been tossed around a lot  
since the non-biological mothers group was  
formed. When we first chose that name, I  
think we only did so to identify ourselves as  
women without children. Now it has become used  
as (or at least interpreted as) us calling  
ourselves mothers. I can see how offensive  
that could be to biological mothers--that af-  
ter doing childcare for a few months, we  
think we should be referred to as mothers.  

However, I think what we should be going toward  
is in fact being mothers, toward viewing child-  
care as a women's issue--crucial to all women,  
political work that all women must work in and  
have a stake in--not something we do for those  
other women or those other women's children,  
but something we all do for ourselves. The only  
way I can see this happening is a fairly high  
level of struggle between women, all the women  
involved and to totally reject the sentiment  
that we are responsible for the oppression of  
mothers. Women without children have not suf-  
fered that oppression 'though some have suffer-  
ed other oppressions and so I can understand  
how we can rightfully be resented but we have  
not caused it. We have perhaps perpetuated it  
just as many mothers have perpetuated the op-  
pression of gay women. I think I want to walk

and playthings that cost a lot of money.  

One way around that is to build as much  
stuff as you can yourself.  

Wood is expensive, but lumber yards will  
always let you raid their scrap pile. They  
might even give you some wood if you say  
it's for a daycare center, but we haven't  
had luck with this. For heavier lumber  
like 4x4's and 2x4's go to a construction  
site and ask if they have any old or short  
pieces. Heavy construction sites like  
high rises or poured concrete buildings  
even though there's not a stick in them  
still use lumber for forms, scaffolding and  
supports. A poured concrete building in  
the process of being built will have a  
whole shit load of 4x4's to get rid of.  

Lumber is named for what it measures before  
it is finished and dried.  

The measurements of our lumber was 3/4""  
by 11 1/4"". First, cut the 5 pieces you  
need:  

top--12 1/4""x11 1/4""  
2 sides--11 1/4""x11 1/4""  
2 sides--10 3/4""x11 1/4""  

Then nail the top and the two square sides  
together. When you nail to a board on end  
like this make sure there is a sturdy surf-  
ace beneath the upright piece or else some  
of your effort is wasted. Use something  

of similar height to prop up the other end  
of the horizontal piece. Don't fight it.  

Next weekend we are going to begin build-  
ing the SUPER PLAYTHING. We designed it by  
gathering ideas from Big Rock Candy Moun-  
tain (published 6 times/yr by Portola  
Institute Inc., 1115 Merrill St., Menlo  
Park, Calif. 94025) and by trying to in-  
clude in it as many motor developing things  
as possible. We hope it will help the kids  
mature physically, become stronger and give  
them something to organize their playing  
around so we won't always have to be stop-  
ping fights and destruction.  

We were lucky obtaining material. We got  
the 4x4's from a heavy construction site,  
the 2x4's we found in a garage, and the  
1x2's and plywood we scavenged from houses  
the city is tearing down because of urban  
renewal. When working with lumber this  
thick that must have square ends, you  
should probably borrow a power saw. It's  
not that the wood is that hard to saw by  
hand, but your body naturally slants the saw  
one way or the other. When sawing through  
3 1/2"" of wood you may get a difference of  
1/2"" between one side and the other.  

SUPER PLAYTHING  

won't be built in a day,  

blade on your screwdriver is worn or has  
been sharpened or used as a chisel so it  
keeps slipping out of the slot (the part  
fitting into the screw should have a flat  
edge for gripping);  

or the wood you are screwing into is hard  
wood or has a knot and you should have  
drilled a hole in the first place and prob-  
ably put beeswax on the screw.  

I have drawn a conclusion from my exper-  
ience about women tackling problems or  

needs of our community by providing child-  
care for our children. Second, it meets  
my need to be with children and relate to them  
in a setting that is more realistic in terms  
of my life as a gay woman. Working at Trinity  
was a sham. (Trinity is a daycare center for  
poor women who need free childcare. It's  
come by middle-class women who see it as a  
charitable babysitting service. There's little  
parent/volunteer communication at Trinity.)  
I don't feel that Sparky is like that.  
I need Sparky. It gives me support in dealing  
with children and my childcare responsibilities.  
Those two things are separate in my mind. I  
want to relate to children. Because I'm gay  
and childless, I'm isolated from them in this  
society and Sparky helps to break down that  
isolation. And because I see childcare as a  
political responsibility, Sparky helps me to  
begin to meet that responsibility.  

Your feeling about Sparky is the same as  

I agree that the service issue is still  
hanging. And in part I blame the cumbersome  
structure. Our last general meeting with the  
mothers (over a month ago) was pretty positive,  
I thought. But we've got to meet together more  

If you want the joint to be stronger use  
white glue along with the nails. You can  
also use screws, but if you do, make it  
easier for yourself and drill a hole for the  
screw with a bit slightly smaller than the  
diameter of the shank of the screw.  

the trade (either by reading, experience or  
asking someone) and you will know more  
about leverage and what tools you need.  

One more thing: the more jobs you do  
building, repairing or working on your car,  
the easier all craft and mechanical work  
will be to you because you will be learn-  
ing how to reason mechanically and spa-  

mine now. I need it too and I get scared when  
I think about the hassles and disagreements  
that go on there, particularly the issue of  
control: should the mothers have final control  
or should everyone involved have something to  
say. I get scared because I don't want to  
lose what I have gained regarding childcare.  

I don't want to slip back to that thinking of  
two years ago when I felt it was right that I  

to be on either end of a power struggle. I  
want that for everyone involved in Sparky.  
I think it’s of highest importance that  
we all continue to speak from our needs and to  
listen to the needs of everyone. I don't want  
having any control in the center to threaten  
me and could possibly take away or curtail my  
access to the center as a means of relating to  
children and the whole work involved in child-  
care.  

There's nothing more frustrating than  
spending 15 min to get a screw in--one  
quarter turn at a time. Whenever you are  
building and a task is that hard, just stop  
and think. You are either doing something  
wrong or you don't have the right tool for  
the job. For instance if it is taking you 15  
min to put in a screw, your screwdriver may  
have the wrong size blade for the slot in the  
screw; you may be trying to get by without a  
Phillips head screwdriver for a Phillips head screw; the  

Once you have the 2 square sides and top  
nailed together, nail the other two sides  
in. For ease in handling turn what you  
have built on its side like the letter ""c"",  
then when you put the other side in you can  
hold it in place by pressing down on the  
side. Remember the side you are putting in goes  
from the inside of one square side to the  
outside of the other square side. Remember the side you are  
putting in goes from the inside of one  
square side to the outside of the other  
square side.  

Now do the same with the last piece of wood  
which should also measure 10 3/4""x11 1/4"" and you're done.

AintIAWoman,3,2,,15,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page015.txt,"The dialogue (among three women) which follows took place over a period  
of time -- shortly after a not-quite-confrontation at a general meeting  

of the daycare center workers and some mothers (who were not present, I'm a 30 year old middle-class gay woman with  

but whose letters to the meeting were read) and some of the gay women regular time and financial commitments to  

who do childcare there. a daycare center. My childcare responsi-  

The three of us who took part in this dialogue decided to have it bilities are still far from ""a way of life.""  
  
I am a 30 year old working-class dyke responsible, with  
several other women, for the care of a child. I have  
regular daycare hours and regular financial daycare  

responsibilities. I also have regular non-institutional  
childcare responsibilities.  

I am newly gay, newly dealing with my working-class origins,  

thirty years old.  

I have regular time and money committ-  

ments both to a daycare center and to a child whom I am  
helping to raise collectively.  

As a gay, single woman it took me a while to understand how I think  
the anger mothers focus against me makes me angry. There is no doubt  
in my mind that mothers are oppressed. But certainly not because I'm  

a single, gay woman. Their oppression started long before I came on whoever has the privilege shares in the oppression  

the scene. Like most women, mothers have been oppressed by men in the  
heterosexual world. And whether having children was not a choice for  
mothers, it still was not something urged on them by a single, gay  
world.  

But that's not really hearing the mother who is speaking.  

It's not that  

you're privileged being a single woman, it's that you're privileged  
not to do 24-hour daycare. And having control over some of your 24  
hours has more importance than having social approval which you can do  

nothing with.  
This is a privilege hard won by lesbians who came up when there  

Social approval really means the ease with which you  
handle your economic life and the safety with which  

you live your public and private life.  

""Control"" every day from a heterosexual world that is already  
always there. The mother doesn't have to fight for that ""control""  
during the time, however piddly, that she can get away from the  
burdens of childcare. I don't know any lesbians about my age  

who are ""old gay"" and who aren't also working-class. Maybe hasty,  
maybe worth considering.  

Something about ""priority"" of oppressions and digging up the past...  
Still should listen to the experience of women who've been dealing  
with the oppression longer (old gay vs. new gay).  

But on class oppression that's equally long or longer than  
gayness (for individual women): ""length"" would screw mothers  
as a criterion, since most haven't had children as long as  
most old gay women have been gay. Do you mean ""within an  
oppression""?  

Obvious ty can't let length screw mothers and one day's oppression is  
too much, but my suspicion of heterosexual women, oppressed four or  

five years with kids, setting policy is justified.  

But the privilege is seen only within the context of women struggling to build an  
equal community of women, because outside that community that time privilege of  
single women is piddling compared to the privilege of men. And that's what keeps  

getting ignored. That's where the struggle should be but where mothers, by the nature  

of the greater oppressive power of men, understandably could never begin to make a  

dent the way they have in the women's community of Iowa City. In the ideal socialist  
world everyone does daycare. But the fact that men almost never do daycare is oppressive  
to mothers. And secondly oppressive to the single women and the single, gay women who  

are (though only recently) shouldering responsibilities to women with children.  

The double oppression, however, is when women with children ask single, gay women--  
oppressed in a much different way by men--to work in centers with men in order that  
their sons won't become too ""wimpy"" (or their daughters too strong???) The mother  
who tries to move me to the rear of my oppression with her oppression is fighting a  
losing battle. I absolutely refuse to do daycare in heterosexual, sexist and homo-  
sexist daycare centers in order to right imbalances. I will try to deal with it on  
my own territory but I'll be damned if I'm stepping back into male territory to do  
it. You cannot trade one oppression for another and believe anything's gained.  
When the angry voices have died down, that's still what I have to say.  

At present in Sparky Day Care Center ""trade"" is inappropriate since  
lesbians are ""trading"" childcare and it is not clear that mothers  
are willing to ""trade"" any struggle on homosexism.  

It is possible that lesbians may have to do out-of-  
institution childcare in order to preserve or create  
a territory.  

""Helping balance"" that (mother's) oppression is so impermanent (apropos  
remarks about biological mothers being stuck with the childcare after every-  
body else gets tired/freaks out/goes away). Part of our consciousness-  

raising about childcare should include that it should be a way of life  
for everyone, not just a do-it-in-your-spare-time thing. This applies to  
our recruiting other people to do childcare, too.  

This is true but lesbians are used to dealing with  

the ""helping balance"" of heterosexual women. They  

already control--determine-- issues for the movement.  

True they have not been working-class straight women,  
but over homosexism the shit smells the same.

AintIAWoman,3,2,,16,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page016.txt,"Somehow analyze the structure of dissension....

One lesson well learned through childcare hassles is that the only produc-
tive confrontation is in groups and in person. (That's not to say learning
doesn't go on in other ways than by confrontation.) Confrontations have
to do with politics and politics are never simple. Talking one-to-one
after a confrontation tends to so simplify the politics because no one
person can represent the variety of struggles in a group. So no headway
is made, issues are muddied, and everyone hears 2nd or 5th hand what's
been said--open range for gossip and backbiting.

among ourselves

One-to-one talking, like working out your politics alone and outside of
any collective has the disadvantages of (1) not representing the variety
of struggles in a group; (2) of not allowing the people involved to hear
the different ways a certain event in time has been perceived (factual
clarity). Collective or public talking's disadvantage of possibly not
exposing all those varieties of political struggle and fact perception
--because of the time limits, shyness or intimidation individuals may feel--
can be rectified by careful attention to the matter of hearing everyone.
Whereas, when only 2 people speak to each other -- no amount of trying to
consider other points of view, life situations, can adequately represent them
if those who experience them are absent. The need for collective and public
group struggle is clear, but we must do it in a context which does not
exclude women with less time (because of work and/or children) from partici-
pating--one of the main failings of the women's community in Iowa City.

One of the big problems is having to speak with a loud, urgent voice in
order to be heard. We've all learned that in order to get people to under-
stand and/or deal with our oppressions, we have to first convince them we
have a voice at all. So when you have to be loud and dramatic and overcome
your being used to never having a voice, not everything comes out the way
you'd want it to. Not to mention the anger. I don't see any way around
that. And people who get blown over a little by such voices should be
aware of why and give space to the women speaking. (Unless, of course,
their own space is being totally confiscated by the women speaking.

(continued)

Unless these women say things that are so blatantly racist, classist,
sexist or homosexist that it threatens whatever space other women have
for themselves.) If we only hear the ""incorrect"" thinking the oppressed
are doing, we never hear their oppression.

Postscript: Dissension with a genuine attitude of struggle (oppressed people strug-
gling together to unite without oppressing each other) is not destructive.

What is destructive is anything which prevents or inhibits that struggle,
including assuming that the other is either unwilling or unable either
to listen or to change and taking part of the facts or issue for the
whole (by listening to gossip instead of verifying the facts, by isolating
oneself from others while making judgments and/or taking actions which
affect them).

On this issue in this community-- up until very recently--these wrong
practices have been the rule rather than the exception. That is beginning
to change now and already the benefits are beginning to show. In the most
recent daycare meeting there was some indication on many sides for willing-
ness to struggle.

a lesbian mother

Here are a few viewpoints on childcare, based on my experience
as the lesbian mother of a four year old girl.

1. Female children need care from dykes, starting from an early
age. Development of a child's sexuality and body image starts at
infancy, and is much influenced by her physical contact with
adults. In the nuclear family, a woman has the status of an object,
not an autonomous being and her body communicates this concept of
femaleness to her daughter. The child is taught to be passive,
feminine, and heterosexual before she reaches school.

A dyke is a better mother than a straight woman in that respect,
because a dyke's concept of herself and other women offers the
child much more space for the growth and development of aggressiveness,
initiative, self-confidence and other dykey qualities.

2. Male supremacy is very uptight about lesbians raising girls;
we threaten them. The courts view a lesbian mother as an unwholesome
influence on a child, similar to an alcoholic or a prostitute. So a lesbian
stands a small chance of keeping custody of her child if her ex-husband,
family, or any male institution takes the slightest interest in removing
the child. The threat can be used to force a lesbian to raise her daughter
“normally” -- that is, to meet male approval. Some women have been driven
to desperate lengths to keep their children, such as changing their names
and moving out of state.

3. A female child needs good quality care from several women to
develop a strong sense of self-worth and independence from her
mother. It's real weird for a child to feel that one person cares
intensely for her and no one else gives a shit. She wonders what
would happen to her if her mother disappeared, and why no one else
bothers with her much. A child who regularly gets positive feedback
from several directions is much less easily defeated by a blast of negative
energy than is a child who is totally dependent on her mother.

A WOMAN?

speaks

4. Mother's commitment to her child.

There is, I believe, an element of choice in motherhood (although I did not
""choose"" to be oppressed and the choice I made does not justify my oppression),
and that is that any mother can choose at any time to abandon her child. A year ago, I did abandon my daughter to the care of her father. I was working and living alone with her and constantly fatigued; I knew no women who would do childcare for me (her?). So he took custody of her and she got real messed up. After much soul searching, I realized that I had to try to regain custody of her; I felt that no political involvement could be more meaningful or productive than caring for her. But then I hit the lesbian-mother stumbling block; my chances in court were poor, according to several lawyers. So finally I had to disappear with her. The alternative was to abandon her to the mutilation of a ""straight"" upbringing -- Barbie dolls, makeup, skirts, kissing up to ""Daddy.""

In response to the “old gay"" view that children are products of hetero relationships and so no responsibility of gay women:

No other woman would do this for her. I regard my decision to care for my daughter as a lesbian-feminist commitment. She is not a leftover from a heterosexual relationship; she is a four year old woman, as worthy of my time and energy (and anyone's) as any other woman.

5. Males are unfit to care for female children.

6. I will take no responsibility for the care of male children,
and question the motives of women who do take that responsibility.

AintIAWoman,3,2,,17,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page017.txt,"Teri is a three-year-old child who was  
living with her biological mother in a  
collective situation that was intolerable  
for her: while her mother was happy there,  
Teri was not compatible with the other  
people in the collective. She needed an-  
other place to live and someone else to  
live with.  

The time it took to evolve a solution  
for Teri illustrates some things we are  
gradually becoming more conscious of: that  
“children are people who have individual  
personalities, and that all adults do not  
get along with all children (or vice versa)  
any more than they get along with all  
other adults. That children are entirely  
dependent on adults for a long time makes  
it more difficult to deal with personality  
conflicts as such: you can't just stay  
away from a child you are responsible for.  
You could get someone else to take respon-  
sibility for the child, but there are two  
things that make it real hard. The main  
one, of course, is that no one is into  
giving up as much of her self-determination  
as taking care of a child requires. The  
other thing is that the mystique of mother-  
hood still haunts us and no biological  
mother is supposed to not like her child.  
Even as people give voice to the oppression  
of mothers and try to take ""their share""  
of responsibility and hassle for the chil-  
dren we have, they are shocked and not  
understanding of mothers who could want to  
escape this hassle when hassle is all it is.  

Anyway, after much thinking and talking  
and hassle among adults, a group of people  
became ""mother"" to Teri, taking complete  
responsibility for her. We are a group of  
eight women. All of us are gay. Five of  
us are working-class, three are middle-  
class. We all knew each other, previous  
to coming together in this group, through  
the political and social functioning of  
the women's community here. Some of us  
merely knew each other, some are good  
friends, some are lovers. We came together  
at our first meeting not knowing who would  
be there -- that meeting that finally  
happened after Teri's mother came to us  
and declared her desperation -- but we  
found that it was a reasonable number of  
people (in fact an amazingly large number  
considering how much more this is than a  
commitment to daycare) and that we all  
felt we could work together. We have basic  
agreements in theory on things like good  
foods being important for children, teach-  
ing her to be strong and independent,  
teaching her to be a dyke not a lady,  
teaching her that her mind and body are  
integral and that her sexuality is part of  
that whole, etc. We want her to learn  
these things through secure but non-depen-  
dent relationships with many people which  
we think can be formed by the structure  
that we have since set up for her.

Actually, that structure was real simple  
and easy. We had a meeting, and there were  
eight of us, so we could each take respon-  
sibility for one day a week (with a double-  
up), just once a week, and we each put in  
$2 a month into expenses, that's not too  
much... We constructed a bedroom for her in  
the basement of the living collective of  
two in our group and moved her into the  
daycare center where we all work. In order  

for the adults to communicate across this  

structure, we have a logbook that accompa-  
nies Teri and her toothbrush wherever they  
go, and scheduled meetings twice a month to  
talk about things. And it all seems cool  

and easy...  

...except that Teri is a complicated  
and needful person whose needs are much  
more than just those present material ones  

that are so easily filled. We have become  
the people who are totally responsible for  
Teri's mental and emotional well-being as  
well. That is real frightening. It depends  
on us whether she is happy, whether she  
feels loved and how dependent she is. And  
it is even more frightening to have this  
responsibility and to be trying to fulfill  
it by creating a totally new structure.  

We have an analysis of what we are doing:  
it is unnecessary, if not damaging, for a  
child (or any person) to be dependent on  
one person; the structure of mono-relating  
is conducive to the development of jealousy  
and possessiveness, which are destructive.  
Living with eight people who are all equally  
responsible to her, Teri will see many  
points of view and ways of dealing with  
things as valid, rather than just one or  
two. She will be with each adult for  
short enough periods of time that that time  
can be enjoyable and not oppressive for  
either of them in terms of resentment and  
hostility over constant demands, or constant  
dependency, or just constant togetherness.  
And because her ""mothers"" do not all live  
in the same house, and have various affil-  
iations throughout the women's community,  

the situation is in a sense community,  
rather than individual, responsibility  

to her. So, we decided she would live in  
one place four days a week and that would  
be her home, a base of security for her,  
and that other days she would visit at  
other people's houses and relate to a dif-  
ferent person each day and that will be a  
really good way for her to live.  

But how do we know? Our well-thought-  
out analysis is just that: ideas. What we  
are doing has never been tried extensively.  
No one is experienced in raising a child  
until she does it, but the way we are doing  
it has not even poor tradition to back it  
up. And much as we may believe in it, it  
is an experiment whose subject is a little  
girl whose entire life is dependent on us...  
and whom we love very much. That is why  
it is so frightening.  

And we have not worked everything out  
yet even as far as practicalities go.  
Raising a child is a long-term thing and  
people have not stated specifically that  
they plan to stay in Iowa City until she  
grows up. Since it is unlikely that our  
whole group will move, going to something  
else would mean leaving Teri. Money will  
be a bigger problem as she gets older than  
it is now. What will be the legal hassles:  
will one of us have to become her owner,  
i.e., adopt her, in order for all of us to  
take care of her? What will happen if  
there are splits within the group? Because  
it is so intensely difficult to set up such  
a new structure in this society, taking  
responsibility for Teri is made even  
more frightening.  

My perspective on writing this is that  
for several months before our group formed,  
while Teri still lived in her mother's  
collective, I had been taking care of  
Teri two nights a week. Only one other  
woman in the group was relating to her on  
any regular basis at all, although we all  
knew her to differing degrees. Now Teri  
lives in my collective, her room is right  
next to mine, she shares my bathroom and  
we are just generally thrown together a  
lot. Teri knows me better than she knows  
any of the other women, she has felt closer  
to me in some ways and more secure with me,  
and this manifests itself at times in a  
kind of clinging dependency on me that is  
a source of worry and some annoyance with-  
in our group. I have been criticized for  

perhaps not discouraging this dependency  
enough. The consensus of the group now  
seems to be, however, that it is more a  
function of our prior relationship than a  
growing unhealthy relationship now, that  
it is good that she feels close to one of  
us, and that eventually she will feel as  
close to all of us.  

Teri is happier now than she was when  
she lived with her mother's collective --  
she is more sociable and more secure. She  
has been calling our collective ""my house""  
and seems to have relaxed into knowing we  
are going to be there. It seems as if for  
now our ideas are working out in practice.  
And so now we can look ahead...at the  
next 15 years.

This letter concerns what I consider a blatant rip-off of working
and lower class women and children; that is, allowing Teri to
attend Sparky. My understanding is that Sparky exists to provide a service to
women and children who have no other options for childcare--i.e.
working class women. Teri clearly has other options. She is still a member of Dum Dum,
a privileged position to be in. I just cannot see how anyone can
justify her being in Sparky and taking a place so badly needed
by working class people. Every woman who staffs Sparky, the women
taking responsibility for Teri, and even myself are in very pri-
vileged positions. Despite the fact that some of us are from
working class backgrounds we have politics that put us at an ad-
vantage in being able to provide physically for ourselves. Being
able to staff Sparky comes of privilege too--you have time. It
seems very clear to me that the people who support Teri's member-
ship in Sparky are using their privilege to provide for an already
privileged child and group of people who are taking care of her.

I have heard some arguments why Teri should be there--or can
be there. I want to say that I consider some partially valid
but any validity is overridden by the fact that there are so many
working class people who need daycare. One argument is that some
of the people will not see Teri except one day a week if she is
not in Sparky and this is detrimental to developing any kind of
relationship with her, etc. Valid but what about the space she's
taking--that seems much more important to me.

Another is the women in the group taking responsibility for
Teri want to spend the time they do childcare at Sparky, not work-
ing part of the time at Dum Dum to keep Teri there. I can't see
why they would have to spend any less time at Sparky when the

I am writing this because I want you to know what my reaction to
your letter was. I don't think it is wise to meet with you person-
ally as you suggested because I think that will only increase second
and third hand misunderstanding and misinformation. In spite of
disadvantages, responding to you by letter has the advantage of be-
ing public (I will post a copy at Sparky) and of inviting comment
and criticism.

Several people made the following points at last Sunday's
meeting. I am repeating the ones I made, share or would like to
add. The issue about Teri coming to Sparky has already been set-
tled, but the things in your letter that concern her and which you
want to be policy are what I want to talk about.

1. It is offensive to regard all of the people who staff
Sparky as privileged. If politics could change class the Chinese
Revolution would have been won with ideas....

2. What support the community provides for its members is
largely 'moral'. In this society, sharing of material goods comes
out of bounty. Lower and working class women do not become privi-
leged when some of this bounty happens their way. A ""temporary""
privilege, first of all, doesn't change your class and secondly,
it's like a welfare benefit, with all kinds of strings attached.
The money your collective pledges is a good example of a temporary
privilege coming out of bounty with strings attached.

3. I pledged money and time to Sparky not because it was to
serve lower and working class women but because I had been remiss
in childcare responsibilities and I wanted to begin struggling with
that in spite of the chaos of the Sparky-Woman Center meeting. I
never supported the notion of service and found most of what was
said about lower-working class women at that meeting offensive.

4. I got tremendously pissed at your desire to serve lower
and working class women you don't yet know, when you refused to
hear what lower and working class women, who you do know, wanted.
Teri's group is as many lower-working class as middle class women.
It is insane to declare those women privileged because they are
working with middle class women.

5. Sparky will collapse unless the staff has a stake in its
operation. That stake is community children. It is not simply a
question of working at Dum Dum being inconvenient and uncomfortable.
Women who have been struggling with class and service re childcare.

The dialogue concerns itself with whether or not children
of the women’s community should be at Sparky, whether Sparky should be a cen-
ter for the women's community in Iowa City or lower and working class mothers or any
At that meeting it was decided that Teri should be at Sparky and
women's community children should be asked to leave but the issue is not

this point and the dialogue that follows presents the issue and debate going

hours at Dum Dum are not very demanding--especially when there are
seven women involved and a deal could easily be made with Dum Dum.
Working those extra hours is an inconvenience and, given the mem-
bership of Dum Dum, uncomfortable. It is the privilege of the
group not to have to be inconvenienced and uncomfortable--but
what of the ""inconvenience"" a working class woman is subjected to
because she has no childcare?

I've heard other arguments but in my mind I always reduce
those arguments down to the fact that there are other options for
Teri and she is taking the place of another child who has no other
place.

As I've written this I've reconsidered my position on Jane,
Gladys & Betsy's being in Sparky. I had thought of it as a
different situation than Teri's because of the position they were
put in by the change from feminist to a service daycare for work-
ing class women and children. However, there are now several
openings at Dum Dum and no waiting list (I don't know the situation
at other centers) and they could get in right away. They should
have been on the waiting list of some other center long ago. I
know it's true that there are only four working class children at
this point in Sparky and that Teri, Gladys, Jane & Betsy are
not taking places that should go to working class children. I
don't know the recruiting situation at Sparky, but I do know there
are a lot of working class people who need childcare and Sparky
should fill up real fast. I can only see those few children's
presence as holding up someone who needs childcare at Sparky so
I can't see putting it off until the need arises as a good thing
to do. Also, once it's upon you to make a decision I can see the
temptation as too great to let them remain.

I think Sparky should make it its policy not to allow in any
members who have other options for childcare.

I have come to understand how and why the community should meet its
own needs.

6. If I remember correctly, at about the same time as you were
digging your class origins with others, I was too. I had more
trouble (still have) with internalized classism and shuffling over
class than I did with blatant classism. The hardest thing for
me to do was to stop trying to learn about class from middle class
women. They have no stake in the analysis you ""mutually"" come up
with. I am assuming from my own experience that trying to deal
with this issue alone (alone among middle class women) has made
the going rough and slow for you. It is a mistake to regard
""temporary privileges"" as having the same effect on women from
different classes. This was offensive to the lower and working
class women in Teri's group and it is offensive to me as a working
class staff member. My commitment of time and money is at a dif-
ferent cost than middle class women because if Sparky doesn't work,
if the community doesn't work, I've got nothing. You are probably
discovering, for example, that the education you are receiving is
different from the education middle class women are receiving.

You will not be able to do quite the same things with your degree
as a middle class woman can do--and you will be pissed when people
suggest that you can. Again, I am saying this based on my own
experience. You may be able to hustle “supports” from middle class
women all your life, and while it will probably mess up your class
consciousness, it won't change your class. It should be obvious
to you that I am making the points under #6 as much for myself as
for you, but I'm taking the time to write this to you because I
believe that the criticisms in your letter come from a distorted
class consciousness.

Can I count on you to share the contents of this letter with
your collective because I think this response concerns Mary's
criticism too. I would only add for her that Teri forced us to
deal again with an admittance policy that was never firm and al-
ways contained more rhetoric and bullshit than sense.

I welcome a response if you would like to make one, either
by letter or in a group. But as I said at the beginning I will
not meet with you alone both because of the climate surrounding
this question and because the political issues always get watered
down when two people ""discuss"" them.

* Jane, Gladys and Betsy are children of women considered part of
the women's community here.

* The women's ctr.-Sparky meeting was an early meeting of people
interested in working at Sparky at which women who hadn't done
much childcare were confronted about it."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,19,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page019.txt,"Conk dialogue...

You are right about privilege in relation to working-lower class women. We are not privileged in any sense that middle class women are, and our politics and working with middle class women doesn't change that position. I know that in ten years my politics will not have changed the way I live. I was saying, however, that our politics puts us in contact with Sparky—because of that position we have primary access to it. I think my being pissed off at what I saw happening at Sparky made that somewhat unclear.

My main concern is to provide childcare for women and children on as widespread a basis as possible. Lower-working class women have the least access to childcare. In my mind, these people come first. Children who have other options and more chance to be in childcare are not my concern. It makes no difference that Teri's group has more or as many working class women as middle class women. First, she has exposure to alternate childcare situations—and second, a seven adult to one child ratio doesn't rate anywhere near the need as a one adult (mother) to one child (or more) ratio.

You say you ""got tremendously pissed at my desire to serve lower and working class women you don't yet know, when you refused to hear what lower and working class women, who you do know, wanted."" There are a couple of points I want to make about that. First, I don't want to serve working-lower class women. ""Serving"" people is romantic bullshit used by privileged groups to relieve their guilt or add a little spice to their lives. As a working class mother, I don't want your service because that means you doing it on your terms. It's like if I hear one more middle class woman say, ""Lower class people don't want charity""—I think I'll scream. You're damn right we don't want your charity—all those conditions and strings. Charity and service only are good for those dispensing it—ego trips. A good example of ""service"" or ""charity"" is what happened with Teri—no one would take her because they were supposed to—it was done to ""save"" her (social work attitude). But we do want you to do what you're supposed to do—in this case provide childcare because you have extra resources (from being childless). That means do it not because you want to for some reason but because you're supposed to. You have no right to hoard extra resources. In this society, there's no name for that kind of giving but it's not ""service"" or ""charity."" It sounds real nice to say people should serve themselves first—it doesn't have much basis in reality, however, if you're a mother—and no basis at all if you're a lower-working class person and mother. What resources do these groups of people have to serve themselves?

A second point I want to make about your statement is about the point that I have refused to hear what lower-working class women I know want. You are wrong—that is all I have heard and I'm sick of it. Mothers have been systematically shut out of Sparky and any community dealings with motherhood. ""Those women don't have time to come to meetings and anyway they'd freak out. They shouldn't be here."" I want non-mothers to quit making decisions for mothers. The working-lower class non-mothers involved in Sparky fuck me over just as much as middle class non-mothers with their childless options. Which brings me to the point about who should have control over major decisions at Sparky.

I want to point out that we do not live in a revolutionary society. Almost every child at Sparky goes home to her mother every night and ten years from now that's where that child will still be. How childless women who have no concept of what childcare involves can presume to make decisions that affect those mothers is beyond me. And everything that happens in that center affects those mothers' lives—it doesn't work out that what happens in daycare and what happens at home are two separate entities. There are all kinds of carryovers from one to the other. At this point, mothers have no reason to trust non-mothers no matter how much childcare that non-mother has done. First, the childcare that non-mothers do is so minimal and on top of that it is pretty damn atrocious. I don't know any non-mother who does childcare that doesn't do things to or with the children involved that doesn't increase the burden on the mother when the child returns. Of course, childless persons can afford to do this since they don't have to deal with the mess later (i.e., not giving children naps who need them, feeding them crap instead of balanced food, being careless with safety measures). Then there are the guilt trips laid on mothers by non-mothers. Childless persons who do childcare never have to deal with that—and they are often the ones who lay on the guilt. I could go on and on about why mothers have no reason to trust you.

It is misleading for childless persons who do childcare to call themselves non-biological mothers—the implication is that although biologically you are not mothers, in practice you are. You never will be because you'll never have to experience what mothers must—nor do I think you should have to—but non-biological mother implies that the person has struggled with her oppressiveness and come to a realization of what a mother's oppression is. No childless woman in this community has struggled. Childless women are reinforcing each other's oppressiveness and fuck-ups. You are defining how you oppress mothers and not listening to what mothers say. When you do struggle and mothers have reason to trust you, then control of major decisions should be yours too. But it is up to the mothers to define when that oppression has stopped. It's a long way off as far as I can see.

You have consistently ignored my motherhood in your criticisms. You talk rather glibly about my ""hustling supports from middle class women."" You can't see that my life and needs are not the same as yours precisely because of my motherhood. I am in the rather uncomfortable position of having to choose between: 1) living/dealing with lower-working class mothers and being oppressed because of my gayness and politics, 2) living/dealing with lower-working class, feminist, gay non-mothers and being oppressed because of my motherhood, 3) living/dealing with middle class mothers and being oppressed because of my class, or 4) living alone. Obviously, number one is out for several reasons (it is near impossible to live with only mothers with no help from non-mothers), two is out because I have yet to find a childless person of any class who wants to deal with children. Mothers already burdened with childcare are always the first and often the only ones to help out with children. I will never live alone with a child again if I can help it. The only alternative that has worked out in my life is living with a middle class mother and another woman who is middle class and dealing with childcare. It's not so easy as a pick and choose situation—when you have children it leaves you no room to be fussy. You must take what you can get. You cannot even see through to my oppression as a mother.

You can choose to ignore my needs and the needs of all mothers. And the structure is such in this community (as well as in society at large) that mothers have no power—because you have all the options to pull out anytime you wish. Mothers can do nothing without childcare. You talk about the money from our collective coming out of bounty with strings attached. Don't forget the threat you hold over every mother's head because of the bounty of energy that comes from your being childless and that you can put or not put into childcare as you choose. Mothers haven't forgotten it—it's been used on them too much.

One more thing—I'm sick of non-mothers telling me how I should think. ""The reason she wants this or that is because she still wants control over the child. After all, she's a mother and mothers are possessive. Not that they don't have reasons to be possessive..., etc."" If I say I don't feel like that you say or assume I'm lying and don't want to admit how I really feel. I can't have a valid reason for anything—I'm a mother. What it comes down to is my real reasons don't fit your plans.

As I was putting this together, it occurred to me this is a waste of time because everyone always says, ""Well, she's not talking about me. I'm struggling really hard. How can she say that?""

I want to make it clear that I do mean you—no exceptions exist in this community.

I think of material resources. It's especially when resources are low that you must serve yourself first. When you talk about correctly serving working-class mothers I assume you are talking about your own needs. That's what I mean about serving yourself first.

#4 Saying you're sick of hearing from other working and lower class women who have been making criticisms about class and homophobia is a drag. Homophobia has been making me sick all my life. Speaking about this community alone, I am sure that in 10 or 15 years queers will be oppressed in the same ways that children will go home from daycare to their mothers. In 10 or 15 years we're liable to have 24-hour daycare and mothers will be able to go on to something else, like choosing to be gay when it's convenient and choosing not to exercise a gay consciousness when it's not convenient.

#5 Heterosexual mothers and gay mothers know nothing about what affects my life and they don't much care unless, as Mary said, it is affecting or will affect the quality of the childcare they're getting. It would be nice not to make any decisions that affected mothers. It would probably be nice if mothers didn't make any decisions that affected my life. Since that's not the reality, the decisions at Sparky must be joint. Mothers, by the way, have not been ""systematically excluded"" from Sparky. There were mothers at every meeting, more at the most recent meeting than at any other. If your comment comes out of paranoia you might notice that the lesbians keep expecting to be thrown out, etc. as in the past. That is another reason for joint decisions. Trust cuts both ways.

It is not clear to me if you mean the Sparky care is minimal and atrocious. I don't think the specifics you gave are true of Sparky. There have been public struggles over mistakes and disagreements, but I wish you would clarify because it is a very serious charge. The a.m. naps (when I am there) are regular."

the children eat better than many of us ate when we were children,  
and people are systematically making repairs and watching for main-  
tenance and play hazards.  

I do not know, because I don't have to experience it, the  
quality of motherhood guilt trips, but lesbians do indeed know  
about guilt and it doesn't begin when you bear a child. It is  
precisely this kind of failure of analysts out of which comes the  
rhetoric of the-absolutely-oppressed that I think results in the  
kind of tit for tat some of us (including me) have been into.  

I think it comes out of anger and panic. Frankly, I'm not so  
hot at analysis, but I've been forced to try it in order to get  
straight what it is correct for me to do and what it is correct  
for me to demand.  

#6 I agree with you about the name Non-biological mother, for  
the reasons you gave and for others.  

There is no way I am interested in winning the trust of  
heterosexual women or newly gay mothers who are trying to fuck me  
over. The MOTHERS' MANIFESTO talks about being forced to pass  
at welfare. We're all forced to pass at times. Try it without  
a child. And what if we left it to lesbians to decide when mothers  
oppressiveness stopped...I think this again is part of a failure  
of analysis, a failure to see that you and all mothers are oppressors  
as well as oppressed.  

#7 You are right I have ignored your motherhood because I will  
not let you beat me over the head with it. You have ignored my  
oppression and the oppression of others for the same reason. When  
I talk about struggle, I'm talking about getting past this point,  
not doing childcare that you think is adequate.  

I feel pretty sure I did not use the expression 'hustle supports’  
guiltily because I was also speaking about myself. However trying  
to gap bridges when we're still screaming at each other was a mis-  
take and I'm sorry about it.  

#8 You are right I can choose to ignore your needs and the needs  
of all mothers and what I struggle with is why, under the circum-  
stances of my life, and the fact that you are choosing to  
ignore my needs, why I'm not perfectly justified to do so and fuck  
correct political analysis.  

You compare the structure of this community of 25 or so lesbians  
with the society at large! That is a failure of analysis so of-  
fensive that I don't know where to bite. You say 'mothers have no  
power—you have all the options to pull out’. Even granting that  

I have the single option to pull out, power is material. Allowing  
that we're talking about the realms all women are permitted, mot-  
hers have the power of institutionalized heterosexuality that  
enabled a handful of mothers to convince a lesbian community that  
childcare was their responsibility and then get those lesbians to  
go around saying that mothers are outnumbered and mothers are  
powerless. It is also institutional heterosexuality that controls  
the ease with which I can handle my economic life and the safety  
with which I can live my public and private life. A spin-off is  
getting your head bent.  

What you say about the 'bounty of energy that comes from being  
childless' would be funny if it weren't so serious to both of us.  
Like I said in the beginning my energy goes back into—or should  
be going into—being queer and trying to survive decently in a  
society that I have to re-create every day and which I can expect  
to have to re-create for the rest of my life. It may be correct  
for me to assume childcare responsibilities but not at the ex-  
pense of the life I've been trying to live in peace for 30 years.  
Yeah, the number of years is real important for me. It's divisive,  
and tangential and blots out the issues etc. so is being queer  
forever.  

#9 That is why I'm sick of straight women and gay mothers without  
a gay consciousness trying to force me into their world. They  
have been doing it all my life.  

Your demands, the demands of all mothers are perfectly legiti-  
mate, but don't expect me to do your bidding. You fucked me over  
before you had children and you're fucking me over now. Count on  
heterosexual women, and heterosexual identified women not to even  
notice your existence unless it's to get something off you or to  
victimize the way you live. My needs come first for me and it  
pisses me off to see the political lesbian community acting on be-  
half of straight women's needs. You're damn right I do childcare  
because it suits me. Because I'm willing to create space for Teri  
to grow in. Because the pressure I've felt from the community is  
a correct tool and being there was the correct way to struggle.  
Because if I didn't work where the community was working I would be  
isolated all over again from even the crumbs of a lesbian sub-  
culture. What are lesbians doing in institutional childcare?  
Another failure of analysis, another impasse, more pig-headedness  
from both of us. I know you mean me in your last paragraph and  
now you know I mean you and where do we go from here?"

A child I know told an adult that she was going to “bite her  
all over."" The adult later smiled at the image of hoards of child-  
ren attacking adults biting them all over their bodies. This idea  
is amazingly similar to the actions of women, united against their  
oppressors, during the Chinese revolution. I do not think the  
comparison should be taken lightly.  

Children have little or no control over money, transportation,  
their living situation, their time or energy, even their anger is  
laughed at, ignored or beat out of them. A child says something  
that is perfectly serious and is laughed at for being cute, then  
catching on, she or he tries to do it again for a laugh and is  
rebuffed. Adults talk about children as though they were little  
animals who aren't quietly hearing every word. And women who  
would like to bash in the face of men who call them chicks (baby  
chickens) continue referring to children as kids (baby goats), and  
on and on.  

Being unable to physically survive alone, children are totally  
subject to the adults that take care of them. This dependency  
falls largely on mothers who are fed large doses of mystification  
and guilt (along with who knows what else) to get them into their  
roles and keep them there in order to provide the necessary labor.  
At the same time a mother and child begin to know each other and  
special feelings build up like with a person you've been friends  
with since grade school. Generally, though, the mother has total  
responsibility for and control of the child. The mother is  
oppressed by the institution of motherhood which takes so much  
time and energy that she begins to lose herself, becoming ""Mary's  
mother"" and frequently someone's wife as well, but never a person  
in her own right. In anger and frustration she hits, pleads,  
screams, and punishes the child so she or he will be good enough  
to be worth the mother's life, and also so that the child will  
leave her alone, get off her back. The child responds to this  
overt oppression by trying to ""be good"" though she or he can  
never quite make it, by anger/screaming, crying, fighting, and by  
sneaking around to get what she or he wants. Children usually  
learn pretty fast how much or how little power they actually  
have, when to shuffle, how to get by and do the best they can, etc.  

Children are oppressed by adults and at the same time are  
used as instruments for the oppression of mothers. What should  
be a very nice friendship turns into a complicated love/hate mess.  

Many adults are beginning to relate to their passive oppres-  
sion of mothers in allowing this to happen and are doing child-  
care as one approach to changing the institution which oppresses  
mothers (and by association all women). And they are now being  
confronted with their oppression of children. Some women freak  
out when they realize that they are doing to children what has  
been done to them, they are the enemy too. Others simply dig  
in and begin to try to change things. All make mistakes.  

The first reaction is usually total permissiveness, a des-  
perate illogical fear of doing something oppressive leads to  
allowing and sometimes even encouraging children to pick up adults'  
worst habits. Children are allowed to smoke and drink beer  
(children have small livers which can't deal with these things  
very well), regulate all their own sleeping and eating habits,  
and destroy everything in sight. Coughing, sickly, grouchy,  
obnoxious tyrants begin making enormous demands on shocked adults  
who forget that children don't have all the information and exper-  
ience necessary to make many decisions, and they sometimes go  

Vl, I no, 2 and 3  

\WE MUST  

LISTEN TO  
CHILDREN’  

wild with power totally unconcerned with other people.  

The state many adults seem to be in now may be a reaction  
to this or may simply be another approach but it seems to be a  
pretty widespread situation. Having total control, many adults  
now seem to be struggling with the problem of the oppression  
of children with a different form of adult chauvinism: the child  
as a political experiment rather than a person, with the adult  
political ideology imposed on the child, not by example but by  
force: emotional and/or physical. Girls, for example, should not  
wear dresses, sounds familiar in reverse. With male children this  
sort of thing is just as devastating. The female is told it's  
good to be tough and strong and to fight for her rights “don't  
be wimpy"". He, in the next sentence, is told to be wimpy, be  
passive, wear dresses, be quiet and submissive. If she hits him  
she's applauded, if he pushes her down he's a bully. But all of  
this totally disregards two real people struggling to live togeth-  
er: fairness is often neglected in favor of a political abstrac-  
tion.  

School and television and the whole rest of the world is  
telling the male to be macho and the female to be wimpy, but  
just telling them and trying to enforce the opposite isn't  
working. She wants people to know she's a girl, she's proud of  
being female. And people rebel against being taught to be weak  
so he's lost, ignored if he's passive, rejected if he's aggressive.  
Those are the only two alternatives that we have so far been able  
to give them.  

Children don't seem to identify with our ideals, they iden-  
tify with us. They don't have all the information necessary to  
sort out the good from the bad. A friend of mine who is almost  
four years old lives with people who don't smoke. One night  
I noticed that she was picking up my cigarette butts and trying  
to smoke them, all the time I was explaining how smoking is bad  
for you. Adults need to be giving fewer criticisms to children  
and more to themselves—and each other.  

It seems necessary that all children be given love and re-  
spect and space to grow equal to their repression as a severely  
oppressed class of people. With male children this is amazingly  
difficult, perhaps because there are so many privileges attached  
to traditional male behavior and so few men who are decent models.  
For male children living within a gay women's community this can  
become especially difficult. If a male child constantly hears  
that all males are hated he will learn not only to hate himself  
but also the people who taught him. If he is constantly rejected  
simply for being male he will see no reason to struggle, or to  
try to be different. There are a few adult males who have shown  
by virtue of consistently assuming responsibility for children  
over extended periods of time that they are sincere. It seems  
that we must begin to judge their efforts with the same degree of  
trust that we hope for from children and other people that we our-  
selves oppress, putting faith in actions rather than words. Male  
children sometimes choose to relate to male adults and feel it is  
unfair that they live with all women and no men. To a gay mother  
this is a frightening problem. A child is not loved more or less  
by a mother because of what sex she or he is but simply as a  
special person with unique needs. Those needs for male children  
are often not met by other gay women except in the most limited  
ways and with some resentment, not liking, for example to be  
touched by male children but enjoying being touched by female  
children. But it seems that we teach children their roles by  
treating them differently rather than treating them as individuals  
within an oppressed class.  

It seems that we must begin to deal with our oppressiveness  
in the ways we've learned and been taught to analyze our oppres-  
sion. We must listen to children. It was a child who told me  
that he didn't like being called a kid, he only told me once. A  
screaming child is trying to say something, we must listen to  
children's anger; not demand explanations when we're criticized;  
try to share our privileges equally with children; remember that  
with children too the inability to articulate does not mean an  
inability to think or to hear and understand. We should allow  
children to spend time alone with each other, safe from eaves-  
dropping adults (although their physical safety must be consider-  
ed too); and encourage and support their unity with each other  
in struggling with their oppressors.  

With these sorts of cross references we can begin to deal  
with such everyday situations as the similarity of an adult  
ripping off a record and a child sneaking a forbidden toy. Child-  
ren cannot write down their feelings to help each other understand  
and unite against their oppression. They are totally at our  
mercy. It seems that learning to use power fairly is something  
never taught in this society, something that women are struggling  
hard to teach themselves. With children this necessity for fair-  
ness is urgent because they learn our oppressiveness as they  
suffer from it. We cannot afford to be any more liberal or less  
critical with ourselves than we are with people we consider to be  

our enemies.

A REPLY TO THE ARTICLE BY A
MIDDLE-CLASS MOTHER WHOSE
AGE AND SITUATION MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANYBODY

I'm a fourteen-year-old working-class dyke, and I hate day-
care. That's how I've always felt about it and I always fucked it
off until just a few months ago when I moved into a community
where the daycare issue was real heavy. I started doing daycare
only because I knew that if I didn't do daycare I would get shit
from every woman in the community.

It took me about a month before I started realizing my res-
ponsibilities towards other working-class women, especially the
gay feminist working-class women in my community, but I still
hate daycare.

When I do daycare, I try to look happy about it and try to
think up things for the kids to do. You might say that is hypo-
critical of me and that I should be honest with the kids. Being
honest with kids is important, but what are you supposed to say?
I hate watching you? I suppose I don't hate kidcare, period, but
doing it for 10 or 15 kids at one time with only one other vol-
unteer can really be a drag sometimes. I really think it's fucked
up to hate daycare, but watching one kid at a time is easier for
me, and more enjoyable. But I am committed to struggling and want
to get into daycare more.
I try to look at the bright side of things, like I live in a
fairly small city, and there's not a whole lot to do, and it takes

want kids, am offended by their heterosexual practices and com-
mitments.

What I want to see is free daycare everywhere for women and
their kids. Like, my mother has to take her youngest kid (out of
six) to work with her every day from early in the morning until
late at night which isn’t fair to her or him. And she has it
pretty good, because she works in a place where she can depend on
others to help her, and she won't lose her job. In most cases it’s
no job or high babysitting rates.

I think it's real important and necessary for women to be
confronted about the daycare issue because that's the only way
that anything is going to happen with daycare. That was the case
with me and others in this community. Where I grew up there wasn't
any free daycare, or anything near free. My mother shelled out
eighty bucks a month for my little brother alone. That's not
counting all the money she dished out for the rest of her six kids.
Or for the food she bought, or for the clothes she bought, or for
her own labor! Skilled workers get paid for the labor they put out
besides charges for parts, etc... and if my mother had been paid
for her 19 years of labor she would be set. Instead she got SET
six times.

When I grew up I hated babysitters and school because it
meant being around perfect strangers. I understand how kids get
freaked out about being around strange people that change several
times a day, and I think it's good for kids to relate to a group
of women, and bad to be dependent on one, like a mother. They
should be able to relate freely and not be controlled by the
mother.

We women are still the ones responsible for daycare, and
that's real shit, but if I had a kid I wouldn't want a male to be
caring for her because at this time there isn't one single male
who I think is responsible enough to not fuck her head up and give
her any bullshit lines. I'm not trying to hide the real world from
kids, but we're all around these fucked up people enough and when
kids go to public school they're going to get enough bullshit and
enough lines to last them till eternity. And also they need a pol-
itical consciousness, too, and they should get it early. They'll
need it to fight off the crap that'll be coming down on them. I
want kids to be struggling to become fighters for liberation. Kids
are sick of taking shit and pretty soon if we get our shit toget-
her it's gonna come tumbling down and people better realize it
fast. I have this vision of a revolutionary class of kids and
blacks and dykes and mothers and everybody that's gonna be TOOOOO
MUCH!

And I don't want to hear anybody who's not a kid, even oppre-
ssed mothers, tell about my oppression. I can’t get jobs, I can't
go to bars, I can’t even hitchhike, I can't drive. I’m controlled
by the snap of a finger, a signature on a paper, and the point of
a gun. And that's only a PART of my oppression. Not one word in
the ""adult"" article on children's oppression speaks of MY opp-
ression, as a 14-year-old dyke, trying to live independently. Any
adult who wants to write about kid's oppression better come to the
kids to find out, and we want every bit of the royalties, sweetie.
And I won't talk to men who come around, I'm a child, honey, and
I'm a WOMAN. AND I GET OFF ON IT!

Right now daycare is really important to me, but I still hate

up a lot of my time. And there's usually some neat women volunteers the actual work, which is unfortunate because that's what we need

around to talk to.

now. THE END.

...it is hard to face things like being

Pregnant by yourself.

Finding out you are pregnant when you
are not married is one of the most fright-
ening experiences a girl could ever go
through.

I am an unwed mother. My son is one
year of age now and I would like to express
to the readers some of my feelings throughout pregnancy.

I was 16 when I got pregnant and I had
no real parents to turn to. I went from
foster homes to other ones. The father of
my child wanted to get married but my fear
of divorce pretty much set us on two sepa-
rate paths.

I never had the problem of telling my
parents as I have already explained. But
I had sisters to tell and to me it was a
very hard thing to do. Mainly because I
had no idea how they would feel towards
me (although that really made no differ-
ence). But it is hard to face things like
being pregnant by yourself.

Throughout my pregnancy I had people
telling me to give my baby up. He would
have a better home. He would have both
parents and that I couldn't take on that
much responsibility by myself. I also had
people telling me to keep my baby. He was
my own and it would hurt me mentally if
I were to give him up.

Having all these suggestions being
pushed on you at this point is very hard
on a person.

I lived in a house with a family while
I was pregnant as I had no money. I helped
clean house and that paid for my room and
board. I ended up getting well attached
to the family and they pretty well helped
me make my decision.

The thoughts that so often entered my
head during this time were -- could I
handle the responsibility of a baby? Would
I be put down by people? Could I love my
baby without feeling a resentment toward
him because I would be more tied down?

Illegitimate children are pretty well
accepted in today's society but there are
still a few people who frown on me. Who
think I am taking on too much. Not too
many people, but those who do really don't

February [173

know me or my son.

We are both happy and I have never re-
gretted keeping him. There are times when
kids get on your nerves and I go through
those times just as every other parent
does. But that is to be expected. Kids
won't ever change -- I'm sure I did the
same when I was small.

It costs me more to live, keeping my
son, but I realized it would before I ever
gave birth to him.

I feel that if more girls were given the
choice to keep their babies or give them
up without being pushed one way or the
other -- whether they are married or not --
things would work better for the girl as
well as the baby -- because she would have
made her own decision and therefore would
not have such a resentment towards her de-
cision.

I am very happy at my decision even if
I still am considered young. Age really
doesn't matter. It's how much love you have
to offer and I feel I have more than
enough for my son."

\2 ae 2 the eg ol YY iw’ =,  

a black mother talks  

about daycare:  

Q: You were around when free daycare got started in Iowa City,  
right? I wasn't into that. Could you tell me how you heard  
about it and how you felt about it?  

A: It's hard to start out with just the free daycare movement.  

The free daycare movement seemed to come out of the other one,  

the movement with University preschools and with cooperative day-  
care, where you could give 8 hours a week and then it's free,  
otherwise it's pro-rated: the amount of money that you paid being  
according to the amount of time that you could put in. It was like  
the national movement of daycare centers, with fairly middle class  
and university women doing a daycare thing, so I guess my first  
impression is like I had of the whole movement -- it was only in-  
clusive for people like those people that started it. It didn't go  
outside the immediate group.  

Q: Could you explain in what ways you are not part of that,  
what your situation is?  

A: My situation is different in a way. Well, I am a student. I  
wasn't always a student, so in the past when daycare started I was  
not only a black woman and an unmarried woman but I was on welfare.  
That gave us a total dichotomy between myself and the people who  
ran and populated daycare centers. So, while I am a student right  
now, that's a real unimportant part of describing me. So I guess I  
would still have a major difference from the rest in being from a  
whole different background and situation from white middle class  
student women.  

Q: So they got theirs started. Did they make any overtures to  
you to get into it or anything? Or did you just know about it?  
A: Well, being black in a white university community, you do  
have a sort of pull from the more radical elements to get in-  
volved. So I was approached by the university people to partici-  
pate, and I'm sure other black women with children here have been  
wooed to participate. Mostly without success because black wo-  
men are not real hipped up on letting highly ""political"" types  
take care of their children.  

Q: So there was this dichotomy between you and the ""hip"" univer-  
sity community who were getting this together. And so they told  
you about it? Did they come and say, 'Do you want to do this?'  
or did you kinda just cool it from that or what?  

A: I guess the first people aren't the same people that we would  
be talking about if we talked about the existing Sparky community  
or something like that, because the first group of people -- ad  
hoc committees for dealing with children -- were some of the peo-  
ple who are outside the community that we talk about; but they  
were middle class women, and some of them were married and had  
black children, and I guess that's what the immediate negative  
reaction that came from single black women on campus was dealing  
with -- these people that had black children that were white, because  
it was real hard for black women to trust their kids to people  
that would take a child knowing that they couldn't give them the  
kind of future that they need, the kind of identity and everything,  
and so you aren't going to give your own kids to them to do the  
same things they're going to do to the black kids they adopted.  

So in the very beginning, back in '67, those kinds of people were  
involved in trying to set up daycare. They weren't real success-  
ful but those were the first people that approached black women.  

Q: Would you like to run down your politics about how you feel  
about that?  

A: Well, it's just that, you know, we haven't gotten to the point  
where we're all people yet. I mean, that's ridiculous. That's just  
real superfluous to talk about it even -- White middle class people,  
and even upper class, especially around here, they are professors  
and so start to leave the middle class with those kinds of salar-  
ies. But any white person hard as you might try, it's hard to fig-  
ure out what it's like to be black, and all the empathy in the  
world isn't what you need. And this child grows up and they need  
more blackness than the child in the ghetto because the child in  
the ghetto does at least see other black people. This child is  
going to grow up knowing that everything he sees good in the whole  
world is white and then there's nothing that the parent can tell  
him that's going to change that, because children see what we do  
and how we act and not what we say. So tell them that black people  
are really worthwhile and they don't even see any, you know, it  
just doesn't settle right in their stomachs. It'd be like in the  
early '60s when they said the talk about equality without doing  
anything about it, when you could tell a child that the child next  
to him was equal yet that child couldn't go into the same restau-  
rants or couldn't go to the same schools, had to go to inferior  
everything, I mean to that child the words were meaningless. And  
that's the same thing that happens to black kids that grow up in  
white families is that you can't say enough to take the place of  
what's actually going on in his life -- that he was saved from  
being in an institution by a wonderful white family that sends him  

page 24  

volume 3 numbers 2+3  

an  
interview  

to wonderful white schools to sit by nice little pretty white  
children, and then that parent is going to make some effort to say,  
you know, your difference shouldn't matter -- that right there is  
negative. It's saying even though you're not the same as us you can  
strive to be like us. The whole thing is real messed up. We haven't  
gotten to the point yet that people can take cross-cultural things  
like that. I don't think that's always the case; but it's the case  
when a person from a majority society is taking a minority child.  

I say that there's a difference because if a white child grew up in  
a black family, no matter what he lives in America, and there's  
nothing in the world like being white in America, and nothing you  
could do at home would take the place of what goes on outside in  
the world. He knows he's worthwhile 'cause he goes to school, and  
he sees the president looks just like him, v.p., and the whole damn  
senate, and there's nothing that that black family at home could  
tell that child that that whole world wouldn't erase, so you know,  
it wouldn't be the same always cross-culturally, but it definitely  
is when the child comes from a minority culture.  

Q: So those daycare centers because they were staffed by whites  
were no different from putting your child into a white family?  

A: Right. Definitely. Any daycare center staffed by white people  
would be like putting them in a white family. They cannot meet the  
needs of that child no matter how many of them there are and I see  
that even putting him in a daycare center -- another angle is that  
people ask you to bring your black child so that the white kids can  
get used to being around black children, and I think that's a real  
bunch of shit, because it's like your child isn't really a real  
person, it's a doll, you buy it for the kids to play with.  

Q: Did that actually happen? Can you describe?  

A: Oh, yes. We can start out with welfare. When I started out with  
welfare here in Iowa City, they have their own daycare centers -- well  
people -- you couldn't call them daycare centers -- babysitter centers,  
where one woman or two women takes care of a group of children from  
welfare families, and the welfare pays her. And they approached me  
because I was talking about going back to school, so that I'd have  
child care that wouldn't cost me, and the person that was sitting  
for me then, they couldn't certify her for various reasons, and the  
people that they took me to always came up with the fact that they  
thought it'd be good for the other kids to be around the little black  
child. Or if they were hesitant, they weren't sure what the other  
kids would think having a black child. It was always negative.  

They always came up with they were always happy to have him, but it  
was for the sake of the other children. This was something new and  
it'd be real fun for them. I think that’s real detrimental to  
children to be treated like they're a nonentity, and their only  
worth is in the goodness that they can bring to other people's  
lives. If you decide to do that for yourself that's one thing, but  
for other people to decide that for you, it's real strange. That's  
the way it was with the first Dum Dum and up and down Melrose Ave  
with the preschools. The attitude they took...  

Q: (Interrupting) This was supposedly from the feminist or women's  
community?  

A: Especially the further down Melrose you got like when it got  
down to Dum Dum. They were more radical than, say, Melrose Pre-  
school -- commercially run and has no pretenses to being cooperative.  
I had classes by then with people that worked at them. They were  
teaching assistants and research assistants that had talked to me  
in classes about bringing my child to daycare. Some of the people  
from that center did talk to me and said they thought it'd be good  
to have a black child in there -- the other kids, they could learn  
equality and I don't know what else they were supposed to learn.  

Q: And they'd see to it that the black child learned his lesson  
subtly. (Laughing)  

A: (Laughing) Yeah, that he was there for the service of mankind  
and not there for his own... you know, he had nothing to do with  
himself being there. He was there to be played with. Which is, I  
don't know, real strange. In those terms they would be totally  
abhorred and that's not what they had in mind. “How do our children  
learn if they're not around them?"" They learn to be racist without  
being around them, so I imagine they could probably teach 'em other  
things, too.  

Q: You're part of the community of women, made up of gay women in  
town who have for political reasons broken with those other daycare  
centers and formed another one, and yet we're still this white day-  
care center. Can you talk about how you feel about that?  

A: Well, I mean that's true, it is a white daycare center so I  
think that on a personal level -- while myself and other women that  
I know that have talked about daycare and the people that run that  
daycare center, you know, we can deal with them on a personal and  
adult level because at this point we pretty much know where we're  
at as third world women. There isn't a lot of harm that can be done."
AintIAWoman,3,2,,24,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No2_3_page024.txt,"to our psyches by them. And if I and my other friends felt it hap-

pening we'd leave; I mean, we know the difference. A child would
not. He'd be subjected to that and if we weren't around we would
not know what was happening to him in that center. People can't
help being white and being the kind of people they are. I'm not
saying that people are just mean and like driving black children
nuts, but the job gets done and intentions aren't nearly as import-
ant as the effect they're having on the children. And to have that
many--especially that place where you have 15 adults around a lot--
that many white people supervising black children--I think it'd be
bad. It's bad enough black children end up inevitably having to go
to school and having white teachers and start to get that later. I
guess we can put it off as long as we can--having white supervision.
Hopefully, we can send 'em to a school where they have black instruc-
tors but I don't think we can do that in Iowa City or even in the
state of Iowa. There are very few black instructors here. So the
possibility that you can do a lot for the child yourself before they
get to school is one out. You inevitably run into that authority
thing with white people but hopefully, by then, the child will have
some background about himself and about what to expect going to
school--things you couldn't warn 'em about when they go to daycare
at 2 or 3 years old. I guess the only relationship I can see with

white daycare centers dealing with third world children is that
it's likened to--and we can learn things from different systems--
dealing with black economic development where white people have all

the money and all black people have is human resources, you know,
and the ability, of course, to deal with each other that white
people don't have. White people can offer facilities and--when pos-
sible--financial arrangements. But most of the things they can of-
fer is usually never in the contact stage, where they come in dir-
ect contact with those people because that's just a hassle, you
know, white people haven't gotten to the point where they can deal
with black children or black people on a monetary basis without be-
coming very discriminating, and--especially monetarily--very rac-
ist. So the only thing that daycare centers that are white can
offer is space and offer some expertise--if there is any--how to
finance daycare centers, how to build them, how to apply for feder-
al funds. As far as populating the daycare center, in a position of
authority, I don't think that that should happen at all.

Q: Is there any black daycare at all in Iowa City?

A: No. They were talking about it. There is a group called

EBONY SISTERHOOD in Iowa City, of which I'm not a part 'cause
they're married. But they're talking about black daycare and
setting up something, perhaps. I'm not even sure how far they've
gone, even if they've left. Des Moines has a couple and they may
have gone down there to see how they run it (if they haven't they
should) but that's in the planning stage. Heretofore there haven't
been any black children at any age level enough to deal with it.
The transient population--here two to four years at the most--at
the time--there weren't more than 5 or 6 at any age. It's real
hard to set up a daycare center for two or three children. And the
other children who've been here forever have always participated in
staying home with their mother. (laughing) As far as black stud-
ents, other students with children, either the wife was at home or
they were both students and they would have to have a sitter be-
cause, you know, there was nothing they felt any confidence in.
With the black student population growing, I think the need for a
daycare center is becoming imminent. And they'll deal with it, but
before there hasn't been more than 10, I think, at one time, you
know, black children belonging to university students in any one
age group. So there've been very few babies around for people to
deal with. They were all either babies of a year or less or else
they were children in school.

a woman?

February 1973

Q: Do you have any feelings, being working class yourself, about
the supposed policies of Sparky to serve or give preference to
working class people? Sparky is not run by only middle class
people; there are a lot of working class people in it but I don't
know if you've ever heard anyone--like Sarah--talk about how she
was really offended when the idea came up of just serving working
class people. She thought that idea came just out of middle class
guilt and she thought that that was sort of messed up. Do you have
any feelings about that? Race may come into it so much that it may
make it an invalid question.

A: I guess to start off with I should make a statement about the
whole middle class guilt thing. It doesn't bother me so much that
middle class people feel guilty if that's not the level they stay
on. If we don’t get anything done because we think that it's
middle class guilt--that's where we get our money and that’s where
we get some ability to gather some knowledge so we can get rid of
'em. The thing is, if you're going to get as bogged down about
their guilt as they are, then, what the hell? They're bogged

down in being guilty and you don't want 'em to come over 'cause
they're guilty. You don't have no power! And that's one of the
major problems with working class and lower class people: they
don't have no power. And middle class people have some. They
don't have as much as the upper class people, but they have some
power, you know. If we could get all the power, that'd be great.
But I don't think that should stand in the way of working class
people being able to use middle class people to get the things
that they want. You don't have to stand around and hold their
hand because they're busy wanting to be flagellated because
they're guilty. The fact that they're usually very weak by the
time they get to that stage--you can channel their energies into
something useful. If they're going to stand around being guilty,
that takes up a lot of space. And the thing is, if they got
nothing better to do, then find something for them to do.

Q: So, like a daycare center would be finding something for

them to do...

A: The thing is that middle class people with little money can
volunteer their time. Working class people can't. They're gonna
starve if they don't work. So you can't say, ""We don't want them
around 'cause they're guilty, we'll go off and start our own day-
care center."" The problem is, without any money working class peo-
ple can't do that 'cause they can't spare the time to sit around all
day watching their kids. They might as well be home if they're
going to watch their kids. And they could do that at home and
watch T.V. The thing is: you've gotta be able to use the re-
sources that are available. And, if you have to--just speaking
on a total level of white people: upper, middle, and lower class,
not coming in with a racial thing but just as a class thing--the
only thing the lower class has that it can use is manipulation.
And they've got to be able to manipulate those other classes to
get power, to get money, so they can survive. It's not just getting
money so you can count on it, but getting money so you can eat;
getting your fair share of the pie and the Gross National Product
that everyone's so proud of and that lower class people are getting
none of and making all of for those big people. If I could get some
rich person's money I'd feel good; I wouldn't turn my back and walk
away 'cause he was rich. Being poor, no matter what anybody says, I
don't think is very much fun. I see nothing to smile about when
you're hungry. Lower class people with children don't like to see
their kids go hungry, don't like to see every Christmas go by with
their children having nothing, and their days in school start
with nothing. That may look like a lot of fun and virtuous to
people who are middle class and are poor because they feel like
being it for 4 years in school. Turning your back on people be-
cause they're middle class is a real luxury in itself. It says
something about where your head is and that's just not where most
working class people are that are really working class. Because,
if you can manipulate those people, by God, do it. I think that
starting daycare centers and getting money from middle class
people and being able to use them, and if you're going to use

them in your daycare center and you don't like their politics,
get rid of the ones that you can, but talk to those other ones.
You should be able to tell 'em exactly what you want 'em to do

and let 'em do it, because if you're really working class--that's
it, you're off working--you're not sitting at a daycare center.
By all means, don't just say, ""because they're there I'll let 'em
run my kids crazy because they're middle class."" Manipulate 'em,
talk to 'em; there's an education level. Tell 'em exactly what
you want 'em to do with the kids, what you don't want 'em to do
and then, if they don't like that, fine. I think you should have
something to say over how they deal with your kids. They should
not have anything to say over how the money's spent. Use their
expertise, if they know something you don't. Working class people
and lower class people don't have resources because it's been kept
away from them. To throw away a chance at a resource, I think is
pretty foolhardy.

Gladys pissed her pants so she could have
a different change of clothes.

You of,

Max the Gorilla lives in Sparky's Basement

child proof your home!

Every house or apartment should be safe for
kids - whether kids live there or not.

When I take kids someplace that's set up 
with only adults in mind, it means more work
for me - watching the kids closely and there
is no reason for endangering the life or
health of a child. 

SOME THOUGHTS TO KEEP IN MIND:

The twins suddenly started saying this in response to any request
even though their grandmothers live miles away and they see them
about twice a year.

Alice and Sam were fighting all the time, Alice is the daughter
of a feminist, gay woman and already has quite a consciousness.

A bunch of women here had a talent show
to raise money for Sparky. Lots of kids came
and ran around making noise which was
a hassle at times. I was in the wings
eyeing a winner across the way.
She was fidgeting, so Mary put her hands
over her mouth. After she quieted down and
Mary removed her hands, the twither kept
her own hands plastered across her face
with a bewildered expression that cracked
me up.

Teri and I were riding in the car, and she was asking me
a whole string of why questions, like she was always doing then.
I'd give an answer and she'd say, ""Why?"" Then I'd explain that, and
she'd say ""Why?"" again.

I was trying to be real patient,
but pretty soon I got exasperated and said, ""Teri, why do you
say WHY all the time?""
She looked at me with this proud look on
her face and said, ""I say why ALL DAY LONG!!!""

BIG PERSON: ""Why is the potty clogged?""
LITTLE MARY: ""Because Joe flushed his
underpants down it.""

Teri has been raised on health food, and isn't allowed
candy or coke or things that aren't good for her.

At a birthday party the other week she was gorging herself on
cake, popcorn, punch, and anything else she could get her
hands on.

One time I went upstairs and passed her sitting
alone on the landing stuffing popcorn into her mouth saying
over and over, ""Shit food! Shit food! Shit food!""

Don't keep cleaners and other poisonous 
stuff under the sink. Put all that stuff up
high, out of reach or locked up. 
Everyone knows they're supposed to keep
medicine out of kids' reach but often don't 
do it. Put a lock on your medicine cabinet. 
Put razor blades in there too.

Keep small dangerous items off the floor
that babies might put in their mouths.
Tape over wall sockets not being used.
Put electrical cords out of reach.

Take knobs off gas stoves.

Always turn handles of pans in so they
don't stick out past the edge of the stove.

She doesn't like Sam much, but it got to the point where we had to
cool some of the fighting between them.
Alice invented a game called 'ghost' where she'd walk around with Sam holding an
oversized plastic play hammer looking for ghosts.
Alice said, ""Sam, there's a ghost on your back.""
Then Alice said, ""Well, we'd better get
him."" He said, ""ohhh?""

What a con job!

Afterwards Gladys said, ""ok and I'll
Then looking at the space
...'Where's the potty?""

Jeffrey has chapped
because all his shirts
are too short and on the
other uptraws he dogs it.

""I DON'T WANT to go potty!""

I'm in love with Gladys which has nothing to do
with the price of beans especially if you don't know
her or her twin sister. They are three years old and
remind me of Groucho and Harpo Marx. They're real
funny and seem to be spoofing everybody. I walked
into daycare yesterday feeling pretty sick. I had
diarrhea. Teri said she had it too. She's three
and whines and cries a lot but is a tough little
woman in her own way. She said her diarrhea was
a drag which is what I tell her about her crying
and what she tells me in return about everything.

I tried to lay down on the couch but Gladys jumped
and crawled all over me saying, ""I eat diarrhea.""
Meanwhile Maria and Sidney (adults) were talking
about the women's talent show that was coming up.

All of a sudden Alice and Mary (2 four-year-olds)
closed the big wooden doors between the living room
and the hall and stairway that leads upstairs. Then
they opened them and began their own women's talent
show with Alice's quirky movie act full of punches and
strong movements and some theme centered around beat-
ing up a man, eating him and vomiting him up. Alice
and Mary did a lot of dancing and Gladys and Jane joined
in. They all fought the boys off their stage and made
them sit in the audience. It was great. Sam is four
and he freaked out about not being able to be in the
show. Joe is two and didn't really understand the dia-
lectics of what was happening but put on a baseball cap
and stalked away. I love those kids.

Put sharp knives up high.
For babies that crawl, put gates on
stairs or have some way of blocking them.

Don't leave water in a bathtub. Drain off.

Put locks on basement doors or any
doors leading to stairs.

Paint, turpentine and other ""basement
stuff"" that's poisonous should be put out
of reach even if you think kids won't be in
the basement.

Get rid of tablecloth type things that
can be pulled down. Heavy things fall on
kids that way."

The first issue contains readings from the Liberation News Service, The  
Whe Eargh Catalogue, The Mother Earth News, The Rolling Stone, and several other radical or underground sources.  

Our purpose is two-fold. We are available to read anything the blind or illiterate are hassled with getting through conventional channels. We also hope to become a focus for an embryonic handicapped person's liberation movement.  

We need lots of publicity. The group of people we hope to reach is not presently part of any organization, so we must depend on readers of the underground press to turn their blind friends on to our service. We would appreciate a small continuing spot in your paper. We would be ecstatic with a free subscription and could perhaps work out an exchange.

Since we put out The Childcare Issue in February we've been
through a lot of changes. The situation regarding childcare has
changed considerably here and the childcare issue had repercussions
in this town that were threatening to people's safety and security.
We hope that in the next issue there will be more about childcare
and that we can deal with some of the changes this community has
been through.

This issue was originally to be one on violence and women. It
really isn't. After the childcare issue we were hesitant to put
out an issue solely about violence -- afraid of the repercussions
it could have for women in this town. We also received Jane Alpert's
article and felt that it and the responses to it warranted the space
it would take since anyone underground is so limited from normal
means of communication.

In between putting out the childcare issue and this issue, we
sent copies of a women's poetry anthology to our subscribers.
The anthology was published by a group of gay women and includes
poems read at the first and second All Women's Poetry Readings in

April 23, 1973
Dear Sisters,

I really enjoyed your childcare issue...
and found it somewhat fascinating that
nothing else could get done due to all of
the struggles over who's going to take
care of the children. I've had fantasies
myself of interrupting any and all meetings
in my area with mobs of children so that
nothing could get done until ""who's going
to take care of the children"" got dealt
with a little better. However, I no longer
(at this moment) feel quite like that is
the best approach for (where I live).

I'm getting off the track.

Here are some of my thoughts

ON CHILDCARE
What do we mean when we say as mothers
that we need help with caring for the
children? And I tell a two-year-old who is
visiting our house with his mother ""no,
you can't have that jar full of peanuts""

Iowa City. The same group of women have started a women's press.
We're excited about both the book and the press. If you didn't
get the anthology and would like one they are $1. The next issue
of AIAW we expect to print ourselves on the press. So it may take
some time but should be out this summer.

and take out a few to give to him...and
his mother rushes from the hall to his de-
fense and she takes over administering
what he can and can't have...not able to
trust that anybody but she can truly be
properly concerned for her child's welfare.

And why is it that when some children
are left with other people they totally
freak out and cry constantly. I don't
think that it is natural for babies to be
so attached to their mothers and I feel
that we (as mothers) are at least as re-
sponsible as other people that children
aren't more able to be raised collectively.
..actually I'm not trying to place blame...
but too often there is a cry by mothers
that nobody else sees what needs to be done
in order to care for their baby/child prop-
erly...there is a presumption by everyone
(including the mother) that mother knows
best and although she's found out everything
that she knows about what affects her child
(ie why she/he won't eat; why she/he's cry-
ing; etc) has been through trial and error...
still other people aren't allowed that same
process and instead if mother is around she
unconsciously acts as the all-knowing re-
garding ""her"" child.

It is hard to fight the privatization of
children. But first we are recognizing that
they are privatized...and then we are

struggling with changing that. I hope that
in your future issues you will have more
on ""who takes care of the children.""

I live in a flat with four adults and
three children. There are often as many as
six neighborhood children. And we have a
couple of overnight switching so that who

that your father used to kill
your mother.

It is yours.

It is your inheritance.

Take revenge on this putrid
patriarchal world.

Your mother's murder is part of

Your father is one of the everyday
murderers.

Seek revenge, Kathy.

Am I being followed?

What is that noise?

Planning my karate attacks.

If he's tall—kick him in the shins.

And do an elbow punch to his stomach.

If he's short—go for his eyes.

If he comes up behind me, smash his instep.

I hate it.

I hate it.

I hate the need to always be conscious of
my survival.

In my house.

Lock the doors.

Don't take a bath when no one else is home.

I try to ignore the cats which sound like
murders, rapists, intruders.
Watching kids—doubles, triples,
multiplies by thousands.
The caution.
The fear.
The need to protect.
What if something happened to one of them?
Can I really defend them and me?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
This constant fear.

And no one did.
Pure luck.

My fear of men is so deep-rooted.
So real.

Hundreds of men every day pass through the
cafeteria line.

And I think any one of these men

Could be a murderer.

The murderer of the student nurse who was
killed in her dorm room over spring
break.

Almost every one of these men

Is a personal threat to my life.

They hate women.

Want us destroyed.

They are so helpless and stupid.

""How do you get coffee?""

""Can I give you 3¢?""

""How does the creamer work?""

""I have the change""—and I know he hardly
ever does.

They spill things all the time.

And they take their inability to function

in this world

As a natural expected phenomenon.

They turn their inferiority into hatred.

Choose your weapons
And use your anger well.

Become a woman-loving woman. Newark and NYC.

I used to walk down the streets of

Brute obnoxiousness.
Slamming the money down.

Become strong and learn to resist: ""Alone; Throwing it all over
men, leading a quacking toy duck on a string."" When I told one of the men, half-smiling,

And help us blow their world

PARANOIA

What I hate most about being
a woman

Is the unavoidable

Almost always present paranoia.

Every day.

Every day watching

Keeping my sixth sense of woman's

Alive and alert.

Walking down the street.

Where are all the cars?

Is anyone in them?

What's in that alley?

Pretending I was crazy
So maybe no one would bother me.

""Oh, it's so nice you're so maternal.”
Everything of theirs is a distortion!

Their hatred.
Their envy of women.

Not as a toy in my head.

“The Enormous Contradiction
We Have Sold Ourselves”

The murder and suicide of Pat Cone and her ex-husband, respec-
tively, in Lone Tree last week is too ""close to home"" both liter-
ally (because she worked and had friends here in Iowa City) and sym-
bolically (because every woman has seen and/or felt violence done
by a man or men to her or a woman close to her) for us to just let
it go by.

At the same time we saw the repeated fatal beatings, stranglings,
shootings of women by men close to them (we hear/see it on the
radio, TV, and newspapers every day) not as isolated incidents or
peculiar private crimes but as the product of the values our soc-
iety cherishes and promotes.

Males are socialized to see violence towards others, espec-
ially females, as a sign of affection. Females are socialized to
disarm their natural, self-protective instincts and to accept that
""VIOLENCE=LOVE"" double-think as truth. For males in our culture,
violence serves two purposes: (1) as a defense and outlet for
hostility and (2) as a love message, a way of communicating af-
fection (or deep caring). ""I can't live without you,"" so popular
in our songs and romantic myths translates easily into: ""so I'll
die unless I can have you."" Similarly, ""I don't want you to live
without me"" becomes ""I'll kill you if you leave me.""

In school and families around the time of puberty, girls are
taught to double-think when violence is done to them by boys, to not
react naturally and fight back, but rather to interpret a boy's
hitting them as ""he loves me!"" This brainwashing is an important
factor in preventing a woman from taking action to stop a man's
hurting her. Similarly, it works as an effective stop to anyone
else's interfering when a man is seen—say, on the street—hitting
a woman. Onlookers assume that because it is or may be a lover's
quarrel, it's ""their business"" only.

Even the laws enforce that kind of mentality. In most states
there has been legal support of men's violent crimes against wives

A Woman?

June

22, 1973

or female lovers. Men's crimes in these cases usually take a
lesser penalty—manslaughter, for example, in the event of the
woman's death; whereas women's slaying their husbands or male
lovers often is seen as murder in the first degree. In some states,
even with the same charge, a woman has gotten a stiffer sentence
for her ""family crime.""

The enormous contradiction we have sold ourselves—that some-
one is beating someone else because he loves her—puts women who
relate to violent male lovers (this is, sooner or later, most men
in our society) in the hideous double-bind of always hoping for
affection from the person who physically abuses her. How can she
prevent her own harm? He might be nice tonight when he comes
home, so, she reasons, she shouldn't leave or call on friends or
the police to deter him from hurting her. Anticipating his vio-
lence might bring it down on her, she fears. And, anyway, he
may beat me a little when he's upset but he's never seriously hurt
me.

Violence is violence. We should not see ""slapping her around
a little” as different in kind (only in degree) from the violence
that ends in fatal beatings, stranglings, knifings, shootings.
Everything begins little. Extreme violence is not exceptional; it
is the natural escalation of small violent acts.

The number and frequency of beatings and other violent crimes
as a cause of women's deaths in this society are so common as to
be ignored as an unchangeable part of ""the way things are.""

But nothing is unchangeable. We need all women to get together
with other women you know to talk about male violence against
yourselves or women close to you.
Sharing that grief and anger will help us understand what we live/
have lived under, and will help us decide how to put an end to that
oppression.

The story of Goldflower is well-known in China. A woman badly
abused by her husband, Goldflower gained support in ""speak bitter-
ness"" meetings with other wives in her town. As a group, they
warned Goldflower's husband that violence has no place in his
treatment of his wife. Still, he beat her. Then the women of the
town went together to his house and beat him. Convinced, he changed
his behavior; so did other men in the town.

Violence is no kin to loving. We must not lie to ourselves
about that anymore. We must teach our children the truth, too.

We must enforce our demand that violence against women stop. To do
that we must begin where we are, now."

Dedicated to Sarah Ottens  

Our goal is to regain control of our own bodies and lives.  
Yet, I am always amused and often greatly irritated to  
hear claims that the women's movement seeks to  
emasculate men. I should like to point out the irony of it.  
Women’s bodies have been subjected to men’s  
imaginations and manipulations for centuries.  

There were the pre-revolutionary Chinese who broke  
their women’s feet and socialized them into believing they  
were more beautiful that way when in reality they had  
fixed it so that their women could never run away from  
their slave positions.  

There were Moslem men who buried their women under  
veils and robes in the sweltering desert sun in order to  
inhibit their own sexual desires.  

There were the American bluecoats who sliced the  
genitals of Indian men and women, wearing the women's  
genitals on their hats for sport.  

There were the tortures of chastity belts, those iron girdles  
which not only prevented a woman's freedom of  
choice, but which were unbearable, cold contraptions  
which collected filth and disease. Women were left at home  
burning with disease while their Christian soldiers were  
raping Moslem women or lying dead on battlefields, the  
chastity belts’ keys gone forever.  

Freud managed to further louse things up for women by  
subjecting their psyches to his male interpretations of  
female sexuality. Post-Freudian doctors operated on  
women, removing their clitorises so they would experience  
the vaginal orgasms that Freud thought to be more mature  
than the “immature” clitoral orgasms.  

There were women who, because of church doctrine,  
were burned as witches, who died or suffered from forced  
motherhood or in the hands of illegal abortionists because  
the patriarchal church banned birth control and abortion.  
All these, not to mention countless women past and present  
in all societies who have been subjected by men to  
beatings, rape, murder and prostitution.  

Certainly when I think of all these inhuman,  
premeditated cruelties that women's bodies have endured  
due to whims of their menfolk, I must laugh in rage against  
some man's fear of being emasculated. When I dream of  
the inner rage of women collectively coming together for a  
purpose, and think: **Castration?’’...It would be too kind.  

The demystified Fortress  

Then,  

If I stole your armor,  
Your tron suit, lance,  
Face guards, epaulets,  
And put them in the Museum  
Under the Tower  
Where I secretly practiced  
Wearing them.  

I even perfected  
Your signature  

On my death warrant,  
Daddy,  
ALL of you aromatre,  
Robins-egg blue.  

Then I sat in the glass Tower  
Wondering if you could see me  
without my tron vest  

Or red wig; like Queen Bess  
Imagined letting your severed head  
Bleed over my velvet robe.  

--Barbara Unger  

Due to a pregnancy I was married at 19. My groom was 22. Men-  
tally and emotionally we were both children. During the first two  

years of my marriage I was slapped and knocked around quite often.  

Usually it happened when I could no longer keep my mouth shut and  
became ""bitchy"" about the fact that I was always home alone while  
he was out drinking or playing poker or with his girlfriend.  

Once he hit me while I was attempting to learn how to drive ""be-  
cause I was so stupid."" The encounter that I remember most vividly  
occurred the night I brought my child home from the hospital. It  
had never occurred to me to ask his permission to breastfeed my  
baby. It seems he had some fucked up hang-up about nursing. He  
claimed that he didn't want anyone sucking on my tits but him.  

I was completely intimidated and changed immediately to the bottle  
method. I never even considered nursing my second child. I had  

a black eye for two weeks that I received after a party for yelling  
at him in front of his friends about having an affair.  

For a long time I never said anything to anyone except my clos-  
est friend. Everyone who knew him thought him a gentle and kind  
person. During this time I never fought back. I just cowered and  
cried. I think I felt that the shame he later felt each time was  
my strongest weapon. At some point I couldn't stand it any longer  
and started to hit back. That may have happened twice before the  
violence ceased for good. I told him if he ever touched me again  
I would leave him. It took me four more years to get my shit to-  
gether to do that but it wasn't due to violence. Once during that  
time I confessed all this to some women who were also married.  

They all admitted similar experiences that they had never discussed  
before.  

Why this is not talked about, I'm not sure. I imagine most  
women are trying to protect their husbands, their marriages; mostly  
it is a real loss of face in suburban circles to admit that you are  
unhappy. I was never actually beat up, just knocked around. Some  
women are not so lucky and still nobody is talking. The taboo  
against admitting all this is so great that even now I find it in-  
credibly difficult to write this article.  

It's really bad but I kind of have an attitude that goes along the lines of straight  
women who are assaulted by their boyfriends and still continue to relate to them are  
stupid and there doesn't seem to be much I can do about it. I mean if they continue  
to allow themselves to be fucked over (and I see being fucked over as a form of vio-  
lence) and especially hit, then I can’t see a road open for me to even begin to bring  
them down. I don't know how to tell someone to take that first step. I see that as es-  
sential to dealing with women and violence. Women are going to have to retaliate and I  

Page 4  

know if I'm putting my life on that kind of line, it's not going to be for someone who  
will go and do the same thing over again.  

I want revenge and I deserve it but the revenge I seek is (1) personal against men  
that fuck lesbians over (2) political i.e. maybe it will give women courage to do some-  
thing about the violence they themselves are subjected to. I want men everywhere to  
be afraid of women in the same manner women are afraid of men. Men are not going to  
take this fear on voluntarily, they are going to have to be subjected to women's rage  
and not to one woman's rage but to women as a whole. I want the guy that I pass on a  
dark street late at night to be as afraid  

the morning and hear on the news that a man  
was found castrated in an alley every time I  
hear that a woman has been raped. I am para-  
noid and scared shitless of men because I  
know their violence that is directed toward  
women comes from a basic premise that women  
are lesser persons than they are and will  
not be able to harass them as much as a  
man (an equal) can so it's no sweat - no  
sweat to bat them around a bit. Well, they  
have got to learn that we are persons, we  
tried the education, dissertation, kissing  
ass, methods and women are still getting  
abused constantly so every day it becomes  
more and more apparent that direct physi-  
cal assault is the only answer."

a new feminist theory

PART I: An Open Letter to the Weatherwomen

Dear Sisters in the Weather Underground:

I am addressing this piece to you, in spite of the fact that my
concern at this point is with a far broader spectrum of women than
your tiny band of forgotten leftists, because it was our arguments
of the past year that convinced me to publicize my conversion from
the left to radical feminism. I realized after these arguments that
for me to keep silence would only support the illusion that the
""underground"" is united around the male politics which you still
espouse, and these politics and practices are too reprehensible to
me as a feminist to protect them by silence. I know that seeing
this letter - which you thought you would receive as a private com-
munication - here in print will shock you and that you will regard
much of its contents as a breach of the tacit code of honor among
political fugitives. Nevertheless, my own politics demand that I
share with all women my knowledge of the sexual oppression of the
left, if only to warn other sisters against the pain that has been
inflicted on us. Perhaps you personally will never open up to fem-
inism; yet the experiences I am going to relate may speak more ef-
fectively to women involved in other branches of the left, from
McGovern organizers to Socialist Workers Party members. And I have
some hope that the impact of a public statement may do what none of
my private arguments have succeeded in doing: persuade you to leave
the dying left in which you are floundering and begin to put your
immense courage and unique skills to work for women - for yourselves.

Since this is an open letter, let me summarize for other women
what you already know of my history underground and as a feminist.
I became a fugitive in May 1970, a few days before my scheduled
sentencing for conspiracy to bomb military and war-related corpor-
ate buildings in Manhattan. I was never part of SDS or of Weather-
man, and although I'd had conversations with Weatherpeople which
were influential in my decision to go underground rather than to
prison, I lost contact with the organization shortly after I became
a fugitive. I was a serious militant leftist at that time, and the
most feminist activity I'd ever been involved with was the all-
women’s newspaper Rat, which, despite its exclusion of men, re-
mained thoroughly left-identified. In the last three years I have
become a radical feminist. The change in my politics has not been
sudden, and I want to go into its causes and its substance much
more fully later in this paper. For now, I only want to set the
scene of my renewed acquaintance with the Weather Underground by
saying that when it occurred I was decisively through with the left
and had, at least mentally, rededicated myself to the cause of a
revolution made by and for women.

It was in this general frame of mind then, just about a year ago,
that I was attending a public lecture and, a few minutes after seat-
ing myself, noticed a man sitting nearby who looked vaguely famil-
iar. I would not have noticed him at all except for the fact that
he was very obviously staring at me and at the same time making
laughing, surprised comments to the people around him. I thought
with some alarm that he must be either an agent or a dangerous fool,
and I was both more and less apprehensive when I finally realized
who he was.

It was Mark Rudd.

After I recovered from the shock, I became excited by this rare
and unhoped-for opportunity to share experiences with a fellow
fugitive and for a short time I relished it in spite of the prob-
lems. Rudd was living with a woman I hadn't met before, whom I'll
call Caroline. She seemed to be a strong and sensitive person and
I would have loved to get to know her well, independently of Rudd
himself. This was not possible because Rudd made it difficult for
us to see each other without him, and because when the three of us
were together he made a practice of interrupting her and seemed to
regard himself as the spokesman for them both. Nevertheless, his
obvious dependence on her combined with his frequent apologies to
me for his manipulative behavior in past years (toward me in par-
ticular and women in general) gave me some hope that he had funda-
mentally changed and might even have become a sympathetic ally to
the Women's Movement. I was soon disillusioned.

What finally woke me to the reality of this man's character was
a conversation we had while Caroline was out of town. He made a
special point of wanting to get together with me at this time and,
as we were sitting on the front seat of a car on a rainy evening,
he attempted to put our relationship on a more intimate footing
by means of the following confession. He told me that approximate-
ly a year earlier Caroline had had a serious ovarian infection
which made sex very painful for her. This, he said, was the root
of a whole range of ""problems"" in their relationship, ranging from
his virtually raping her (he couldn't help himself, he said) to
his imagining himself in love with another woman. He described to
me how titillating he found it that this other woman looked on him
as a revolutionary hero, how she excited him sexually without sat-
isfying him intellectually, how he couldn't resist the excitement
of an affair with her though it was causing great anguish to Caro-
line. The affair ended, however, when he learned that the ""other""
woman was pregnant by him and that she wanted to have his child.
He regarded the pregnancy as entirely her own fault, since she had
stopped taking birth-control pills without telling him, and he ex-
plained that this willful and self-destructive carelessness - as he
saw it - was what had proved to him that ""a man can't politically
educate a woman."" It slowly dawned on me that Rudd was telling me
this story (1) because it proved what an irresistibly highly-sexed
masculine creature he was, and (2) because as a ""liberated woman,""
not to mention a presumably pro-abortion feminist, he quite sin-
cerely expected me to cluck a sympathetic tongue over his problems
with this dumb chick.

I told Rudd in the strongest terms of which I was capable how
appalling his behavior was to me, but though my failure to sympa-
thize seemed to startle him, nothing I could say would convince
him of the seriousness with which I regarded his crimes. ""Of course
I trust you,"" were his benevolently paternalistic last words to
me. ""I know you wouldn't do something like those Boston women who
denounced Eric Mann (a Weatherman who served a two-year prison
term) as a sexist pig who deserved his imprisonment.""

While it wasn't possible for me to establish much of a relation-
ship with Caroline given the short time we were in the same geo-
logical area and Rudd's obtuse omnipresence, I could at least look
forward to getting in touch, through Rudd, with women in the Wea-
ther Underground. I was wary about this because I knew you Weather-
women had never given a sign, publicly or privately, of being more
receptive to a feminist point of view than Rudd himself was; that
you had never risked the esteem of leftist men in any statement or
action; and that the few statements of your organization which
made reference to the Women's Movement revealed a complete failure
to understand it and an intense eagerness to co-opt it. Neverthe-
less, I respected - and respect - you in a way I never could Rudd.
I knew it was your strength that had held the organization together
when the men's desperate egomania threatened to destroy you all. I
could count on the fact that as women - and specifically as women
fugitives - we shared certain experiences that could bring us
closer together in outlook and feelings than would be possible
with even the most sympathetic and sensitive man. Finally, what-
ever the risk, it seemed well worth it if I could give even one
woman in our situation support that would help her stand up for
herself, and for all women, against our oppression in a movement
that puts our interests last. Encouragingly, my very first meeting
with one of you was a wonderful experience for me, and I was much
moved by the warm reception and attention this woman gave me and
my politics, and the genuine respect that I felt from her as well
as for her. (I suspect now, in the aftermath of other meetings,
that this may have been partly because she was unprepared for the
radical changes in my politics and therefore responded to me open-
ly and honestly. The rest of you had, in advance of meeting me,
already armored yourselves against revealing too much of your
""personal problems"" as women in a male organization.) For whatever
reason, I was, as it turned out, all too ready to plunge into a dia-
logue in which I used my own skin as wallpaper while you side-
stepped and evaded every issue.

Your resistance to discussing your personal experience, your
trivializing of your own pain and suffering, your insistence that
the oppression of others is more important than your own - these
are part of the self-contempt that has been bred in all of us wo-
men, and I understand it as I understand myself. I can even deal
with your more contrived evasions, the ones that were obviously
developed only after years of building defenses against the threat
that the Women's Movement seems to you. I can see why you over-
looked security so that, apparently by chance, I ran into one more
Weatherwoman than we had agreed I would meet during the brief time
we were together, a woman who just ""happened to be"" rabidly anti-
feminist. I know what advantage you saw in circulating a vicious,
unfounded rumor about a well-known feminist and then asserting she
herself was not to blame for her errors because the Women's Move-
ment was responsible for her psychological destruction. I can un-
derstand too well the reasons for your flippant claim that it
""bores"" you to talk about men, a pathetic way to avoid admitting
your oppression.

But the wall I cannot surmount is your insistence that if I
really practiced sisterhood I wouldn't make demands on you in the
name of feminism, but would respect your political path as equally
valid to my own. You want me to accept your claim that you are no
longer dominated by men, as you admit you were when you first
joined Weatherman, as in fact we all are as long as we live under
patriarchy. Yet in the same breath that you claim, ""Women run the
organization,"" you admit that of the five members of the Weather-
man Central Committee, three are men. And you have no shame in
telling me that one of these three is Bill Ayers, notorious for his
callous treatment and abandonment of Diana Oughton before her
death and for his generally fickle and high-handed treatment of
women; and that another is Jeff Jones, who once told that dull-
witted misogynist Robert Palmer that if I thought Weatherman was
a male supremacist organization, I could ""suck his dick."" Or have
Ayers and Jones now become feminists too - like Mark Rudd, who,
after a year's leave to overcome his ""arrogance and insensitivity""
(which you won't even call by its true name: sexism) you are ad-
mitting back into the organization?

The politico-feminist split is a real one, one that will vanish
as soon as we accept ourselves as women first of all, but which
will continue to divide us until we share that consciousness. It
is you leftists, you male-identified socialist and liberal and
pacifist and Weather-sympathizing women, who try to deny any sig-
nificant difference between male politics and feminist politics.
""We're all just women,"" you say, and we are - but to you this is
a phenomenon of the most peripheral possible interest, indeed it
only seems to occur to you when under fire from feminists. As long
as you are working politically with men, as long as you are letting
men define your attitudes, behavior and standards, then we stand
on opposite sides of a line all too visible to me in spite of your
blindness to it, but which I know you too will see once you have
crossed it. And to cross it you need do only one thing: let your
own self-interest be your highest priority. I am not asking you
to stop loving men, or to break all personal and emotional ties
with the men who are important to you. I know that those ties are
more..."
AintIAWoman,3,4,"JUNE 22, 1973",6,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page006.txt,"never broken out of a simplistic political decision but only when  
and if consciousness of oppression makes them so inconsistent with  
self-respect that they can no longer be borne. Even then it is  
with enormous pain and grief and in spite of an ever-reluctant  
part of ourselves that we separate from men we have cared for. I  
firmly believe that one can be a serious feminist and still live  
with and relate to a man and to men. The gulf that is between us  
is not that, but rather that you allow men to rule on your politics.  

Believe me, I understand your side of it. I've been on that  
side - I've practically drowned on that side. Over a year ago I  
wrote an introduction to a book of the prison letters of Sam Nel-  
ville, a man I loved and lived with who was killed in the Attica  
uprising of September 1971. I was already a feminist when I wrote  
that introduction and had theoretically rejected the politics that  
Melville had taught me and that he had lived and died for. Yet I  
had never found the courage or the words to tell him that while he  
lived, and especially while influenced by the powerful feelings  
that his murder aroused in me, I was incapable of writing the  
truth of his male supremacy - that underside of men's lives that  
only women know - in my eulogistic essay on his life. Since this  
is the last time I will ever write about him, I would like to tell  
some of that truth here.  

CoyW  

I was very much pressured, against my own sense of tactics and  
timing, into playing the role I did in the group of radical bombers  
Melville half-led, half-dragged along with him. The pressure was  
of the kind peculiar and common to male-female relationships: he  
constantly threatened to leave me if I backed out. What he valued  
in me, besides having a dependable sexual partner and housekeeper,  
was what he took to be my ""independence"" and ""self-sufficiency"" -  
as he often told me. This made me useful to him as an ally, and  
further assured him that I had the quality he prized above all  
others in women: the capacity to love him devotedly, yet get along  
without him uncomplainingly whenever he chose to leave. The last  
letter I received from him exhorted me against writing narrow-  
mindedly of loving and needing him, instead of writing about great  
social truths (the ones he was concerned with, that is). ""To speak  
of love, especially love between one desperate man and woman, limits  
our vision and ties us to the past."" Yet the same letter ends on  
an explicitly sexual note: ""Yes, sweet bitch, I love you. And if  
they ever let me out and the wind is right, I'll find you."" This  
was typical; he would never ""degrade"" himself by admitting love  
for a woman in any fashion not immediately tied to his sexual  
pleasure.  

A few months before we were arrested, Sam began a secret affair  
with a woman friend of ours whom I hadn't seen in some time. In  
order to keep us from comparing notes on his behavior, he told her  
he was no longer living with me. He also at least hinted to her  
that the sabotage of military and corporate buildings around the  
city was the work of himself and friends. I discovered his betray-  
al only by the coincidence of having acquaintances in common with  
the other woman, acquaintances to whom she had repeated Sam's  
hints. To this day I don't know how many other dangerous, possibly  
fatal, violations of security his masculinist need to boast led  
him to commit.  

Some will say Melville's sexism was extreme just as his politics  
were extreme. Yet I have seen his behavior duplicated in the most  
bourgeois households by males of all political persuasions, econ-  
omic backgrounds, ages and skin colors. I never knew Sam to cook  
a meal for himself; he once wrote WASH ME in black magic marker  
on the side of the refrigerator as a cute reminder of my responsi-  
bilities; he threatened to leave me, and meant it, if I took up  
smoking cigarettes after having given them up to please him; he  
wouldn't allow our lease, our telephone, our utilities bill, our  
bank account or anything else we shared to be in his name on the  
ostensible grounds that he was delinquent with his income tax and  
didn't want to be found through public records. The real reason,  
it turned out, was that he didn't want his wife to find him and  
demand the child support he owed her and hadn't paid in years.  

He was sexually impotent unless he could fantasize the woman  
he was with as a prostitute and she went along with his fantasy.  

At one point Sam joined a political group headed by Rap Brown.  
This group's attitude toward women was bigotry itself: they didn't  
include any and they didn't intend to. According to Brown himself,  
as quoted by Melville, women would be ""a distraction from serious  
business."" When I confronted Sam on this, he seemed slightly en-  
barrassed but wouldn't even commit himself to discussing male su-  
premacy with his new idol, Rap Brown. Recalling this, I'm reminded  
ironically of the division of all-Black bomber pilots stationed  
out of Texas during World War II who, despite phenomenal sacri-  
fices and heroism were forbidden the supposed privilege of being  
integrated with White battalions. How strange it is that not only  
the man I lived with but one of the most brilliant and sophisto-  
cated Black militants of the 1960s should turn out to have the  
same kind of crass ignorance about women.  

And so, my sisters in Weatherman, you fast and organize and  
demonstrate for Attica. Don't send me news clippings about it,  
don't tell me how much those deaths moved you.  

I will mourn the loss of 42 male supremacists no longer.

Part II: The Education of a Feminist At-Large  

My first year underground was very hard. Expecting to die for  
the Revolution in a matter of months, I was unprepared to find my-  
self not only alive but living a rather unadventurous and secluded  
existence less than a year after ""disappearing."" I found it in-  
creasingly difficult to get along with the friends with whom I was  
still in touch, especially with the men who were becoming increas-  
ingly overbearing and critical of my actions, as I was growing in-  
creasingly sensitive to their interference. Chafing at every re-  
striction, hostile even to the one woman friend I really cared for,  
I finally decided to take off on my own, reasoning that it couldn't  
get much worse. I started to travel and for a few months just  
roamed, almost aimlessly, from one community to another across the  
country.  

As I traveled, I slowly became aware that nothing was less rele-  
vant to the lives of most people in this country than the white  
left, with which I still identified myself. The leftist (and right-  
ist, for that matter) distinctions between working class and ruling  
class, hippies and straight people, youth and Establishment, all  
seemed increasingly absurd to me. They seemed to determine nothing  
of certainty about anyone's attitude or political outlook. As I  
moved around I could see more clearly than ever the oppression of  
Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican and Indian peoples. Yet at the same  
time I was learning concretely that women existed in well-defined  
subcultures within each White and Third World community. Finally  
all my experiences kept reminding me of one fact of my own identity  
I was continually trying to forget: that I was a woman. Men, Third  
World and otherwise, young and old, hippie and straight, related to  
me as Woman, all my other interests or characteristics being, in  
their eyes, mere modifications of that one essential. Whether I was  
desired, rejected, abused, admired, ignored, treated with kindness  
or hostility, it was basically because I was a female doing whatever  
it was I was doing. Women generally took their cue of how to relate  
to me from the way men related to me, or I to men. It occurred to  
me that this was no different from the way people I had known for  
years had related to me but because we had known each other well I  
had been aware of the subtleties in our relationships to the point  
of being blind to the underlying structure. Of course I had heard  
feminists express these perceptions before, and had even asserted  
them myself occasionally, but I had never internalized them. I now  
began to think that if my politics were to be based on my own situ-  
ation and not on someone else's perception of reality, I would have  
to deal with the fact that the rest of the world thought of me as a  
woman first of all, before it even listened to what I had to say.  

Together with these discoveries, I began to realize the astonish-  
ing impact the Women's Movement has had over the U.S. in just a few  
years. I could see women everywhere, White, Black, Brown, Indian,  
responding in their daily lives to the fact that some woman some-  
where had said, ""Men oppress us."" I came to know Chicana women liv-  
ing in a barrio who were organizing women's health care programs  
and women's antirape squadrons to patrol their own neighborhood.  

A White woman, mother of three, from a poor Southern family and on  
welfare, talked to me with great eloquence about how she saw the  
courts, the police, the welfare system and her ex-husband as all  
part of the same male-run system, which women needed to take over  
and run for their own benefit. A woman I met who had been born  
into a wealthy and traditional Japanese family told me she was  
filing for divorce against a husband who physically and mentally  
abused her because she refused to go through life suffering from  
the same causes her mother and grandmother had before her. These  
women - all random examples - would not necessarily say or think  
that they were part of the Women's Movement. But they demonstrated  
to me, among others, that the changing consciousness represented  
by the Women's Movement has been more far-reaching than any public-  
opinion poll on Women's Liberation would seem to show. As for the  
frequently heard opinion that Third World women support Third  
World liberation but not Women's Liberation, I believe that this  

is true chiefly of a few women who are highly regarded by Third  
World male radicals and hence are considered newsworthy by the  
media. Among the majority of Third World women, it seems to me  

that the Women's Movement is spreading and its ideas are having  
increasing effect, just as among White women.  

The turning point of my personal rapprochement with feminism  
came when, a year after I'd left New York as a fugitive, I joined  
a women's tap group composed of a half-dozen other women, of wide-  
ly different economic backgrounds, ages and family situations,  
brought together only by our common desire - or desperate need -  
to talk with other women about our lives. No one in the group  
knew who I was, or that I was wanted on a federal warrant. I know,  
though, that they all sensed my unspoken inner turmoil (if not the  
specific causes of it) and in response gave me more positive emo-  
tional and intellectual support than I could have imagined possi-  
ble from a group of strangers. They sustained me through the crisis  
I underwent after Melville's murder and the dramatic upheavals  
in my consciousness involved in that experience. Eventually, when  
a series of circumstances forced me to leave the area in which I'd  
come to know them, they gave me, as a group, the help and strength  
I needed to face yet another move into the unknown.  

The process of the consciousness-raising group, for me and for  
the other women involved, was one in which we began to be able to  
define ourselves as individuals and as women. Some of us had pre-  
viously conceived of ourselves as exceptional women, some of us  
thought being female necessarily meant being passive and dependent,  

Responses to Jane Alpert by five Iowa City Dykes follow this article.  

a woman?  

but it soon became clear that we had come to the group each in a  
private panic of no longer knowing who we were. What we discovered  
in each other was the pulse of a culture and a consciousness which  
was common to us as women. We discovered it as something that had  
always been there, but that we had not previously recognized or  
felt able to trust. Trusting it - or gaining confidence in our  
thoughts, feelings, resentments, desires and intuitions as attri-  
butes that we shared as a people and which were therefore valid -  
became the basis of beginning to trust ourselves as individuals.  

I believe that the struggle to define oneself for oneself ulti-  
mately takes place in a realm of the mind in which one is always  
alone and unsupported. For some women the existence of a women's  
group or even a Women's Movement has not been a necessary precon-  
dition of that struggle. Individual women of genius - artists,  
scientists, philosophers, activists and visionaries - have left us  
written and other evidence to prove that throughout the history of  
patriarchy some women have found it possible to call upon their  
inner powers to create and achieve and succeed. For each of these  
women, many others who were unable to leave us records have man-  
aged to define their individuality and assert themselves in the  
face of enormous male hostility. And yet the evidence we have  
proves ultimately only that no matter how many obstacles are in  
the way, a few women will possess the ability, determination and  
special privilege to overcome them. In considering social change  
it is of much more significance that today's Women's Movement has  
encouraged thousands of women who would never have done so before  
to discover and develop their unique talents, and to stand up  
against male prerogatives and values with originality and courage.  
Moreover, as increasing numbers of women are turning to art, sci-  
ence and other creative efforts, a truly female - that is, a fem-  
inist - culture is beginning to take shape. It seems little short  
of miraculous that with so little in the way of facilities - still  
very few research grants, little access to the best laboratories,  
to substantial publishing contracts and the like, our own culture  
has nevertheless managed to take root and flourish. Feminist news-  
papers, literary magazines, cooperative childcare centers, anthro-  
pology collectives, legal clinics, poetry workshops, self-help  
medical clinics, counseling services, music groups and graphics  
collectives are a few of the new-born alternative institutions  
providing the access for women whose values and vision are unac-  
ceptable to the patriarchy, or who choose not to pay the artistic  
and emotional price exacted by men in exchange for a share of  
male privilege. Even more significantly, the products of these al-  
ternative institutions (and of the individual women involved with  
them or working on their own) are qualitatively different from the  
products of men and male institutions. For instance, a feminist  
all-women's rock band sounds different from a male rock band or  
from an all-women's rock band trying to reproduce male music; they  
are not only singing different lyrics but the melodies and harmon-  
ies and rhythms are different. Feminist anthropologists are ap-  
proaching their subject from a different perspective and with dif-  
ferent assumptions than male anthropologists, or women anthropolo-  
gists in the past who had only male-defined standards and methods  
at their disposal. Feminist teachers are creating a different style  
of classroom situation with their women students. Feminist lawyers  
are helping their clients to use the law to help themselves. All of  
us are not engaged in such activities but many of us share in the  
changing consciousness that these women are expressing publicly.  
And in light of the accomplishments already generated from this  
changing consciousness, I think we need to take another look not  
only at the old male-supremacist assumptions about women's ""nature""  
but also at some of the assertions of the Women's Movement so far.  
Just what is the powerful source of this consciousness?  

For centuries feminists have asserted that the essential differ-  
ence between women and men does not lie in biology but rather in  
the roles that patriarchal societies (men) have required each sex  
to play. The motivation for this assertion is obvious: women's bi-  
ology has always been used to justify women's oppression. As patri-  
archal reasoning went, since ""God"" or ""nature"" or ""evolution"" had  
made woman the bearer and nurser of the species, it logically fol-  
lowed that she should stay home with the children and perform as a  
matter of more-or-less ordained duty all the domestic chores invol-  
ved in keeping and feeding a household. When women work outside the  
home we have the most menial and lowest-paid tasks to perform,  
chiefly because any labor a woman performs outside the home is  
thought to be temporary and inessential to her, no matter how she  
herself might be inclined to regard it. Naturally then, the first  
healthy impulse of feminism is to deny that simply because women  
have breasts or uteruses we are better suited to wash dishes, scrub  
floors or change diapers. As newly-roused feminists, we retorted to  
evidence that women might be intrinsically better suited to perform  
some roles than others by pointing out that men have been forcing  
these roles on us for at least five thousand years. After such time  
conditioning and habit are so strong that they appear to be intrin-  
sic and innate.  

However, a flaw in this feminist argument has persisted: it con-  
tradicts our felt experience of the biological difference between  
the sexes as one of immense significance. To begin with, it seems  
obvious that biology alone would, in primitive societies, have dic-  
tated different roles and different powers as appropriate to each  
sex. And biological scientists have indeed assumed, for the most  
part, that the physical passivity of the female mammal during inter-  
course and the demands of pregnancy, childbirth and nursing clearly  
indicate the role of women as biologically determined, and inferior.  
In response to this, Shulamith Firestone, with the publication of  
The Dialectic of Sex in 1970, articulated the definitive feminist  
antithesis to this idea by"
AintIAWoman,3,4,"JUNE 22, 1973",7,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page007.txt,"and strongest in women, and as we begin to define ourselves as  
women, the qualities coming to the fore are the same ones a mother  
projects in the best kind of nurturing relationship to a child:  
empathy, intuitiveness, adaptability, awareness of growth as a  
process rather than as goal-ended, inventiveness, protective feel-  
ings towards others and a capacity to respond emotionally as well  
as rationally. If matriarchy means a society in which these are  
the qualities all human beings admire and strive to embody, a so-  
ciety in which the paradigm for all social relationships is the  
relationship of a healthy and secure mother to her child, then  
matriarchy means nothing less than the end of oppression.  

Interestingly enough, the materialist analysis brings us to  
conclusions similar to the ones I have just set forth from an  
idealist standpoint. In the Marxist dialectical-materialist view  
of history, the ""vanguard"" of the ""revolutionary class"" is that  
group which is not only greatly exploited by the class in power  
but which is also performing labor essential to the functioning  
of society. The ruling class is thereby forced to respond to de-  
mands which it puts forth in the name of the oppressed. A third  
requirement is that the class be potentially collective; each mem-  
ber should not be severely isolated from every other. In classical  
Marxism, the ""revolutionary vanguard"" is composed of the ""indus-  
trial proletariat"" who must sell their labor to the capitalists  
in order to eat, whose labor is essential to industry and there-  
fore to society, and whose work process is socialized. No revolu-  
tion founded on Marxist principles has adhered to the classic pat-  
tern: in Russia the proletariat was a tiny minority with no influ-  
ence at the time of the Bolshevik revolution, and Mao had to re-  
write both Marx and Lenin to suit Chinese conditions, defining the  
peasantry as the ""vanguard"" in that context. The industrial prole-  
tariat in the U.S. today are a larger group than in either pre-  
revolutionary Russia or prerevolutionary China, but are not, by  
and large, an exploited one. Through unions they have acquired a  
significant share of power, and their right-wing views do not  
spring from ""false class consciousness"" but rather from a hard-  
nosed sense of their own self-interest. Taken alone, Third World  
male industrial workers are much less privileged, and women in  
industry are the most exploited of all of these in respect to both  
wages and working conditions; but these very divisions of the  
""proletariat"" show the obstacles to its solidarity more pointedly  
than anything else. However, if, with Firestone, we transfer our  
focus from economics to sex, that is, from production to repro-  
duction, the Marxist terminology itself begins to make more sense.  
For there is very clearly a large group of women who by reason  
both of exploitation and importance to the society perfectly an-  
swer the requirements of the vanguard, and who are increasingly  
closely in touch with one another. These women are, of course,  
mothers.  

Mothers live by their labor yet generally without standardized  
wages. If they have husbands who earn good money and are generous,  
they are amply supplied - but only as long as they can keep their  
husbands. Otherwise, they have little or nothing outside the nec-  
essities and whatever they do have goes to their children first.  
The only mothers who do earn a standard wage for the labor of  
child-rearing are those on welfare, and that pay is barely enough  
to sustain life. The job is without guarantees of security of any  
kind. Its workday is twenty-four hours, workweek seven days, no  
vacations, no holidays. Total dedication to the job is expected,  
and yet a woman who works ""only"" in the home is regarded, with  
some contempt, as an unemployed housewife. Women with children are  
the women who most frequently suffer from fatigue, headaches, list-  
lessness, depression, insomnia, digestive disorders, loss of ener-  
gy, nervous tension and other illnesses common to women. If the  
women who work in factories were all replaced by men, it would rep-  
resent some economic cost to industry but no alteration in the  
power structure or the basic assumptions of society concerning sex  
and class roles. The labor of these same women in the home, how-  
ever - and of all women who work at child-rearing, whether of their  
own children, adopted children or someone else's children for wages  
- cannot be replaced on a mass scale without cataclysmic changes in  
the social structure.  

Mothers are a distinctly defined group. Nevertheless, their in-  
terests as a group are in no way opposed to the interests of women  
as a whole, but are rather intimately linked with these. For mo-  
therhood itself is only the concrete expression of that potential  
which defines all women. Accordingly the domestic situation of  
women underlies the way we are treated on the job market. But the  
point of Mother Right is to reshape the family according to the  
perceptions of women, and to reshape the society in the image of  
this new matriarchal family. Because motherhood cuts across econ-  
omic class, race and sexual preference, a society in which women  
were powerful by virtue of being mothers would not be divided  
along any of these lines. Nor would any new division between women,  
such as between mothers and childless women, arise, because the  
root of motherhood and the root of female consciousness are, I  
believe, the same.  

Returning to my personal experience again, my self-interest in  
changing society is bound up with that of women who have children  
much more deeply than it is, for example, with women demanding  
equal pay for equal work, despite the fact that I am single, child-  
less and must work to support myself. If I had to sum up in a few  
words what I feel to be my own oppression in this society, I would  
say, ""The enormous economic, social and psychological obstacles  
against bearing and raising children of my own."" While my situation  
as a fugitive seems to all but eliminate any hope that I might  
raise a child of my own, even these unusual circumstances are only  
slightly more handicapping than those any other woman faces when  
contemplating motherhood without marriage, or at least a stable  
relationship to a man. These obstacles and the tools to overcome  
them are beginning to be studied and developed by many different  
women, notably by Lesbians who have or want to have children. The  
oppression suffered by women whose sexual preference is for other  
women is peculiar to patriarchy, it seems to me, and would be elim-  
inated as soon as women cease to be pawns in male power games. If  
Mother Right were the informing principle of society, it would make  

8 volume 3 number 4  

no difference whether a woman lived with men or women, let alone  
with whom she slept. A woman would be powerful and respected simply  
as a woman, and particularly esteemed as a mother, regardless of  
whom she lived with. For far from being in a position to exploit  

a woman because she chose to live and/or sleep with other women, a  
man would consider himself fortunate if a woman only chose to live  
and/or sleep with him.  

The conditions of life in the patriarchy are such that the over-  
whelming majority of women in the foreseeable future will continue  
to marry and raise children and to regard that role as the central  
one in their lives. This majority includes millions of women who  
also have jobs outside their homes. The Women's Movement is their  
movement not only because they are a majority, but because feminist  
consciousness springs directly from the role they play in society.  
Many segments of the Women's Movement are now beginning to implicit-  
ly recognize this truth and act upon it. N.O.W. is making a major  
push to speak to the needs of housewives by agitating for an end  
to discrimination against married women by banks, insurance compan-  
ies and credit unions. Radical feminists are demanding less that  
women leave men, and suggesting that it might be more effective in  
building a revolutionary base if women instead move to become heads  
of their families. Outside the consciously political segment of  
the Women's Movement, housewives are beginning to unite and to agi-  
tate for their common interests, starting with lower food prices.  
More mothers are expressing their dissatisfactions and talking  
about their problems, while not necessarily seeing these as rela-  
ted to the Women's Movement; more women within the Movement are  
beginning to experience their feelings as mothers as feelings  
which are integral to their identities as women. Demands relating  
to jobs, professional opportunities and electoral representation  
will continue to be important, partly because the unequal treatment  
of women in these areas makes people aware of women's overall in-  
ferior status, and partly because increasing numbers of women  
want and need to support themselves with jobs outside the home.  

But the Women's Movement must, and will, begin to focus on those  
demands which relate concretely to women's role in child-rearing.  
These more radical-feminist demands include: wages for all women  
engaged in child-rearing; paid holidays and vacations; collective  
child-care centers controlled by mothers with the participation  

of all members of the community, including fathers, older children  
and childless adults; laboratories and research facilities to be  
turned over to feminist scientists so that research into contra-  
ception, fertility, pregnancy and birth can be conducted in women's  
interests; hospital and outpatient facilities related to women's  
health to be run and staffed by women; self-help clinics, financed  
by the government but under community control; artificial insemin-  
ation, sterilization procedures, facilities for extra-uterine birth,  
and related technology to be made widely available. Technology is  
a powerful tool which will free us to bear and raise our children  
in our own way at our own time. It must be turned over to women  
now, in order to prevent its becoming an even more powerful weapon  
against us and indeed against all life.  

It is the uprising of women which will presage the end of op-  
pression, but this uprising must be based on more than opposition  
to oppression and the definition of Woman as Other. It must be an  
affirmation of the power of female consciousness, of the Mother.  
The changes which it will embody can perhaps be better imagined  
as primarily spiritual and religious, rather than economic and  
social, though they will include and embody the latter. Thus a more  
apt analogy than the Cuban or Chinese revolutions might be the Ref-  
ormation or the Christian revolution, or perhaps the revolution  
made by the patriarchy itself when the ancient gynocracies were  
invaded. I use these analogies because in each of these cases the  
economic and political changes were enormous, but they followed  
rather than preceded sweeping changes in human consciousness. The  
ripples spread through the institutions from the masses of people,  
rather than the other way around.  

These were not, and never will be, gentle ripples. The oppress-  
or is equipped with the tools of mechanized violence as never be-  
fore; we are only beginning to reclaim the ancient rage that will  
defeat his evil. Feminism is teaching us, again, the healing power  
of anger trained on the true enemies of ourselves and our children,  
and our anger will supply us the resources we will need against  
the Man's weapons. Yet, from another point of view, we may remind  
ourselves that the violence of this cataclysm is no more nor less  
than the outward sign of a struggle of the human spirit. It seems  
very significant to me that simultaneously with the contemporary  
rise of feminism, there is a great rise of interest in psychic and  
spiritual phenomena. Because the Women's Movement gets lumped with  
the left in many people's minds, it is mistakenly regarded as  
narrowly ""political."" Yet feminism concerns more than political  
power, essential as that is. It is closely tied to theories of  
awakening consciousness, of creation and rebirth and of the essen-  
tial oneness of the universe - teachings which lie at the heart of  
all Goddess-worshiping religions.  

We are on the threshold of what all the ancient wisdoms, many  
of them handed down from matriarchal times, teach is a new age of  
consciousness and simultaneously on what seems scientifically to  
be a threshold in the evolution of the species, as the genetic  
code is broken and life produced in the laboratory. Could it not  
be that just at the moment masculinity has brought us to the brink  
of nuclear destruction or ecological suicide, women are beginning  
to rise in response to the Mother's call to save Her planet and  
create instead the next stage of evolution? Can our revolution  
mean anything else than the reversion of social and economic con-  
trol to Her representatives among Womankind, and the resumption  
of Her worship on the face of the Earth? Do we dare demand less?

Dear Jane,  
“I was very glad to receive your communication. Glad also that you are well and to hear of your political conversion.

I was impressed by your analysis. It was new to me, but I could see it had been thoroughly thought out.

Later as I was thinking about it, I wondered what is the purpose of such an analysis, even though I have read them, written them, been excited by just this type of far-reaching analysis before. Maybe it was that it didn't touch me personally enough because I am a lesbian and we are prevented from even vicariously enjoying our mother-right.

That is the context in which I was thinking. What good does it do to determine who the vanguard is? Does the act of determining them make them rise up? Do communications have to be directed to them to raise their consciousness about being oppressed so that can happen?

If they know they are the vanguard, what do they do? Pick up weapons we do not know how to use because we are women? Or will it be more of a general strike? All women refusing to take care of children and bringing things to a halt this Lysistrata way.

There are other things I question. It seems to me that even though you don't identify with women struggling for equal pay for equal work, this is a more widespread and gut-level interest among women than mother-right. Especially among working-class women where pay differential is more crucial.

Yes, I agree women in the movement are beginning to experience their feelings as mothers, but I don't know that this is any more integral to our identities as women than women becoming in tune with their feelings of love and sexuality for other women. Certainly you would agree that these feelings must have been a part of the culture of the gynarchies and Amazon nations of long ago. What Elizabeth Gould Davis is describing in The First Sex reminds me of the culture Sappho nurtured on the island of Lesbos.

I'm not saying that I have the right analysis and yours is wrong. But I've learned in dealing with analysis and direction that if you don't have the answers, questions are the next best thing. The inability to tolerate different perspectives from different oppressed groups of people is a problem the women's movement has. Different groups of women can work to form their own interests, but they must consider and deal with the oppressions of the other groups i.e., class, race, gayness, motherhood, age, etc. Maybe this is why I don't tend to think in terms of vanguards. Probably different groups have different conceptions of who the vanguard is. If I thought in these terms I would name lesbians as the vanguard.

I can imagine where you are in your head because I was there. The excitement of realizing the dynamic of feminism as a basis for social revolution. But I find it ironic that I am maybe closer to where you were originally (politically) and you are now closer to where I was. I don't know. I think it would be a shame if you let the talents you learned in Weatherman slide before you taught them to other women.

With every mention of mother-right in your article, my body tenses and strains to hold in all the hysterical anger and repulsion that term evokes in me. I hate the term, Jane, and everything it means to me is worse than Mark Rudd or Sam Melville. You claim this mother-right as a basis of some kind of liberating direction for all women, but I know in my gut I am left out of that. Before I knew I was gay, I knew I didn't want to reproduce myself—the thought repulsed me more than any fears my childhood saw. My ability to reproduce means nothing to me and I don't want my ability to mean anything to anyone else either.

Within this society and the reality we all live, certain situations are going to mean certain kinds of oppression for women. Relating to and living with men is going to be oppressive, having children is going to be oppressive, and so are a lot of other things. But, the two things I mentioned we have more control over (we can choose not to do) unlike other things (jobs for instance) that we don't have much choice over. A gay mother wrote in an article for our last issue on childcare that she thought there was a choice involved in having a child but that that choice did not justify her oppression. I agree with that. I don't think women who relate to men or women who have children deserve what they get. What I am trying to say is they do get what they could have intelligently expected and gawd damn we know we have so much to do to arrive anywhere close to freedom. I wish we would stop wasting our time choosing a situation which will according to our own analysis oppress us. Buy a gun every time you experience your mother instinct—whatever the hell that is and I don't know what the hell it is. I have never felt it. Where do I fit into your future society? As a mother's helper? Fuck that.

I am aware that you have been influenced by The First Sex. It seems to be the rage. I haven't read it but have been real unhappy with what people have been thinking and talking about having been influenced by that book. I am in no way interested in recreating the past. I don't understand why anybody is interested in being biologically superior to anyone. That is a distasteful line of thought.

The feelings I'm expressing are very personal and involve what I want my role in any society to be. But I haven't spoken to the point that many women like yourself want to have children. That is a right I think any woman should have if she wants it. How that would be accomplished without the now-present accompanying oppression in some post-revolutionary society can only be speculative. But the present is real and upholding a woman's right to childbirth means a lot to childless women. It means that childless women must help a lot to avoid a mother being oppressed because she is a mother. It is free labor and because a mother still has property rights over her child (and I should add that with the recent adulation of mother-right it is sanctioned) the labor put in by childless women for mothers is exploited.

What the issue of childcare has done to all of us is push us to attempt to achieve some post-revolutionary state without having made any material changes in society—to set personal behavior codes that are unreachable. The attempts frustrate all of us and stagnate us. Attempting the impossible I do not find admirable. I think it kills and destroys human potential. And I want to repeat again that even though I do see the oppression of mothers and see its unjustness, the property right that mothers (especially recently, movement mothers) understandably cling to is exploitative to childless women. Especially exploitative to those childless women who mothers confront and guilt-trip into doing childcare. I do believe that mothers' demands on childless women are justified when you consider the oppression that mothers suffer and the help they need, but the subject of property rights was never fully considered and many mothers insisted on wanting to deny such rights only later under the influence of the glory of mother-right to take up their right again and hurt many childless women who developed attachments to their children by taking the children away.

We tried to deal with motherhood and childcare. We had a daycare center where childless gay women worked and other non-institutional childcare arrangements were made. They weren't perfect and people made mistakes, arguments between mothers and non-mothers, straight and gay women were heated but I think people were trying. In the end we discovered what we knew from the beginning: gay women are not allowed to do childcare in this society and mothers have all the power regarding their own children. The result of all of this remains to be seen. The center closed because of county and state investigations and threat of custody suits, mothers are still overburdened and do not trust childless women and childless women feel used.

So I do worry about your whole theory primarily because of my identity and the experiences I have had. I hope this is understandable.

P.S. I should try and make it clear that when I speak of property rights and power—in fact everything I spoke to, I am speaking within the context of a women's community and so refer to the relationships that exist within that community. I am well aware that mothers, although having more power in regard to their own children than childless women, most often have less power than men and always less than the state.

AintIAWoman,3,4,"JUNE 22, 1973",9,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No4_page009.txt,"dear jane,

I don't know how exactly to respond to your theory of mother
right as the basis for feminist revolution. I find it to be something I very much disagree with and with increasing intensity each
time I read your letter, but it is hard for me to sort out where
that feeling is coming from--whether it comes from personally being
fucked over by mother right or from real revulsion at the idea
of motherhood being so glorified. Probably, it comes from both.

I think what hits me most about your article is its inherent
heterosexuality and the picture it paints of a post-feminist
revolutionary society which gives little or no indication of not
being the same entrenched heterosexual world. I think at the basis
of your theory of mother right is the assumption that women
are heterosexual beings. Obviously, motherhood, at least for now
(and you give little indication and/or support of development of
artificial reproduction techniques that can free women from their
biology) implies that at some point in time in a woman's life she
was fucking with a man. By saying that the basis of a woman's
powers and the source of feminist revolution is the capacity for
motherhood, you are inextricably linking women to men in this
society, in any revolutionary struggle, and in the future society
of matriarchy that you envision. I think such a theory comes out
of your belief ""that one can be a serious feminist and still live
with and relate to a man and to men,"" a notion which I reject as
totally contradictory and which I hope you will come some day to
reject too. I am linking your notion of mother right so strongly
with heterosexuality because you talk of motherhood in a
future matriarchal society as coming from where it has come from
now and in the past--through fucking with men. The change in
reproduction methods brought on by technology that you only vaguely
refer to, means, at least to me, the possibility of an essentially
motherless and fatherless society; that men and women would
play an equal role, or perhaps even no role, in the creation of a
human being and that society would collectively be responsible
for the embryonic development and upon birth, the nurturing and
raising of the child.

Another sort of major disagreement I have with your letter is
that the whole idea of motherhood and the values of motherhood
as you see them--protectiveness, intuitiveness, adaptability--
sort of makes my stomach turn. I do not feel and cannot relate
to my oppression as a woman in this society as being one of an
inability to raise children. Rather, I feel my oppression at
least partially as being because of that ability and my attempts
to reject the glorification of motherhood that is foisted on me
everywhere and now even with the women's movement. Where does
your idea of motherhood as the moving force of the revolution
leave women, particularly lesbians, who cannot fit into the role
of mother--who both emotionally and intellectually abhor the
thought of bearing and raising children? Where is our place in
this new society?

I want to say something too about the importance of women's
history. The knowledge of the position of women in ancient matriarchal cultures I find very exciting because it gives me a
sense of a history of women as being strong and powerful and controlling--how I envision women in a future society. I think this
knowledge is very important in building a women's movement because it gives women a sense of where we have come from. What
scares me about books like The First Sex is the reaction to it--
that feminists are turning to the concept of matriarchy as being
the new vision or goal of feminist revolution. I think it is a
mistake and even reactionary to transform the basis of ancient
women-controlled societies to that of post-revolutionary society
of the twentieth or 21st century or whenever and to see the same
source of power in ancient cultures as being the source of women's
power today. It scares me because it is coming dangerously close
to accepting values which have been the source of women's oppression for thousands of years and at a time in which we are on
the very brink of being able to do away with that very fact which
has oppressed women for so many years--our ability to bear children.
It is that which you idealize and which I reject. I want to live
in a society in which women are totally free to determine their
lives. I don't want a society in which I am a mother, in actuality
or not, first.

These are some of my thoughts on your article, Jane. I hope
they are of some help to you in thinking out your ideas. Take
care of yourself.

In sisterhood and struggle, B.

When the rage spreads above my eyelids
in that debilitating form
for a while I don't recognize that
weeping is the last turn inward for my heat.
I forget that it has crept by then
from my community to myself
without burning even the fingers
of those who are the cause of it.

It isn't the tears so much I mind,
but the fact that not long ago
when anger against the women
with whom I work and sleep
was hotter than anger against the cop-callers,
queer-baiters and fuckers of every description,
I flared at the careless word of a friend.

In a cold spring night I fumed,
Learning finally that if I loosen the teeth of a malicious woman
or if I choke, until her eyes pop,
the neck of a slippery-mouthed woman,
I hurt them for our mutual enemies;
learning that if I smolder into a night that burns back
because of a woman I love,
the cop-callers, queer-baiters and fuckers of every description
gather in soft victories.

And so this spring, almost this very day

I kicked the first fucker who passed on that street
and before I was finished

I knew what I needed to know.

The fat lesbian bitches

ugly lesbian whores

filthy bull dykes

who fight to clear a living space
that all women will occupy

are freeing us

from the touches and pokes,

the small indignities

we suffered as girls.

Young women will no longer sulk
when little boys pull their hair
or smile when bigger boys

pinch their asses.

They will not make the mistake

of thinking nuisances will go away
if they are ignored.

On your own street

if you do not know

On whose head to bring down

a tire iron,

if you do not, if you cannot
stand with the fat ugly filthy
whores and lesbians

who are drawing overdue blood
then defend them

against the mind bending that
tries to discredit them

for taking offense where
offense was intended.

When even small lines are drawn
give praise to women

who are clearing ground

on which we will all live.

Dear Jane Alpert,

One of the claims that your letter makes is that ruling class males are not going to give us anything we ask for or turn over to us anything we demand. It is that mother right cuts across many important lines, including sex preference. Obviously, there are lesbians who have children, some who want to have children, some who long for them if only the world wasn't the way it is, and some who do not now and never have wanted children. I am a woman from the last group, and I want to try to tell you why your analysis is offensive to me and why I think it is incorrect in general.

The religious fervor of mother right as described in your letter sounds no different to me than the ruling class propaganda about the myth of motherhood. It takes the ideology which grows out of ""biology is destiny"" and attempts to glorify it into ""biology is power."" That is my first gripe. It has a familiar ring--all women will serve as a useful resource in a revolutionary society.

It is cruel to encourage white middle-class women to bear children. I also feel that what you say about the ""few options for meaningful participation"" available to childless women that aren't available to mothers points up a big gap. First, it is clear you are not talking about lower-class women with men and without children. Second, women without children are outside of ""meaningful participation."" Women generally do so after failing to respond to all hints, are at least capable of being mothers. You could as well and as truly argue that all women are potentially lesbians. Class and sex preference are both descriptions that limit possibilities for women, especially when you are talking about a post-revolutionary vision. At present, your analysis neglects to mention the enormous complications that mother right presents regarding institutionalized heterosexuality, men, and male children.

It is idealistic to talk about methods of impregnation without men before women have seized power. I am stunned by your statement that ""Radical feminists are demanding less that women leave men, and suggesting that it might be more effective in building a revolutionary base if women in our experiences."" Further, the demands that you enumerate, about wages, vacations, holidays, research facilities, hospitals, and clinics ""financed by the government"" no less, are idle dreams. In this country, you have been in the field.

Dear Jane,

There are many things in your article that disturb me and make me angry. As I read it, I question these areas of your thought: your concept of revolution, your concept of children, and your concept of womanhood.

To start with the last one first, it is probably obvious that I would have to disagree with you about your projected concept of womanhood because you evidently are still straight and I am a Dyke. There are subterranean hints in your article that indicate a sympathy toward lesbians, and maybe you are moving toward that place yourself, just as you moved from old left heterosexuality to radical feminist (heterosexuality? celibacy? I don't want to guess or try to define you without more words from you). The most glaring example of our differences arises out of your definition of feminist culture's base: “...feminist culture is based on what is best and strongest in women, and as we begin to define ourselves as women, the qualities coming to the fore are the same ones a mother projects in the best kind of nurturing relationship to a child."" I would agree with the ""based on what is best and strongest in women"" part, but as for the rest I strongly take exception. To use as a prototype a mother/child relationship, even the best kind as you describe it, is miles from my experience of valuable relationships with women. As I see it, the only working definition of ""best kind"" that we can come up with in this society (including counter-culture living arrangements of all kinds) is still distant, powerful, one-sided, and oblivious to the deep struggle/love mutuality that can exist between women. Because you rely on the mother/child relationship as basic, you have to take into account the necessary age difference that also exists, and I think it is safe to say that we haven't been able to even begin to bridge the age differences and chauvinism that exist in social relationships today. If you mean some kind of post-revolutionary vision of a mother/child relationship, I still think you are misguided because I seriously question whether post-revolutionary conditions will even embody a mother/child relationship as we think of it now. Later in that same paragraph you say: ""the paradigm for all social relationships (will be) the relationship of a healthy and secure mother to her child."" I contend that ""healthy and secure"" in your statement can only mean some kind of psychological prescription that is already part of the idealistic status quo. (In fact, it sounds a lot like Freud.)

That last quote also brings me to my second point about our differences. What is your concept of children? As reflected in your article (and you don't discuss it, so I can only infer from your usage of words and discussion of motherhood and Mother Right), I would say that you assume something of a children-as-property attitude toward young people. You use the phrase ""a healthy and secure mother to her child"" in the paragraph I mentioned above.

To me, this whole idea is one we have to work against, as we do the concept of the nuclear family, even with the mother as the only nucleus. I don't believe biological mothers should be the pivot point for their biological child's upbringing, and to predicate a theory for revolutionary change on that notion is, I think, a dangerous one. You also say that in your analysis, the source of your personal oppression (do you generalize this?) is: ""the enormous economic, social and psychological obstacles against bearing and raising children of (your) own."" Here again, the mother is defined as having power and control over the biological child. I know it is difficult to have kids in this society, for all the reasons that were pointed out to you by the women you met while traveling around the country. But you are not having kids because you have the power to decide not to put up with that difficulty, and for that you should only be thankful. If you aren't, then I agree with another writer that you are a victim of the glorification of motherhood myth.

Finally, I question the concept of revolution as suggested in your letter. First, it is only suggested, and aside from a couple of references to violent struggle, your strategy seems to lie in basically reformist tactics -- change (by demand) the center of the nuclear family, magically take over scientific research and practice, etc. The system will kill us before anything happens if we rely on that route. Your analogy at the end of your article to the Reformation, rather than the Chinese or Cuban revolutions, as being the process we should think of is again, I think, wrongheaded. (I don't know what you mean by the Christian revolution, and I'm not arguing that the Chinese or Cuban revolutions can give us a pattern either because they were male-dominated.) But you say that the change in consciousness predated the changes in economic and social organization, and will in our struggle too. I can only conjecture about the changes in consciousness that men went through before they smashed the gynocracies that probably existed in prehistory, but I doubt that they came first. As they got more power, they became more piggish, and on and on until the whole shit pile that exists today evolved. But I don't need conjecture to contradict you; both you and I are good examples of the ways our material conditions changed our consciousnesses. It wasn't until you began living in a culture that contained ideas about women's liberation and radical feminism that you were able to deny and contradict the lip service that you were paying to the male left even when you knew it was a sham, as you describe in the account you gave of your distrust of Sam Melville that you submerged when you wrote the introduction to the edition of his prison letters. My example is that I have been having gay relationships since I was 19, ten years ago, but I lived heterosexually in society, even got married, while I was having that constant gay experience, because everything around me reinforced the heterosexual society and the only lesbian I knew was my lover. It wasn't until I met a lot of other Dykes and saw that the lifestyle I was submerging was correct and good that I had the strength to quit the heterosexual world. And I don't think the rest of society is all that different from you and me in that sense...except that they may realize a whole lot quicker than us because of our various privileges that stand or stood in the way of our perception of our self-interest.

Love in the struggle,  
Martha, from the AIAW collective

AintIAWoman,3,5,,2,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No5_page002.txt,"Ten out of thirteen pregnancies

caught my mother's womb

at 18 tender years,

And gave her no rest until they took it away
at 39 tired ones, so she could keep working.
I lost,

Nine lives that she survives

in debt, deeper every year,

and in poor health—

make no mistake about that POOR health.

She gave up what could have been an easier life,
the single life,

for a place in Heaven, and one fucker.

That lost single-ness

and the color of her skin

could have cushioned her after a hard childhood.
But she gave up the first,

in fact, saw no choice... She says:
And in her world the second was the Rule, ""And Grandpa is old before his time.
she could eat, marry, and live in her town, He's sixty-two and it's like he's eighty. 
and be oblivious to the oppression of others. They won't let him work outside anymore.

She's never realized a lot of her own. He's at a desk....shuffling papers,

and he's miserable, he feels useless.
And he's sick—

He can't even have a beer these days.""
What can I say to that painful news?

And she prayed. Grandpa's plight catches my throat,

not out of fear for myself, but him
AND SHE'S STILL PRAYING— and my mother, who's headed that way.

to earn salvation and mercy for her kids and husband, I only mouth a defense of our class,
whom she's condemned countless times. and she doesn't give a shit what I say.
Her older daughters don't believe, really— I realize that she'll defend her life,
and her young children could defect anytime. and fight to change mine.
I keep hoping, and God knows, I'VE TRIED. And she stubbornly plugs on:
""Get a job where you go to work from 9 to 5,
I was her first,
pay your debts, and get some security for the future
and so I'm told, the most trouble. don't kid yourself, things are getting rougher.
He always told me I was the worst, Like be a clerk in a store,
and I hate him, for check-out girls at Eagle's make $3.00 an hour.""
So I tell her that carpenter's apprentices start higher,
and that men have all the job security,
even though all men don't.
My bones and bruises are healed. And I live in another town, besides.
I also won the last fight I had with him.
My mother wants me to make it,

But my sister, fourth in line, is catching the shit, now. and still keep the ethics.
And I can't really ease her pain, but I will stay working-class,
just warn her and hope she fights back sometimes, and I won't have to try.

to ward off hope:
Listen to me, mom.
I love you,
but I love myself and our people, too—
and I don't mean the Mother Church,
or racist, sexist, club-wielding men.
You like music, dancing, and slapstick comics,
I do, too.
You want your kids to eat well,
wear adequate clothing

and be clean.

I never understood class by any name,

But I can see where my consciousness came from.
I resisted staying in the Working Class

until they ripped off my last buck,

and now I'm in debt, too,

without even a year's credit,

and certainly without grace.

My sisters haven't been led on,

and will not make my mistake.

So do I.
I am a feminist and a lesbian,
so my mother and I talk about class now. When I was younger
I thought she'd die if she ever found out about
my life and my politics.
and she sometimes makes bitter comments. Well, she's found out enough to tumble the cathedral,
those goddam prayers.
If I had a nickel for every rosary...
She often berates me because she thinks I pay my debts,
with no respect for anything or anybody.
Once I wanted to change my last name
to her first name.
It only embarrassed her. She says my brains
She didn't understand, and I can't explain.
Maybe I just wanted to get back at the old man. It's hard to get things going,

like the revolution.
It's hard enough to survive
without going crazy for good.
It beats me how women without friends make it.
I tell her I want to be a carpenter, in this world.

She matters to me and my name hasn't changed.

or a printer or a mechanic— beats me where the money comes from

and all she can say is: unless it's from the top.
""You're not built for that kind of work. 
You think you're a real athlete? 
You just want a man's job, that's sick.
When you've got some talent and creativity 
you've got no business digging ditches."" 
And when I say: 
""That's bullshit, and Grandpa works at Goodyear. If he can, so can I.""
I want to."
AintIAWoman,3,5,,3,AintIAWoman/AintIaWomanVol3No5_page003.txt,"The following is an “Ain't I A Woman?” Message:

Lots of new plans and positions on where-it's-at, where-it-was, what-to-do, how-to-do-it, etc... are coming up in what some may call the women's movement. What we're all hearing is dialogue and arguments between women in our community and in other cities based on the subject matter of books and long essays. Basically, these are *Lesbian Nation* by lesbian Vi e Voice columnist and feminist Jill Johnston; *The First Sex* by Elizabeth Gould Davis and *Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory* by Jane Alpert, a former Weather affiliate and political fugitive feminist. We have been trying to get information and other women's opinions about the issues created by these books, and mostly have been pretty confused and not often satisfied. Only recently it began to dawn that all these new issues are part of an academic haze parading as the going politics and correct direction for lesbians, feminists, and separatists. We have all been arguing and searching for arguments about lesbian nation, mother right, gynarchy, and matriarchy in the name of an idea, and are failing to examine the source and its cover.

*Ain't I A Woman?* has been concerned about finding out about all these new issues so that we could sort out what should be criticized and what should be pursued. We haven't been objectively interested, either; lots of things put us off. Talk and plans of lesbian farms, goddesses, breeding out men, emphasizing culture and art, glorifying motherhood, and other such things all leave some women out in the cold, with their needs consistently ignored. Most of these women are the same women that get fucked over by the racist, male class system, consistently. We are some of those women, and that's where we're at.

We hear about lesbians being pitted against each other over the presence of a male transsexual at their conference (or somebody's conference), and for sure some women are getting fucked over there, and incorrect lines plus repressive tactics mean getting fucked over as much as a male presence does. Women called the Los Angeles conference a lot of things, including the birth of the lesbian nation, which seems presumptuous. What do conscious women expect, anyway, in the middle of a big university campus, under the close, opportunistic eye of the press and with Ronald Reagan's permission? Subversion, division, and exploitation are never accidents, and the state of California is never going to allow the birth of a revolution (which is what we need), let alone finance it and house it. Neither is Random House, Doubleday, Simon and Schuster, CBS, PBS, the Washington Post, or *Ms.* magazine.

We hear about lesbians who have enough money, property, and credit starting to buy land for rural communes and calling themselves ""nations,"" as if the fight has already been won and there is all this ""free land"" for ""free people."" How the fuck do women who are, for the most part, naive city-dwellers, dependent on urban services and the labor of other human beings, expect to handle droughts, insects, flooded fields, and all the other trials and labors of a farmer? With hired hands? Servants? How do these women, even if they learn modern methods and get all that expensive machinery, survive in the face of agribusiness and Nixon's economy? Farmers who are not big-money guys get their crops in and their animals to market with the help of other farmers and sharing equipment. And they suffer harder losses every year until they sell, against their will. There aren't going to be any bunches of lesbians next door, and primitive agriculture will not suffice. Not since the Industrial Revolution has this been possible, and not without the deaths of six billion human beings could it ever be done again, especially considering all the healing this planet needs. Short-sighted separatists determined not to relate to men would die quickly (unless supported by those of us ""sell-outs"" who have to work for a living), though true to their principles, in rural America. The grain elevators, railroads, stockyards, service co-ops, and markets are all owned and controlled by pig, capitalist men. And certainly, these women would be forced to defend ""their"" land and lifestyles against the rural people (who become the police when they are threatened) because isolating oneself totally from oppression can only be achieved by suicide.

Dear women and sisters, I never admitted how much hatred there was there (at school), never admitted my struggle as beginning class. I saw how the college perpetuated in me class values which didn't belong to me. I just wanted to write you to tell you how important *Ain't I A Woman* has been to me. When I first started subscribing, I was in a small women's college in rural New York, had never met or read a lesbian woman, and was having an incredibly difficult time accepting my own gayness though I'd been gay my whole life. Not only did *Ain't I A Woman* put me in touch with anger and sense of oppression, but more than anything else I read clear-headedness, working things out, a sense of commitment, community, joy, even love. That was important, for besides finally admitting and getting in touch with pain and anger, it gave me something to move towards - yes, some lesbians are really, really getting it together - and that gave me courage. I was so, so afraid of moving, but I began to dream of moving out and helping you write the paper, and in the meantime, I came out as the only open lesbian on campus. I faced great hostility, rejection, denial, sex objectification, and built some tenuous, mistrustful relationships with some closeted women who came to me.

I lay awake nights, amazed by what you said, scared I could never be the kind of revolutionary I knew I had to be. You gave me a handle on the revolution, a way I could grab it, grapple with it, use it. I'm in an eastern city now. It's so much nicer being with gay women that the worst struggle seems past, even though the stakes are higher. There are so many gay women here, and such security, and I hadn't realized that the reason I was more restless was that they'd already been through solidarity, that the reason I felt the gay community was because I wasn't a part of it. That's partly true; there still is a need for the solidarity, real communication, and clarity of vision I see in your paper. I'm beginning to talk to women about that, to have the courage and initiative to gather a collective to go deeper than the comfortable place we've been.

I don't mean to idealize you, but I do have profound respect for you. We hear about *The First Sex* and Jane Alpert's new theory and how women are into a return of Matriarchal Rule, goddess worship, honoring motherhood, etc. Many of us cannot relate to ancient history in very many concrete ways, maybe because it's so academic and irrelevant to our lives in the here and now. Motherhood is a frightening and complex thing to glorify. To many women, motherhood only means pain and hardship, and is something to escape, destroy, or at least de-emphasize. Motherhood as a woman's basic identification and role-to-be-respected is part of the heterosexual sexist rap we want to beat. Childcare is an issue for women, and we want to relate to it and deal with it because it is a need of women. However, in lots of cases, being allowed to do childcare, as lesbians, is another trip. Restrictions, rip-offs, and repression are being laid on us by the people who want to glorify mothers and motherhood, be they feminist or lesbian mothers, or state investigators, acting as agents of those who prefer heterosexuality, sexism, and the nuclear family.

We hear about cloning and XY chromosomes and how if women stopped having male children that men would die out in 68 years. It's been said that women have poured energy into our history and our future, but that no one is dealing with the present and the war we need to change things. It would take much longer than 68 years to get women to stop producing male children, unless dykes are talking about taking control of people's lives to institute such a fucked-up priority dream. No men suits us fine, but for a white, middle-class-dominated movement to talk so glibly about exterminating all men is genocidal, because most men and most women are not white and are disenfranchised and oppressed by the ruling classes and governments that were the first to think of killing off undesirables, anyway, including lesbians. We know that women of color who are feminists, lesbians, and separatists are man-haters. We know that poor and working-class white feminists, lesbians, and separatists are man-haters, because we are some of those women. It is not outrageous to hear Third World women condemn the power and pigshit of men of their races. Those women are under those men in this society; white middle-class women are not. The rage of those of us who are working-class against men is real; it is our right. It's painful and infuriating to think of those well-fed women taking pride in beating or murdering, at random, men whose bodies are possibly sick, tired, and weak from being overworked and undernourished. This is not to say that women should not begin making immediate, violent retaliations against male institutions and male attackers, in whatever way we see fit. And it is not to say that we should not kill men if that is what it takes to blast away this shit pile once and for all.

I'm thinking that many women are going to attack or dismiss what is said here as male left ad nauseum, etc., that being such an effective threat against feminists; but I'll wager that most women with their shit together, especially about class or race, will understand exactly what is being talked about. If all this pre-revolutionary energy for genocide were refocused on trying to start the fights that will lead to being able to eat, live, and have the right of self-determination (important idea, there), life'd be bearable. But maybe this energy isn't really energy, but more haze and distraction. It's increasingly obvious that even in the women's movement, even in radical lesbian groups, that poor and Third World women are invisible; we do not exist to the Amazons, artists, Matriarchists, and media-pushers. Women do not have to read *Lesbian Nation* or *The First Sex* to ""know where it's at in the women's movement,"" and should not have to hear any woman tell us we do. Academic and literary world women should not push culture, art, and their intelligentsia standards down our throats. These things are not a part of most women's lives and struggles. Lesbians should not palm off the heterosexual ""mother right"" on other lesbians, mothers, and non-mothers alike.

Coming up with a realistic analysis of things starts with recognizing who we are and what our needs are. All of us, and all of our real needs. Being ""uncultured,"" ""uneducated,"" and isolated from hip trips is not the pitiful life. Being hungry and dependent and sick in our bodies from being denied even minimal unoppressive medical care is the lot of most women and most lesbians and most female children, and these needs should be paramount to revolution-minded dykes. Let's stop eating up media traps and tempting professional interests. Let's find real meat to sink our teeth into, literally.

I respect that you write about your community of women and yourselves, and detail that struggle, because I believe that is the level where politics, action, and revolution are made. I respect you for putting revolution in such a concrete form that I can really grapple with it. I respect you for not compromising what you say. I disagree with people who don't think your paper speaks to those new to feminism. I came to your paper as politically naive as any, and as scared, confused, and self-hating as any, and I saw the clarity of it, and it may have kept me awake nights, but thank god for that. With me at least your paper succeeds in that it helps me clarify directions and goals and stirs me to action. It shakes me up.

I've wanted to write to you a long time, but felt inadequate, inarticulate. Doing tae kwon do has helped me put my anger into good solid fighting and somehow that has helped the words flow. I think I would like to have a relationship with you, writing to and for you as my writing gets better if you want. You can do with this letter what's useful to you, publish it if you want.

I'd like your complete volumes #1 & 2. I've had some of those copies I think, but I keep giving them away to women sitting next to me on buses and so on...

Best of my hopes for you. With deep felt thanks and love,

On June 24 a New Orleans gay bar  
burned up, killing at least one woman  
and 28 men. Most survivors were in-  
jured. Ironically, this happened  
while many gay people in other cities  
celebrated Gay Pride Week.  

We feel the need to report this  

for two reasons: one, the mass media  
didn't always say it was a gay bar;  
two, it's a horrible manifestation of  
exploitative unconcern by gay bar own-  
ers. That bar was burned out in 18

INTO HISTORY

we DO have a history!

If the silence of the
historians is taken
to mean anything,

it would appear that
one-half of our po-
pulation have been
negligible factors

in our country's his-
tory. (Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Sr. New
Viewpoints in Ameri-
can History, 1922)

Fifty years ago an eminent
male historian called at-
tention to the gross neglect
of women in the standard
interpretations of American
history. It didn't do much
good, did it? How many of us
in the countless history
courses that we were fed in
public school or even college,
ever encountered a woman who
was important? If the authors
of textbooks felt compelled
to mention women, they
brought in two or three appa-
rent oddballs--Carrie Nation,
the temperance worker who
chopped down bars was a favo-
rite--leaving us with the
impression that real, normal
women have never been an in-
tegral part of American history.
This will be a regular
column that will discuss the
history of women in America,
as one way to begin to under-
mine the myth that only men
have had a history. The co-
lumn will take a variety of

forms--short biographies of
interesting women, book re-
views and discussions of the
conditions of women in the
past. Out of this we can
begin to know a little more
about our history.

The column might also
lead us to other questions.
Just what does the history
of women in America involve?
Does it mean rewriting male
WASP history to include

female superstars?

Or perhaps female history
should begin at the opposite
end with an examination of the
history of the family, that
intimate institution in which
most ordinary women have lived
out their lives. But who
was the “ordinary woman""? Was
there ever such a person? Was
she the middle-class leisured
lady or the farm girl hired
to work in the textile mill?
Was she the Southern planta-
tion wife or her house slave?
What were the differences
among American women that
created the variations in the
experience of growing up female
in America? And beyond these
differences, was there a common
experience out of which a
feminist consciousness could
have developed? Did we develop
a female culture alongside
the dominant male culture?
Despite the neglect of wo-
men in the history texts,

there are many isolated books
with which we can begin the
task of putting ourselves back
into history. I will mention
a couple of these each issue.
To begin with, if you want to
get a general, overall picture
of the history of American
women, there are a couple of
good paperbacks out that
should be available at either
Together Books or RIP Bookstore.
Andrew Sinclair's The Emancipa-
tion of the American Woman

(also available in hardback at the
library under the title The
Better Half) is a very readable
history that does a fair job
of dealing with more than just
superwomen and the women's
movement. The Woman in American
History (190 pp.) by Gerda
Lerner is shorter and was writ-
ten as a high school text.
However, it probably gives the
best short, overall picture
presently available.

I hope that this column will
reflect your interests as well
as mine. Please write and let
me know what you would like
me to write about as well as
your reactions to what I've
written. Susan Spragg Jones,

MOVIE REVIEW

Stand Up & Be Counted

The story line is stereo-
typically simple. Three main
characters--one a super-career
woman, one a hassled housewife,
and one a sex symbol married to
a business tycoon make up the
characters. Each, in her own
way, works out her personhood.

I won't dull the movie for you
by going into detail.

I do have strong positive and
negative feelings. One good
thing is that it is clearly
stated that there is no individ-
ual liberation. All women are
in the struggle together. The
movie showed women as strong,
sensitive people, capable of
changing their lives.

The ""bad"" are along the lines
of political criticism. The movie
didn't deal at all with the problems
of consumer capitalism. The women
in the movie are dressed like fa-
shion models, with full make-up and,
one assumes, vaginal deodorant.

The movie implies that, if a woman
wants to be liberated, she can go
out and get a tremendously satis-
fying job making tons of money. (Fat
chance) One of the sub-plots ques-
tions the right of a factory owner
to pay women less than men; it
never questions his right to own

the factory. Etc., etc., etc.

There are moments in the movie
that really embarrassed me with its
clumsiness. The ""consciousness-
raising group scene"" was clearly
made by someone never remotely con-

nected with consciousness-raising.

The movie briefly mentions les-
bians, poor women, older women, etc.,
but one shot on each subject is
hardly “in depth.""

The way Senior Women's Liberation
was handled was degrading. It was
pretty clearly a man's view of older
women.

I think this review is a lot
more negative than is necessary.

For all its faults, I think you
will leave feeling excited and happy.

Even knowing that I was being
co-opted, I loved seeing women be-
ing ""together.""

reprinted in a newsletter sent to

~~ the wives of interns and residents
in Denver. It's just another ex-
ample of the subtle mystification
of social roles.

The thing that makes a physi-
cian a very special person is his
decision to dedicate himself to
the practice of medicine. Except
for this universal dedication
every doctor is different, just
as every man is different. It is
your adjustment to the individual
doctor who is your husband and
the life you must lead because of
his dedication that will determine
what kind of a doctor's wife you
will be.

A former president of the AMA
has said: ""Nothing is as impor-
tant in shaping a doctor's career
as is his wife and home. The doc-
tor's wife must share his ideal-
ism, appreciate a standard of
values held by no other group and
give him an understanding re-
quired by few. Being a doctor's
wife is both a career and an art.""

In any career or art there are
techniques to be mastered. So it
is with the career of being a doc-
tor's wife. Of the necessary
techniques or qualities, I would
first list unselfishness. You
must learn to be unselfish with

“What is a Doctor? —

(What is a Doctor’s Wife?)

your husband because whether you
like it or not, he belongs first
to his profession. In your in-
nocence when you married him you
probably thought the phrase in
the ceremony ""In sickness and in
health"" meant just you two. You
were wrong for with a physician
it really means the sickness and
health of the whole community.
You must unselfishly share him
with his patients, with medical
meetings and all the other things
that are required of him if he is
to be a good doctor. The very
nature of his profession makes him
public property.

You will understand the need
for patience with your children.
They will not have the insight a-
bout their Dad's preoccupation
with his profession. Your atti-
tude can be most important in
teaching your children to respect
their father's dedication. Your
teaching can make your children
know that their dad does ""good""
for others and because of this he
cannot always be there when his
children want him.

A third quality is self-reli-
ance. You must learn to make de-
cisions yourself--decisions that
other women call upon their hus-
bands to make. You will have to
make decisions about your home,
your children, your attitude to-
ward life; you must lead the home-
front.

These then are some of the
qualifications of a good doctor's
wife--she is unselfish, patient,
self-reliant. A good marriage to
a doctor is partnership. It is
something that both of you will
slave to work at to attain. It
doesn't just happen. The wife
has more than an equal share of
the responsibility to see that
the partnership is a good one. I
am reminded of a passage from
Kahlil Gibran's book, ""The
Prophet"" from the part in which
he speaks of marriage. He says:

You shall be together, But

let there be spaces in

your togetherness

Love one another, but make

not a bond of love;

Fill each other's cup, but

drink not from one cup

Give one another of your

bread, but eat not from

the same loaf;

Sing and dance together

and be joyous, but let

each of you be alone

Though they quiver with
the same music, the
strings of the lute are
alone.

And stand together yet not
too near, For the pillars
of the temple stand apart

And the oak and the cy-
press grow not in each
other's shadow. . .""

Mrs. B.L. Robertson

He might have had the doctor
and his wife in mind when he wrote
those beautiful lines. As a
doctor's wife your first responsi-
bility is to your husband, your

family, your home. You may some-
times rebel against making so
many decisions on your own, a-
gainst so much disciplining of
your emotions but the reward will
be great. What more could you
ask than a contented husband and
happy children?

Fee"
BigMammaRag,1,1,,6,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page006.txt,". . . AND HERE’S TO YOU, MRS. ROBERTSON

:

My first response to Mrs.  
Robertson's article is anger  
mixed with a little sadness, too,  
that another woman would write  
such a sugar-coated, dogmatic,  
sentimentalized, and destructive  
guide to how other women should  
define their existence.

I am a doctor's wife. I do not  
consider it a ""career"" to be  
one. It is a relationship that  
I have with another person who  
happens to be a doctor. As a  
separate individual with my own  
needs, (to grow, to be dedicated,  
to contribute to the community),  
I resent anyone telling me to de-  
fine myself in terms of another  
person and his needs. Mrs.  
Robertson says that I must ""make  
an adjustment"" to my husband and  
the life he has chosen, and that  
that ""adjustment"" will determine  
the kind of life I will lead.

No, thank you, Mrs. Robertson.  
I have my own needs, my own life  
to choose and to create; my life  

is not a series of adjustments in  
my husband's direction. Rather I  
see our life, ideally, as an e-  
qual experience of sharing—of  
giving and taking, and part of  
that sharing is the protesting to-  
gether the medical system that  
denies my being a person in my  
own right and denies my husband  
the same thing.

The medical power structure  
has set it up so that a doctor is  
considered “public property.”

The conflict that the individual  
doctor feels between his public  
life and his private needs stems  
from the irresponsible attitude  
of the medical profession which  
maintains a shortage of doctors  
and a hierarchical structure of  
roles within the medical system  
in its own interest. By mini-  
mizing its responsibility to the  
community, the medical profes-  
sion puts the responsibility on  
the individual doctor who feels  
isolated in this conflict and  
powerless to resolve it. This  
idea that a doctor is public prop-  
erty is part of the mystification  
of what a doctor is—that doesn't  
allow him feelings in dealing  
with his profession, or the choice  
of making his private life as im-  
portant to him as his public life,  
or allow him to make a mistake,  

to admit uncertainty, to deal in  
a human way with the human beings  
he is serving.

Mrs. Robertson, you give me  
three ""qualifications for being  
a good doctor's wife."" Unself-  
ishness is the first one. Like  
most women, I have been raised  
to be unselfish—to put others'  
needs before my own. I have  
found that it is not a virtue to  
be unselfish at all times, es-  
pecially around this issue of  
being a doctor's wife. It is this  
""unselfishness"" that separates  
women who are doctor's wives and  

keeps them from openly sharing  
the pain they experience because  
they and their husbands have been  
indoctrinated into thinking, as  
you say, that “whether you like  
it or not, he belongs first to  
his profession."" No. He belongs  
first to himself and he can de-  
termine the priorities in his own  
life. By accepting this defini-  

tion of medicine being a doctor's  
entire life, we cannot trust our  
own feelings and protest when our  
husbands, as interns and resi-  
dents, are forced to work 100 out  
of 168 hours in a week—when we  
see them exhausted physically and  
emotionally by the pressures of  
work—or when they have invested  
so much time and energy into their  
work that they lose interest in  
other people or even in question-  
ing the very system which is de-  
humanizing them. Perhaps this is  
why so many doctors are seen as  
cold, uncaring, unable to deal  
with their own faults and feel-  
ings. It must be hell to be ex-  
pected to be perfect, dedicated,  
to play God, when you know in-  
side that you are only a human  
being like everyone else.

I want to join with other  
people (doctor's wives, doctors,  
students, other health profession-  
als, etc.) in demanding that a  
doctor's training be a human ex-  
perience—that he and I be given  
time and space to grow in the  
directions we choose for our-  
selves, and have the right to de-  
fine for ourselves what is im-  
portant in our lives at any given  
time. 

Mrs. Robertson, you say I must  
also be ""patient"" to qualify as  
a ""good"" doctor's wife. I am  
patient with my children; I am  
also aware of my impatience with  
them, an impatience which stems  
from knowing that I carry most of  
the responsibility for raising  
them. But I will not lie to them.  
I will not tell them that it is  
my husband's ""dedication to do  
good"" for others which keeps him  
away from them, when I know he  
would rather be sharing his life  
more fully with them—knowing  
them as I know them. I will  
teach them to be impatient with  
the system that makes too many  
demands on their father's time  
and energy. That denies him his  
own needs as a human being. The  
justification for overworking  
doctors is that there is a short-  
age of doctors. True, there is  

a shortage of doctors, but it is  
the medical power hierarchy which  
maintains and encourages that  
shortage in its own interests.

I will also teach my children  
that.

Third, Mrs. Robertson, you say  
that I must be self-reliant.

Part of the strength of being  
self-reliant is knowing what your  
limits are, where your resent-  
ments begin, and what you need as  
a person. I will not ""discipline  
my emotions"" as you suggest, ac-  
cepting without question the role  
of a doctor's wife. I will trust  
my emotions as good indicators of  
what is wrong with the expecta-  
tions that are being made of me.  
Any rebelling against these ex-  
pectations and the system that  
created them, I consider a sign  
of mental health.

I would like to rewrite your  
last paragraph: As a person in  
my own right, my first responsi-  
bility is to myself—to under-  
standing and dealing with my own  
needs and feelings. Only after  
that can I deal honestly with  

anyone else. I will rebel a-  
gainst the structure of the medi-  
cal profession which denies both  
my husband and myself the possi-  
bility of defining ourselves and  
creating our own lives. I see  
my role as a doctor's wife in  
supporting and getting support  
from my husband against that sys-  
tem. What more could I ask than  
to be my own person first, and to  
share that with the people  
closest to me?"

I had a dream last month  
that I'd like to share with you.  
I dreamed I had finally left  
my husband; I passed through  
the door of his house and stood  
outside, where the sun shone on  
the green hills and valleys  
of the world. As I was looking  
around, wondering which house  
I would live in next, I slowly  
formed a question that had  
never been asked before.

""Why do I always have to live  
in some man's house?"" Be-  
cause it suddenly occurred to  
me that women, too, could  
build houses: all they had to  
do was to realize that they  
could.

It wasn't too many years  
ago that women had to depend  
on men for all the necessi-  
ties of life. A woman, single  
or married, generally lived  
with her father, husband, son  
or some other male relative  
or employer. This isn't  
true anymore, of course, women  
can earn their own bread and  
live alone if they please,  
although we are slow to realize  
that this can be a serious  
lifetime choice.

But few people want to live  
alone, and here's where we are  
almost as dependent as ever.  
Women are still forced into the  
feminine role, not by number  
but by loneliness. For the  
one officially sanctioned source  
of closeness for women is  
marriage. Yet marriage (and  
most other couple relation-  
ships) separate us. In exchange  
for intimacy with one man, we  
separate ourselves from every  
one else--by centering our  
lives within single-family  
houses, by taking sole respon-  
sibility for our children,  
by treating other women as  
threats to this one intimacy.  
Men join force with each  
other every day, but for women  
--well, ""divide and conquer""  
really works.

My dream was firmly  
rooted in my waking life,  
because I did leave my  
husband last fall, and I have  
indeed been trying to move  
out of my man-centered  
thinking and find my  
own way of living in the  
world. I've been in a  
good place for changing and  
growing, because I've been  
living in a community (Insti-  
tute Mountain West) which  
is not male dominated, and  
which provides much of the  
closeness I need without  
requiring the emotional  
tradeoffs that usually ac-  
company couple relationships.  
As a result, I now take  
communal living very seriously  
as a base for people learning  
to exercise their own  
strength. And particularly  
for women, who have been  
separated for so long and  
are now finding their  
strength through solidarity  
with each other.

For me, the difficulties  
in building a house for my-  
self have been psychic; fears  
(would our families and  
friends reject me?), uncer-  
tainties (could I really  
take care of myself?), guilt  
trips (what would this do  
to the children?). For many  
women, there are also practi-  
cal difficulties--full-time  
child care, no place to live,  
no money, no job skills.  
These problems can be para-  
lyzing for a woman alone.  
They can be overcome by women  
together.

So: a proposal. I would  
like to see a communal house  
in Denver for women only, a  
house whose main purpose is  
giving support to women who  
are trying to restructure their  
lives. Practical support;  

a place to live cheaply by  
sharing space and possessions,  
maybe temporarily free by  
sharing income. The opportu-  
nity to cooperate with sisters  
in child care. Maybe job  
sharing, or a job coop for  
part-time work. And psychic  
support; living with sisters in  
a community that encourages  
openness. Sharing our strug-  
gles, one to one or in groups,  
with other people who know  
what we're talking about.

Knowing that we aren't alone.

I see this house as a base from  
which women would have the  
chance to explore new living  
possibilities, and to feel their  
strength as women and  
with women. It would seem  
natural for this house to have  
shared child care for the resi-  
dents; it might also serve as  

a permanent home for a coop  
nursery school. Perhaps  

space for a women's center, a  
library or clinic?

There is some money avai-  
lable for this project; it  
should be possible to make a  
down payment on a building  
and, instead of pouring rent  
into a capitalistic landlord's  
pocket; liberate it in the form  
of a land trust permanently  
owned by the women who occupy  
it.

A lot of people have ex-  
pressed interest and support  
for this idea. What is needed  
right now is a few women who  
share my commitment to com-  
munal living, who would con-  
sider actually living in the  
house for several months and  
putting at least part-time  
time and energy into it. If  
that sounds like you, I'd like  
to hear from you. I can be  
reached at the Institute, 2096  
Emerson Street, or phone  
573-6394.

I see the article in Women,  
Vol. 2, No. 4, on the Philadel-  
phia Women's Transition House  
for a more detailed discussion  
of this idea.

I want to write a journal about  
myself as a woman and as a mother,  
to explore my thoughts in a deeper  
and more coherent way. I also want  
to share my own struggle because if  
I had been able to read something  
like this, I would never have felt  
so isolated and full of self-hate  
and doubts.

I think being pregnant and giving  
birth and then motherhood are  
very different experiences. For  
example, before finding out I was  
pregnant, I fantasized about being  
pregnant and giving birth and nursing.  
I didn't think about what it would  
mean on a day-to-day basis. Mo-  
therhood was so undifferentiated  

and idealized as a glorified state  
of being, as something I magically  
became; it got very confusing as I  
struggled to define how the ideal  
fit into my daily experiences.

After my second wedding anni-  
versary, I found out I was preg-  
nant. A diaphragm baby—a dia-  
phragm used carelessly because,  
well, I believe I wanted to have a  
baby. We more or less planned to  
get pregnant in a year or two's  
time.

As soon as I left the clinic,  

waiting for David to pick me up and—  

to tell him, I cried. I felt  
cheated because I had always looked  
forward to deciding consciously to  
get pregnant. I felt like a fail-  
ure because I saw myself as some-  
one who had control over such mat-  
ter-of-fact processes as birth con-  
trol. I also realized that David  
and I would no longer be totally in-  
dependent and without responsibili-  
ties. One reason for putting off  
getting pregnant was that I wanted  
more time alone with David.

It was really a matter of timing.  
On one hand, David and I figured  
there was never a perfect time.  
There was always something else to  
do—travel, education, work. On the  
other hand, ""if not now, when?""

I always thought I would get  
pregnant after I got my career to-  
gether. We had fantasies of each  
of us getting half-time jobs while  
we had babies so we could share in  
their care, and taking turns working  
once the children (notice the plu-  
ral form) were older. Well, there  
I was, a first-year graduate student  
in Sociology at Berkeley, and I knew  
that I was not going to be a profes-  
sor one day. I was not going to

in six parts. This is Part One.

woman and a mother.

While in Berkeley, California, one of the women working on BIG MAMA met the woman  
who wrote the following journal, and brought it back to Denver for other women to  

It is a very long, thoughtful journal relating the concrete experiences of  

have one of those careers or be a  
traditional academic woman. Yet no  
alternate lifestyles appealed to  
me—regular movement politics or  
hippy hang loose. I wanted to do  
some meaningful work, but was con-  
fused about what kind of work to  
get into.

So there I was, dissatisfied with  
my work and vaguely figuring I  
could get some kind of fulfillment  
out of parenthood.

Now, two years later, obviously  
due a large part to being a mother  
of a 17-month-old girl, I see a  
career, travel, and education dif-  
ferently. My career will be inti-  
mately involved with the women's  
movement; I am more into internal  
journeys than travel to other lands,  
and I see my formal education in a  
much more utilitarian fashion—I  
use it to get a job (I am a teach-  
ing assistant), and will use a pro-  
gram to be trained in a skill if  
it is expedient.

But I am getting ahead of myself.  
I hadn't considered much about ac-  
tual motherhood—the caretaking and  
responsibility for a child or in-  
fant. Pregnancy and birth were the  
center of my fantasies as I thought  
about and decided to remain preg-  
nant.

I think at this point more de-  
tails of my personal biography are  
relevant. This was February 1969.

I had heard about women's libera-  
tion and welcomed it wholeheartedly  
as very relevant to my life. When  
I married, I thought I legally had to  
change my name. I did, and hated  
being Mrs. Him. When I arrived in  
Berkeley, I changed back to my mai-  
den name. I realize it is my fa-  
ther's name, but it was me for 22  
years and I never felt like I was  
Mrs. David Him.

I went through bureaucratic and  
emotional hassles doing that change.  
I felt like a lonely fanatic.  
""What's in a name?"" is the message  
I got from my circle of leftish  
male graduate students. From David  
I got passive support. From the  
straight world at the University I  
got expressions of unbelief and  
hostility. From women friends I got  
tacit support, but many wondered if  
it was worth the hassle. But I had  
to do it for my state of mind. I  
did it in some slightly devious ways  
because I didn't have the energy or  
support for honest confrontations.

That Fall, I sought out a women's  
liberation small group. I went to  
two different ones. One had been  
going on and I felt I needed to be  
in one from the beginning. The next  
was composed of women connected to  
Berkeley male political heavies. It  
was very in-groupy and I felt left  
out. So I didn't go back. But I  
read available literature and saw  
my marriage as being liberated. I  
saw it like that for a couple of  
reasons. I no longer was Mrs. Him,  
and I shared the household tasks  
with my husband. I was unaware  
that I still felt and acted on the  
total responsibility for that work.  
In the Fall of 1968, I believed I  
had an equalitarian marriage, that  
when we had a child we would con-  
tinue being equal in child care.

So when I found out I was preg-  
nant, I used to say ""we"" are preg-  
nant. We planned to share the ex-  
perience in as total a way as we  
knew how.

I got into being pregnant. I  
had always looked forward to that  
time as one of joy and beauty. I  
didn't feel I was creating a being  
really. I used to tell people, ""It  
is creating itself."" I dug the  
changes in my body; it was a groovy  
physical experience. I read books  
about the natural process of preg-  
nancy. I found another woman who  
was pregnant and we shared experi-  
ences, pains and aches, doctor stor-  
ies and information on natural"
BigMammaRag,1,1,,10,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page010.txt,"childbirth. I loved to watch the  
changes in my body and to fantasize  
about the growth of a human being  
going on right inside me. I felt  
for the first time in years that my  
body really looked beautiful, and I  
got positive feedback about that  
from friends. It was a happy and  
exciting time for David and me.  
When I look back I can see some  
things I was blind to. What I  
thought was sharing being pregnant  
wasn't really sharing at all.  
While the baby was going to be ours  
in a real way, I was the one who  
desperately needed another woman to  
talk to. I was the one avidly read-  
ing pregnancy books. David read  
sections I suggested in various  
books, but he didn't feel the ab-  
sence of an expectant father to  
share with. When you get down to  
it, I, not we, was biologically  
pregnant. When the Third World and  
People's Park crises came, I stayed  
home to protect the unformed child  
inside me and David did battle in  
the streets.  

When I was seven months pregnant  
we moved into a house in Oakland  
with another couple and a single  
woman. We wanted to live communal-  
ly and literally took the plunge—  
barely knowing the other people.  
But dare to struggle, dare to win,  
and after all, we could always  
split if things didn't work out.  

About two weeks before the due  
date we waited in a time feeling  
that is very definitely one belong-  
ing to pregnancy—a feeling of days  
being epochs—a time feeling Doris  
Lessing captures so well in A Prop-  
er Marriage. At last labor began.  
It was slow and long. I spent a  
day at home and we kept saying, ""Is  
it really happening now?""  

I was well trained in the pro-  
cess of natural or prepared child-  
birth, and David and I made a very  
good team of breather and coach/ti-  
mer. He was really there for me,  
helping me keep in control of the  
wave of each contraction. We are  
both excellent students and had  
learned our lessons well.  

The whole birth experience was  
one of joy and pain. It was a  
physical and emotional high unlike  
any I had ever experienced. ""Pain  
and pushing and feeling relieved,""  
I wrote in my journal. David got  
tears in his eyes when I was final-  
ly dilated and started to push; I  
was totally involved in the physi-  
cal process with no energy to re-  
flect. How rare for me not to al-  
ways be watching and analyzing with  
my inner eye. David and I felt we  
were sharing a unique and loving  
moment.  

For many reasons the hospital  
stay was a downer. Mainly because  
immediately after the birth, I was  
separated from David. Once I knew  
Amanda was a girl who was perfectly  
formed physically, my main desires  
were to be with David and share our  
news with family and friends. But  
I was left alone in a crowded hos-  
pital. The nurses were hassled  
and bothered. I saw David three  
hours in total during the two days  
before I finally got rooming-in.  
After great protest and maneuvering  
I was put into rooming-in with  
three other women. Rooming-in  
means the babies and fathers are  
with you all day. My one night  
there I felt isolated from the oth-  
er women. They said things I  
couldn't identify with, which  
freaked me, like ""I was my hus-  
band's bride, now I'm his son's  
mother."" Discussions about endless  
shopping for the perfect crib and  
clothes went on. They told how  
being pregnant was their secret and  
how each decided the right moment  
to let her husband in on it. They  
each told their stories not really  
listening to the other women,  
waiting for the polite moment to  
relate their trip. I had enough  
consciousness then not to blame or  
put down those women. What this  
experience was for me, I wasn't  
sure; I was clearer about what it  
was not.

BigMammaRag,1,1,,11,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page011.txt,"LESBIAN 0010 YOU ?

I said I would write an article
about ""Gay Women"" for Big Mama and
since I happen to be one, (a Gay
Woman that is) I guess that's ap-
propriate. What does the word
Lesbian do to you? I know what it
used to do to me. It would bring
to mind imagery and words such as:
women in men's suits, perversion,
butch, insecurity and a threaten-
ing feeling. It still means that
for many people. Actually, the
word Lesbian has a long history.
The word stems from an old myth
about a group of very fierce Amazon
women who saw nothing wrong with
loving one another and developed
strong primary groups without men.
Their culture glorified women
loving women. These women lived
on the isle of Lesbos and from
there we get the derivative
""Lesbian.""

Now to get to the concept of
Lesbian as it is for me and as
other people see me as a Lesbian.
A good many of the straight women
I know who used to be warm and
friendly have become cool and a-
loof, and as uninvolved as possible
now that they know I'm gay. I
think that I might raise some
doubts in their minds about their
life-styles and relationships with

men. I, also at some point, have
felt bisexuality intellectually to
be the ideal way for people to
exist, but on the reality level, I
feel that it's about as realistic
as asking for Utopia in Hell. I
also feel that sexuality labels
are degrading and limiting, but
are very necessary for the ways in
which people relate to each other
at this point. I personally can't
stand labels: heterosexual, bi-
sexual, homosexual. It shouldn't
make a difference but unfortunately
it does, and that's the situation
we're forced to deal with.

Men who see me as a Lesbian see
me as a challenge. Liberal men
want to get down to my basic human
spirit, and want me to prove to
them that I'm not really a castrat-
ing bitch. They're perfectly will-
ing to give me the chance. Fuck
it, if you'll pardon the expres-
sion, I'm tired of explaining my-
self to men. I'm tired of apolo-
gizing for feelings of anger, rage,
pain and hatred, that were placed
in me by men. I'm tired of ex-
plaining the dehumanizing destruc-
tion of my soul, my inner being,
me, to men who exclaim, ""Well,
Honey, that wasn't me, that was
some other male chauvinist pig,""

or, ""It's not me, it's the power
structure. I'm just a working
class pawn...true, I'm more privi-
leged than you, but honest I don't
have a God-Damned thing to do with
the mess women are in."" The same
men will turn around and mess me
over on perhaps just a higher in-
tellectual level than the rest of
the Male Chauvinist Pigs. I've
finally decided that I have to
focus my anger on the people who
deserve it or destroy myself. The
battle is not over yet, and, by
God, I intend to win.

I enjoy determining who I am,
what I want, and I enjoy having
support from Lesbian sisters who
understand where I'm coming from,
recognize the enemy, and no longer
have to spout lies and make ex-
cuses for men. I enjoy loving and
being loved by women spiritually
and physically. I'm beginning to
think that Lesbians are the only
non-masochistic women in our so-
ciety. How can you conquer an op-
pressor when you sleep with him
every night? Yes, I did say con-
quer, the only way women are going
to obtain liberty is to take it.
As long as we relate to men and
they maintain positions of relative
power, we will continue to enforce
their positions in the status quo.
No oppressor readily relinquishes

power to pleading, and attempts at
education. It takes riots and
mass uprisings and strikes to hit
where it hurts, right in the balls
of male ruling class status quo
Capitalism. Every white man in
this country benefits from it, and

PARK HILL WOMEN'S CENTER

Talked to a friend of mine
the other day. She told me I
should go check out EVERYWOMAN,
a women's center in Park Hill.
So off I trucked, finding myself
(once I got there) in the midst
of a morning tea, with crafts
being sold to raise money for
the center. Most of the women
at the center seemed to be
young mothers. The child-care
center took care of the little
ones. EVERYWOMAN seems to
be a women's center with great
possibilities. For more infor-
mation, call 377-0847. The
address: 2390 Birch.

AS

Perhaps putting an article
in this paper seems like a
strange way to say goodbye
to two of the people you have
lived with for over a year.
In one sense it's the only
way I can share the unique
love I have for two people so
much younger than I, and yet
from a very selfish perspec-
tive, it's really the only way
I can share it with them. For

I am sure that when the real-

ity of their leaving has

packed the last suitcase in

the trunk, and the pillows

and blankets in the back seat
have arranged themselves around
the toys, and the busy work

is over and awkward hands fum-
ble for something to do—

when all the ""drive safely's""

and ""write soon's"" have been
said 3 times... that when

it really comes time, a hug
that's a little too hard

and a kiss that's a little

too long, will have to suffice

for the words that suddenly
become nothing but tears.

To those of you who
question the effect of col-
lective living on children,

I ask you to instead

marvel at the possible effect
of children on a collective
of ""grown-ups."" To those

of you who imagine that all
radical collective conversa-
tions revolve around home-made
bém ingredients and lurid
sexual activity, I ask you

to consider the effect of
Tommy riding horsey on your
leg during a meeting, or
Rainey's request for the

house to buy more bananas.

To those of you who be-
lieve that all young radicals
relate impersonally to a
Revolution that would destroy
all that you deem sacred, I
ask you to take into consi-

deration the sleepless nights

we have all spent measu-

ring the ways we unconscious-

ly manipulate children, and
the early-morning house

meetings that have talked

themselves far into the late
afternoon about still un-
answered questions. And they
are good questions to be
asked and I hope we keep on
asking and trying.

Tommy and Rainey—I hope
you understand this pen-to-
paper cop out.

It'll be much easier for
me to have you read the good
things I feel for you, than
to look you in the eye and say
them, knowing that, given the
chance, I would probably
hurt you many times. And
once again I take the chance
of laying a trip on you.

Oo Miny vid

Maybe you'll think this is
all pretty silly and that

all I had to do was come and
tell you I really like you,
and maybe spend the afternoon
in the park. And you're
probably right—if that's
what you're thinking—but...

I guess I'd like you both
to know that the night we
spent reading the ""Little
Prince,"" wrapped in a sleeping
bag on my balcony, or the
time in the middle of summer
we pretended a snowstorm had
hit and put on our winter
coats and went to the park
to battle the winds, and the
night we celebrated the
completion of my loft with
a “loft party,"" or even
the night we tried to fake
one of our singing, guitar,
harmonica parties with instant
hot chocolate and Tommy refu-
sed to drink it 'cause it tasted
like warm water—that those
times were as fun and impor-
tant to me as the good times
I had when I went out and
you couldn't, or when I
stayed up and you had to go
to bed.—And that having
chocolate marshmallow
cookie crumbs in my bed
was really not as frustrating
as I made it out to be.

Aside from all the times
we obviously enjoyed each
other, there were many mo-
ments when I silently
comforted myself in your
friendship. Thinking at
times that you two alone
allowed me the total free-
dom I needed to find and
enjoy the lost pleasures of
my being. I never told you
that of course, first be-
cause at the time it
seemed unnecessary to put it
into words, and secondly
because I guess it seemed
ridiculous for a 25-year-
old woman to tell two ""kids""

7 and 9, that she appreciated
and needed them.

It seemed ridiculous then,
but through you two and the
times we've spent together

I'm beginning—just begin-
ning—to understand and
learn exactly what it means
to be a child in a society
where you are made into a
separate class of people.

A class where adults pro-
ject their myths and define
your childhood, where your
privileges are handed out
and taken away by those

who maintain control over
you (much like the Rich

vs. the Poor), where you are
told, perhaps often, that
being loved requires a
certain behaviour also dic-
tated to you by adults.

But amidst the confusion
I have seen your strength and
I envy and admire it. And so—
to you Rainey, whose earned
sarcasm and intelligence
will not allow me to project
my ego on the myth of your
childhood—I hope to devote
a good portion of my conscious-
ness to your ideas of libera-
tion.

And to you Tommy, whose
bluntness will never cease
to ring truth in my heart, I
lend an unbending ear to
the creative mechanics
that puts cardboard wheels
on beer cans and is capable
of fantastically complex
a.m. art work over a bowl of
Frankenberry cereal.

It's a new field of love
for me and it's sort of
frightening. If I get a little
lost in my exploration I'd
appreciate a helping hand.
And hopefully there will be
times when our understandings
will be so close that we may
just spend the whole after-
noon in each other's laps.
Thank you, Tommy and Rainey,
for not allowing me to con-
trol you and for giving me
a chance to love you—your
way. It's much freer than
anything I have to offer."

PRESS ROOM

I asked myself why I was so enraged, and so profoundly embarrassed, by the photographs of the interior of the press room at the County Courthouse. I have seen pictures of nude women before, in what I consider to be degrading and humiliating poses. And I am

certainly no longer surprised to find instances of sexism in every aspect of our society. Why, then, does this example of overt male chauvinism affect me more deeply than some others? I think it is because of the specific circumstances—first, because it was in the county courthouse, a place where both men and women work all day, go in and out, etc. What does a woman feel who has to work in such an atmosphere? Secondly, these degrading photographs were in the press room, a place where people intimately involved with the media and news coverage work. It makes me cringe to think of what these men think of me, as a woman, and then to expand that to think of what the attitude of this country's media network is toward women in general. The same men who put up those pictures are the men who have, at their fingertips, access to the news media that can sway public opinion to a great degree. The tone and/or bias of their reporting can help to make or break the women's movement.

I ask myself why feminism is

‘Press,’

Carof

always distorted by the media, why half-nude women are on T.V. selling shaving cream or toothpaste, why the women's movement is portrayed as a bunch of howling, bra-burning, castrating women. Now the answer to that question becomes clearer—just look at the

men who are writing those stories!

My mirror reflects more than my image

Your cheekbone casts the only shadow that I've allowed myself to rest in, for some time now.

Photos by Pingela Mason

And the shade of your mouth, as it speaks, even umbrellas my thoughts... and my life becomes a turned down turned round inside out umbrella drowning in its own secretive joy.

My most unspoken thoughts have sought refuge in the folds of your expression and I've spent many estranged nights in the negative space against your neck.

I say to myself, in defense, of course I'm only resting here—just for a time you understand... 
Resting here, 

in the shadows of your being

And perhaps I should have told you I was here.

BigMammaRag,1,1,,14,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No1_page014.txt,"Before and After

In doing political work, I have  
found myself in situations where it  
has always been very easy for me to  
remain passive—to prefer others,  
“especially men, to do the work that  
I was too insecure or self-  
conscious to do. I have always  
known ""which side I was on,"" but I  
have not always been so sure of the  
reasons why. Never having had much  
practice at actually analyzing sit-  
uations myself, I was therefore  
very impressed (and intimidated) by  
people who could develop complex  
analyses and intellectualizations  
of different situations. This, of  
course, played right into my pas-  
sivity, my willingness to accept  
someone else's theory, my insecuri-  
ty in putting forward my own. Now,  
I am beginning to feel much better  
about myself and I have more confi-  
dence in my abilities to think, and  
this carries over into my relation-  
ships with others. I know that I  
have to PUSH myself to do those  
things that are important to do—  
to participate, to be active—even  
if I may feel terribly uncomfor-  
table and awkward. One of the most  
important factors in this is the  
support I get from my sisters.

Support Raises Consciousness

This support not only makes me  
strong enough to speak out in  
groups and contribute my opinions,  
but I find that it becomes easier  
to do the kind of reading and re-  
search necessary to enable me to  
raise my political consciousness to  
the point where I think it should  
be. It isn't hard anymore to admit  
my ignorance without shame, be-  
cause I know that I have the  
strength to do the self-education  
necessary to remedy that ignorance.  
I feel oftentimes that men are re-  
sentful of this kind of obvious  
strength. I understand that reac-  
tion, but it is only an example of  
the sexism which is in all of us.  
Most of us have learned to be  
threatened by people who are  
strong, who could be potential  
""competition.""

These kinds of hostile, uptight  
reactions are balanced by the  
patronizing, ""older brother"" atti-  
tudes of some other movement men.  
It is almost as if they merely  
tolerate my sympathies with THEIR  
ideas—it makes me feel like a  
movement groupie. And it is an  
obvious indication that those men  
do not consider my political com-  

mitment and understanding to be any-  
where near as serious as their own.

This brings up a question which  
has been especially significant to  
me in dealing with ""hip"" or ""move-  
ment"" men: the question of integra-  
ting my sexuality with my intellect.  
I consider myself a political person,  
and also a sexual person. It has  
been possible for me a number of  
times to have truly meaningful rela-  
tionships with men—relationships in  
which little was hidden, thoughts  
were shared and expressed honestly—  
but these were rarely sexual rela-  
tionships. The most egalitarian ex-  
periences I have had with men were  
not physical at all. And in the  

same way, the sexual relationships I  
have had with men were rarely able  
to develop into anything deeper  
without being extremely sexist—in  
other words, my role in the rela-  
tionship had already been defined in  
a purely sexual way. So, a problem  
arises—in order to keep myself out  
of exploitive situations, I find  
myself continually denying my sexu-  
ality—negating my womanhood in or-  

der to function effectively with men.

I ignore my physical feelings as  
best I can—I have consciously de-  
cided that it is actually safer and  
much less hassle to avoid sexual re-  
lationships with men, at least for  
the time being.

People Change Slowly

I understand that people change  
slowly, and that's why I'm waiting  
and struggling with the people I  
love. But it also makes me very  
angry to constantly try to act dif-  
ferently than I feel—to be unable  
to really be the warm, open person I  
know I can be, because I know people  
don't understand that in the way  
that I mean it. So, I have to be  
cautious. It just isn't worth it  
anymore to make love with a man and  
have it end up the way it usually  
does—with a huge space between us  
afterwards—the cold feeling when I  
realize that suddenly the prelimin-  
ary closeness, the meaningful talk  
is over, because he's finally  

fucked me. And all of the mech-  
anisms I use to keep myself from  
dwelling on the shittiness of it  
all, my rationalizations, my over-  
looking of things he said and did—  
they don't work anymore. I like my-  
self too much now—I respect myself  
and care for myself and I WON'T LET  
IT HAPPEN ANYMORE! So, for now, al-  
though I will work on building hon-  
est relationships with men, I must  
be sure that the sexual aspect is  

as honest as the intellectual.

This brings up another question  
which I have done a lot of thinking  
about recently—that of bisexuality  
or gay relationships. As I become  
more conscious of my womanhood, it  
becomes more difficult for me to  
submit myself to a heterosexual re-  
lationship in which I am uncomfor-  
table or in which I see even the  
most subtle sexist patterns. But  
at the same time, my need for sex-  
ual contact, my sexual frustration,  
continues. And I find that the  
only people I can completely trust  
are the few women I have come to  
love. Because I know that they  
are honestly struggling with their  
sexuality and that they consider  
dealing with sexism (in themselves  
as well as in others) as an ongo-  

ing process that must be integra-  
ted into their everyday existence.  
So it becomes increasingly easy  
for me to think of making love to  
a woman—in fact, that doesn't  
seem at all threatening compared  
to becoming sexually involved with  
a man. It's quite a change for  
me. Until recently I hadn't even  
considered bisexuality, and now in  
many ways it is much more attrac-  
tive than heterosexuality. I'm  
not saying I will cease to be at-  
tracted to men, not at all; just  
that I am now feeling comfortable  
about physical relationships with  
women also.

So what does all this mean? I  
cannot at all see myself with-  
drawing from men completely. I  
live with men, my political work  
must necessarily involve and in-  
clude men. There are a few men  
whom I truly love and trust to a  
large degree. But I know that  
all men—and women too—have a  
thousand subtle, deep-seated  
feelings about each other—  
feelings that we cannot even iden-  
tify, that color our actions in  
ways we haven't even imagined.

And I feel that these feelings op-  
erate most strongly and subcon-  
sciously in those situations that  
are based in emotions and in those  
situations in which we have had  
the least practice at being open  
and honest. Sexual matters are  
the perfect examples of this.

Our society has taught us to be se-  
cretive and non-communicative  
about sex, let alone being embar-  
rassed and ashamed. We cannot  
talk to each other or learn from  
each other. We come together in  
bed and operate from two separate  
points—apart. How can we expect  

to communicate at that stage of the  
game, without any real preliminary  
honesty that deals specifically  
with sex? What I mean is that 99%  
of the time, men whom I sleep with  
are bound to be operating from a  
self-centered position—and nec-  
essarily so—because we probably  
have not been able to deal effec-  
tively with all of the quiet pri-  
vate thoughts, fears, and hang-ups  
we each have about our bodies and  
sex. So, men (and women, too) in  

a sexual relationship will be ac-  
ting out a lot of emotional, large-  
ly irrational responses. Where in-  
tellectually, many people can  
recognize and struggle with sexist  
feelings, in a sexual relationship,  
which is largely emotional, this  
might not be possible.

I am by no means advocating the  
increased intellectualization of  
personal relationships. I am an  
emotional person. What I mean is  
that we must really try to under-  
stand our emotions, our spontaneous  
responses to situations and people.  
And this is very hard—much more  
difficult than changing one's mind  
about a political matter or an in-  
tellectual decision. It goes to  
the very root of how we function as  
human beings, and how we relate to  
others. This is what I see as the  
true struggle—the radical struggle—  
the willingness to examine and deal  
with those very things that govern  
our every moment of existence. 13"

THE BELL JAR

Emotional deterioration of the women
around her, the limited roles they
are confined to. She seeks something
different and is told that she must
become a super-woman, make herself
somehow different from “all those
other women"" and yet still channel
her talents into a restricted mold.

SYLVIA PLATH died on a Monday morning
around 6:00 A.M. She went downstairs
into the kitchen and left

a plate of bread and butter and a
jug of milk for her children.

Then she opened the oven door,

turned on the gas, and laid her

head down.

Her book ""The Bell Jar"" is widely acclaimed now, and her two books of
poetry, ""Colossus"" and ""Ariel"" are
a common sight in all bookstores. 

Still - I wonder how many of her
readers have the power over her life that
will allow her to end the nightmare
that an analytical perceptive
realistic mind shows her daily.

She decides to commit suicide.
Suicide, the last attempt at self
determination, real control over one's
life, a desperate and liberating act.
She is thwarted in her attempt and
describes the hell she underwent in
being forcibly rehabilitated. Esther
was a rebel defeated, and one finds
herself wishing she had won the battle
then, rather than suffer the ten more
years of forced compliance Sylvia did
before she liberated herself from the

mornings began with the hope that
someone might understand, and how
many years of disappointment accumulated
in the process of her life.
Do not just read her book and say
you understand. For unless it
moves you beyond tears and into
some kind of action, your intro-
verted understanding will be of no
use. Do not read her poems and cry,
rather read them with the same anger
with which they were written. And
realize that unless things change,
or until we change things, I can
guarantee you that one of your
friends, my friends, our friends,

will surely do the same one day. The

novel written by Sylvia Plath about
herself in her 20th year of life.

in the face with the reality of
life and what happens to talented
women in our society. It is time to change the picture of reality
now and it was reality in the 50's. Sylvia, speaking through

Emory vs. C.U.

In the Fall of 1971, 333 women
and 2,524 men applied for admiss-
ion to C.U. Med. School. The
school accepted 18 women and 117
men. Women made up the 14% min-

ority and men made up the 86%
majority of the 1971 class.

Ms. Emory was one of the 315
women who were not accepted, and
she did not sit back and view her
rejection with apathy. She filed a
Sex Discrimination Suit against the
University of Colorado Medical
School.

The suit came to trial in the Fall
of 1972, Judge Mitchell B. Johns
presiding, with Martin P. Miller
representing Ms. Emory in the suit.

Two months later Judge Johns
had finally reached a decision.

His verdict echoed almost
word for word C.U.’s Defense Stat-
istics and Logic used in the trial.
He admitted that women are under-
represented in Medical Schools,
but said that C.U. Med. School has
a better representation of women
than most schools.

Angela (another B.M.R. reporter)
and I interviewed Ms. Emory follow-
ing the trial. She had several things
to say to us in regard to the trial.

One of the most important things
she pointed out was the use that C.U.
Med. School made of the ""Equal
Rejection Theory."" The ""Equal Rejec-
tion Theory"" was used through the
courts for many years; it was used
as a basis for discriminating against

racial minorities. Most courts today
refuse to recognize it as a basis for
racial discrimination.

""Equal Rejection"" is based on
separating the number of applicants
into different groups, i.e. black,
white, male, female. C.U. Med.
School separates their applicants in-
to groups of male and female. The
figures they use are the percentage of
applicants accepted from each group.
C.U.'s statistics show that out of
2,524 male applicants, 107 were accep-
ted, a percentage of 4.24 acceptance
of male applicants. Out of 333 female
applicants, 18 were accepted, a per-
centage of 5.4 of the total female
applicants.

When the class make-up is viewed
in this manner, the real class make-
up of 14% women and 86% men is
obscured.

Ms. Emory was also subjected to
interviews at C.U., where questions
were asked about her children's care.
She was asked (about her housekeeper)
""Is she mentally capable of taking care
of your children?"" Another woman app-
licant was asked ""Who'll be the Chief
Cook and bottle washer if you go to
Medical School?"" Ms. Emory wondered
how these questions could possibly
affect their qualifications for entrance
to Medical School.

Ms. Emory was also interviewed by
two psychologists as part of her entrance
requirements. (It is questionable whether
male applicants are submitted to these
interviews.) One hour-long interview
provided C.U. with a negative psychol-
ogical assessment of her potential suc-
cess in Medical School. A second hour

Ms.
appealed to a higher court. The local

courts have bowed to the political pressure
and bigotry which rules the Medical Profess-
ion. A woman of the caliber of Ms. Emory will fight all the
way to the Supreme Court and win.

viewed Ms. Emory is no longer on the
board of admissions.

Although Judge Johns has ruled against

Emory, the case will no doubt be

including C.U. Med. School. A woman

""From the dawn of civil-

important contributions
to society. And, under

the heel of oppression,

women have struggled for
freedom. In asserting
the right of women, we
reclaim our heritage...
Write women back into

A proud and angry statement
that makes you want to run out
and discover your past, isn't
it? It is from a series of
posters of famous women in his-
tory that the Young Socialist
Alliance is producing. I have
put up in my study the intro-
ductory statement and four of
the posters, for inspiration.

Much as I like this series,
however, I sometimes have
trouble with the second state-
ment. First, it tends to mis-
lead us into thinking of women's
history as always, everywhere
the same: women's history e-
quals oppression. Second, we
have to be careful in looking
for antecedents to our own
struggle. Women's ""struggle for
freedom"" did not occur as fre-
quently nor in all the places
one might expect.

For example, the history of
17th and early 18th century wo-
men, particularly the Protestant
women of English descent, should
be approached on its own terms.
If it is forced into the 19th
and 20th century categories of
oppression and liberation, we
only confuse ourselves.

Let us look at the 17th and
early 18th century women. What
exactly would oppression have
meant for these colonial women?
Certainly the attitudes ex-
pressed by literate men about
women left something to be de-
sired. Woman, according to a
very long tradition, was a weak
creature. She was, first, men-
tally weak. Overtaking her
brain by excessive reading and
writing might well unhinge her
mind. This was a pity, but, of
course, she couldn't be blamed
for her inferiority. But there
was a second kind of female
weakness which the early colon-
ial men found positively dis-
concerting. Woman was the
daughter of Eve, and she in-
herited her mother's moral weak-
ness. Worse, like Eve, she had
a seductive power that could
pull men down with her. Al-
though this image of woman as
“the dangerous sex"" was usually
latent, it occasionally sur-
faced as it did in the Salem
witch trials. It was because
of these weaknesses, finally,
that woman was subordinate,
subordinate to her father in
childhood and later to her hus-
band in marriage.

But what did all this intel-
lectualizing actually mean in
the lives of colonial women?

INTO HISTORY

To begin with, the average co-
lonial woman was not well edu-
cated. Most girls who were
educated at all were taught the
rudiments at home or in the sum-
mer sessions of the public
schools if they existed. Even
in Massachusetts, a colony with
a considerable concern for edu-
cation, only 50% of the women
could sign their own names in
the mid 17th century. But how
significant was this depriva-
tion in a society in which edu-
cation was not necessary for
survival and in which most men
were equally deprived? Lack of
educational opportunities did
not mean to the colonial woman
what it would mean to us.

Under English common law in
which woman was declared civil-
ly dead at marriage, woman's
legal status looks oppressive.
However, in America, the harsh-
ness of English law was modi-
fied by Equity law: if a woman
came into a marriage with con-
siderable property of her own

her father would make out a
contract to protect her right
to this property. The law as
practiced protected her rights
in her husband's property. Di-
vorce was permitted when either
party to a marriage could prove
that the other had neglected a
fundamental duty.

The fact that English law
was modified in the American
colonies is significant. Wo-
men were in short supply in
the early period. Companies
who invested in a colony real-
ized how important the pre-
sence of women was to the cre-
ation of a permanent colony
and made efforts to induce wo-
men into coming to the New
World. The London Co. which
underwrote the Virginia colony
advertised for “Agreeable per-
sons, young and incorrupt...
(who would be) sold with their
own consent to settlers as
wives, the price to be the
cost of their own transporta-
tion."" Apparently women
found this offer very attrac-
tive. In 1619 ninety came on
one ship alone. Historians
have speculated that it was in
part this demand for women that
made women's place in colonial
American society much better
than that of their sisters who
remained in the Mother Country.

But even if they had been in
good supply, the work of the
early colonial women, even wo-
men of the wealthier classes,
made them absolutely indispen-
sable. From earliest childhood
when a girl began doing house-
hold and barnyard chores the
female was a useful and pro-
ductive member of her family.
In her early to mid-twenties,
she married and bore on the
average nine to ten children.
Childbearing was hard and the
mother's life expectancy was
7 years less than her husband's.
Two or three of those children
died before they were adults.
Aside from childbearing and
rearing, she was in charge of
the home. It was not the con-
suming home of the 19th century
but the producing home, a small
manufacturing unit which turned
raw materials that the husband
produced—grains, flax, leather,
meat—into usable products.

The woman and her daughter made
all the cloth for the family,
turned the cloth into clothing,
did all the brewing, baking,
and curing of meat. They made
wax and the only form of light-
ing, candles; they made the
family soap out of drippings
and lye, the lye from ashes.
The woman had charge of the fam-
ily garden and of the family
doctoring. It was an extremely
difficult life but through her
work she had the self-respect
and the community respect that

society denied to her 19th cen-
tury sister, the middle class
lady of leisure.

While the majority of women
did essential, respected work
in the home, there was an in-
teresting minority of women who
worked outside the home. ""They
were butchers, silversmiths,
gunsmiths and upholsterers.

They ran mills, tanneries, ship-
yards and every kind of shop,
tavern and boarding house. They
were gatekeepers, jail keepers,
sextons, journalists, printers,
doctoresses, apothecaries, mid-
wives, nurses and teachers.""
This comes as a surprise because
we usually think of women’s work
outside the home and in the pro-
fessions coming in the 19th cen-
tury, after a long and bitter
struggle. Apparently, however,
the prejudice against middle
class women working outside

the home, the horror with

which men heard women's de-
mands to be something more

than just wives and mothers,

was an idea that emerged not
early, but late, with the

growth of wealth and the bour-
geois culture of the late 18th
and 19th centuries.

So we come back to the ori-
ginal question, can we call
these conditions under which
colonial women lived, oppres-
sive to women as women? The
evidence of the oppression of
women per se is far from over-
whelming.

But sometimes we do find a
woman who was dissatisfied with
her position as a woman. I
wonder sometimes how Anne
Hutchinson, an early religious
rebel who ran intellectual cir-
cles around the governor of
Massachusetts Bay colony at her
trial, felt about the charge
that headed the list of com-
plaints against her, that she
had inspired other women to be
""rather...a Husband than a
Wife."" We have no evidence
that Mistress Hutchinson was
anything but a religious rebel
but we have a little in the
case of another Anne. Anne

Bradstreet came to the American
colonies in 1630 as the bride
of an early governor of Massa-
chusetts. She was a poet, one
of the earliest in the English
colonies. Her poems run the
gamut from long philosophical
ones like ""The Flesh and the
Spirit"" to love poems written
to her ""dear and loving hus-
band.""
If ever two were one,
then surely we.
If ever man were loved
by wife, then thee...
But as happy as Anne was with
her marriage, she occasionally
spoke out against a society
that refused to take her intel-
lectual work seriously.
I am obnoxious to
each carping tongue
Who says my hand a
needle better fits,
A poet's pen all scorn
I should thus wrong,
For such despite they cast
on female wit:
If what I do prove well,
it won't advance,
They'll say it's stol'n,
or else it was by chance.
Despite the two Annes how-
ever, I think the evidence suc-
gests that given the frontier
conditions of the early colon-
ies in which life was equally
hard for both men and women,
and where women's work was as
vital and as respected as that
of the ordinary man's, great
debates about the essential e-
quality or inferiority of women
probably seemed to most people,
men and women alike, somewhat
irrelevant. A movement of op-
pressed women awaited a revolu-
tionary ideology of equality
and, at least as important, the
change of status forced on women
by the new industrial society
of the 19th century.

No. There is not as much writ-
ten about early colonial women
as there is about later women,
Elizabeth Dexter's Colonial Wo-
men of Affairs is the only book
about colonial women's work
outside the home. John Demos
has written a very good little
book on the colonial family, The
Little Commonwealth. Root of
Bitterness, a new collection of
documents edited by Nancy Cott,
has a couple of court trans-
criptions, Anne Hutchinson's
and a woman who was accused
of witchcraft. There are bio-
graphies of Anne Hutchinson a-
round including one by a man
who attributed her rebellion to
menopause! Perry Miller's The
American Puritans contains sev-
eral of Anne Bradstreet's poems
and in yellowed notes from col-
lege I have listed a book by
J.H. Ellis, The Work of Anne
Bradstreet, if you really want
to get into it.

A friend who read the column
last time said she was compiling
a women's history bibliography
from the books I mention. She
suggested others do the same.

The Mountain States Women's Abortion Coalition (MSWAC) held a ""Crimes Against Women Tribunal"" on Saturday, November 11, at the CU Denver Center Auditorium. The purpose of the event was to present personal testimony of women who have had difficult experiences regarding abortions, birth control information, rape, welfare and health departments, and all areas of female oppression. Another purpose of the Tribunal was to publicly demonstrate that incidents of women's oppression are not isolated—that many, many women have experiences of this kind.

These are some of the comments made by participants:

""In Utah a person cannot get contraceptive help if she is under 18 without parental consent. I got pregnant when I was 16. My parents are middle-class Catholics and I'd always been taught that abortion was murder. They sent me to a priest for advice. Apparently, when your mother is the president of the Parish's Catholic Women's Club, abortion is OK. He suggested that I get an abortion.""

A psychiatric nurse pointed out that ""repeal of all abortion laws would be great, but then there would be problems with Denver's medical community, which is very conservative and would probably stop doing abortions altogether if there were no laws to protect them.""

The Chairwoman stressed the need to ask for ""more than we hope to get.""

Attorney Sandy Nemser discussed prostitution as a class issue based on the distinction between call girls and whores. Referring to the then upcoming election, Nemser quoted Gloria Steinem: ""If McGovern got pregnant, he'd come to some sort of decision about what to do about it. If Nixon got pregnant, he'd go ahead and get an abortion, deny it, and swear he was a virgin.""

The Chairwoman announced that folksinger Judy Collins had planned to testify at the Tribunal but was unable to attend at the last minute. Collins made the point that she did not want to sing, but just to say how she felt.

Pat Schroeder, at that time campaigning for Congress from the First Congressional District, spoke openly about a woman's right to control her own body. She pointed out that Congress has given priority to heart and cancer research, but that birth control and reproductive research have not been as important to Congress. She then pointed out that only 12 out of 435 members of Congress are women.

A young woman from Fort Worth, Texas, said that she had made the decision not to have children and that as a heterosexual saw her choices as ""(1) Taking a pill a day for thirty years, (2) having a series of abortions, or (3) getting a tubal ligation."" She tried to get a tubal ligation, but ""no doctor in the phone book of Fort Worth would give me one because they didn't think I needed one.""

The Chairwoman introduced a gay woman from Boulder as ""wanting to speak to express solidarity with us and our problems,"" to which the speaker replied, ""Solidarity is not the question, because we're all women."" She went on to discuss the health dangers of contraceptive pills and to offer some suggestions in dealing with rapists.

A female lawyer from Legal Aid remarked, ""What I've learned (in working at Legal Aid) is that women are victims and see themselves as victims, especially poor women.""

An attorney from the National Lawyers' Guild said: ""Abortion really is a class problem because it was never a problem with a rich woman... you could always go to San Juan."" He went on to quote Tolstoy: ""'The rich will do anything for the poor, except get off their backs.' The same goes for men and women.""

One evening in Venice, Cali-
fornia a couple of years ago a
friend and I, in a fit of bour-
geois debauchery, sat drinking
Scotch and water over a hand of
rummy. I was keeping up a pat-
ter of light conversation to
hide the fact that I was losing
the game. The light conversa-
tion being the women's movement.
My friend was basically a cynic
and I was into the revolution:
down with the ruling class (the
rich) and worry about petty de-
tails like the alleged oppres-
sion of women later. Not want-
ing to be accused of turning on
my own people I always gave a
polite interest to the rising
fury of women, but frankly I
felt that it was an unnecessary
factionalization of the radical
movement (whatever that was).
Actually what was happening was
that I was getting my political
analysis from the circle of male
politicos, well-read and arti-
culate, that made up many of my
close friends at that time.

So anyhow, over the Scotch,
Joyce and I sat talking. ""You
know,"" sez I, being just as cute
as hell, “some of my best friends
are men."" We kicked that around
for a while. We came to the con-
clusion that even worse than that
(and, it's true) is that few of
my best friends at that time were
women. I began to consider that
maybe it wasn't some kind of ac-
cident that most of the women I
knew were as boring as hell:
never activating anything on
their own, but existed only in
their relationship to some guy
somewhere, like my boyfriend
this or that. It is pretty hard
to gain valuable companionship
from a person who ain't even
there. Many things, thoughts
that had been laying dormant in
the back of my mind came into
being that evening. Mostly they
concerned my own identity: not
exactly who I was, but definitely
who I was not.

I was in love with James Dean.

Through the course of our con-
versation that night we discov-
ered that we had never seriously
thought of ourselves as women.
Our heroes were male. I was in
love with James Dean—in fact, I
adored James Dean—I idolized
him. That passion, that heaviness
of misunderstood youth,
that sensitivity suppressed and
manifesting in violence. He
seemed so real. In a word, I
wanted to be James Dean. And
it had never occurred to me un-
til this drunken evening that I
could never be him, not even in
a hundred years of affected
heaviness. No, cruel world, I
would have to be James Dean's
woman. I would have to be pa-
tient with that passion. I
would have to be understanding
of his confusion. I would have
to be tolerant of his self-

exploration. Oh shit, a self-
image torn from me. For my
friend and I could suddenly see
that all the admirable traits
that we so loved in our heroes
were reserved for males and for
us was the role of the woman be-
hind the man.

Valour, bravery, adventure,
commitment to an ideal, the hun-
gry intellect, the bursting to
explore the world around us:
in our society these attributes
are neither recognized nor condoned
in women. With the most outrageous
blatancy and with every subtlety
the role of contented mother is
enforced in our psyches. And the
goal of life, the final (ABSOLUTELY
FINAL) glory to our beings is to
be chosen by the best man we can
get (of course, as you grow past
youthful beauty you must lower
your expectations somewhat so as
not to be left unchosen). Our
beings, after we have left our
father’s house, are defined by
the man who has chosen us. And
how proud we can be to be picked
by one of those fine noble men,
the man with a social conscience,
the man with high standing in
the community, the liberal-
minded man who is proud of his
wife, who wants her to put forth
her ideas, in the PTA and in
Democratic Party Women's lunch-
eons. How lucky we can consider
ourselves at being absolved of
the responsibility of having to
define ourselves, of having to
activate our own life—for we
will simply be judged by whom we
have married.

a devastating revelation

Perhaps for some of you read-
ing this it is not much of a
revelation. For my friend and
I it was devastating. Suddenly
there was a limitation put on
us—or rather it was not sudden,
only we had just become aware of
it. We had before obviously al-
lowed ourselves the delusionary
luxury of relegating ourselves
to the special position of excep-
tional women. We considered our-

selves apart and above that de-
plorable mass of women with their
self-imposed dullness and insipid
characters. In our stupid
ignorance, we had assumed that
each individual female was to
blame for her own lack of self-
growth.

For we had not understood the
dynamics of the culturized, in-
stitutionalized, and yet worse,
internalized concept of women in
this society. A role so linear
and confining as motherhood is
expected to fulfill our self-
hood. It is hardly the stuff a
girl child should be expected to
dream on. Unfortunately it is
not only expected to be the
dream stuff of the girl child,
but the reality of the grown
woman. With the highest sophis-
tication of the capitalist econ-
omy women are preyed upon with
this artificial picture of
femaleness. There can be no mis-
taking of the image: ever
searching for ways to be even
more attractive to our mate,
like somehow we owe him that for
his choosing us. Ever search-
ing for new and better ways of
serving our family, unselfishly
devoting the rest of our lives
to their happiness. In a sense,
forgetting your self to serve
other selves. And even more
disheartening is that there was
no alternative to this lifestyle
for a woman, only sad excuses.

dictated roles

The role of mother for each and
every woman has been dictated to
us with the import of religion,
in the sense that to try to es-
cape or alter this fate is the
same as blasphemy to most
people.

We, I, have internalized much
of this propaganda about what a
woman is. I have internalized
it to a point that I very much
need the support and under-
standing of women who are exper-
iencing these same things. Per-
haps now we can begin to explore
who we CAN be. It will be a
long and hard struggle because
we are defying a role which is

BigMammaRag,1,2,,7,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page007.txt,"A CONVERSATION WITH DENVER’S

THE FOLLOWING IS A REPORT AND ANALYSIS OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH PAT SCHROEDER, RECENTLY
ELECTED DENVER CONGRESSWOMAN, GRANTED TWO STAFF MEMBERS FROM BIG MAMA RAG, J. BRYSON
AND M. WATERS. 

WE FEEL THAT CRITICIZING THE WOMAN'S IDEAS SERIOUSLY MEANS THAT WE TAKE THAT FOR OURSELVES.

THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT WILL GROW STRONGER ONLY BY CAREFULLY EXAMINING WHAT WE ARE DOING POLITICALLY.

Pat Schroeder's campaign slogan read, ""She wins. We win."" But did we, the women who are her constituents, really win? A recent interview with the Denver Congresswoman-elect raises some interesting questions.

For example, when asked where she stood on women's issues, Ms. Schroeder replied, ""You know, I don't have any problems with that at all. The whole campaign was still run as a humanist campaign. It seems to me that I'm not pushing for men, I'm not pushing for women. I'm not pushing for children. We're pushing for people, and that's what the whole darn thing's about. . . Everybody wants a fair crack at it without looking at whether they're male, female, black, brown, old, young. . .

Furthermore, in responding to a question dealing with what kinds of specific legislation Ms. Schroeder plans to work for while in Congress, she cited at least seven different concerns without so much as mentioning even one issue which deals directly with the problems of women as women in this country today. (Abortion, child care, job discrimination, etc.)

Listed under ""New Directions, '72-'76,"" the Democratic Platform states, ""We are determined to remove barriers that limit citizens because they are black, brown, young, or women; because they never had the chance to gain an education; because there was no possibility of being anything but what they were."" Although Ms. Schroeder's stands are certainly in line with this ideal, that is all it is--an ideal. In other words, it is of primary importance at this particular time in history for minority groups and women to identify themselves as such first. Of course we are all working ultimately for human liberation, but if we spread ourselves as thinly as cheap mayonnaise over too many causes, we may end up with only an ineffectual thin coating of liberality.

When approached on this point--that certain groups (particularly women) must work for their own rights first, Schroeder had this to say, ""Sure it's important for women to seek an identity and I'm not putting that down at all. But I'm also saying that you can't just do that to the exclusion of everything else.""

BMR: ""To be successful in politics, you mean?”

SCHROEDER: ""I don’t even think — that's it. I just don't believe in any one issue. I'm also concerned about peace. If I had to pick one thing, it would probably be peace--defense spending, Armed Forces, environment. . . Those are equally as important. If I stood up and said that I'm primarily concerned about women's rights, I'd be lying. I'm very concerned about women's rights, but no more so than I'm concerned about peace, environment. . .

THIS ANALYSIS IS A CRITICAL ONE. NO ONE SPEAKS FOR US. IDEAS OF ANOTHER WOMAN IS NOT OPPOSED TO SISTERHOOD.

And I just don't believe in getting hung-up on one issue. I find the world is full of one-issue people. They've got tunnel vision.""

This all sounds very convincing, of course. I mean, who would dare say that anything was more important than peace? The fact remains, however, that women have been railroaded by this line of reasoning since the first voices were raised in protest. ""Let's get to the most important things first and then we'll work on your problems,"" say the liberal male politicians and others. That's just another side-stepping tactic to keep us quiet and in ""our places."" Naturally, we are all concerned about peace and the environment as well as many other current issues, but how can we as women always work effectively for those issues when our very effectiveness is already limited by the fact that we are women.

Bella Abzug, the N.Y. Congresswoman is involved with many contemporary problems, but women's issues are usually a priority. Similarly, Ron Dellums, the black Congressman from California is working for a great number of issues but black concerns are of the utmost importance. That kind of identification is not a display of “tunnel vision"" or of “one-issue candidacy."" Ms. Abzug, Mr. Dellums, and others know who they are and just what it is they stand for.

When Pat Schroeder was asked how she came to be identified as a liberal congresswoman, she said, ""Well, I've never really identified myself as anything. I think so often you end up getting into a psychological briar patch. . . And I've tried never to really identify with anything that way."" And responding to a question asking whether she considered herself to be a feminist, Ms. Schroeder replied, ""Oh, I've always identified myself as a woman. Let me back up. To some extent I've never really liked, like the Women's Division of the Bar because I've always figured that men and women practice law the same. It's ridiculous. It should be an integrated bar. Theoretically, we all do the same thing. In law school once, they said, ‘Would you teach a course in women's legal rights?' And I said, ‘Well, no one's teaching one in male's legal rights.' What I think they should do is a bigger picture in, let's say, discrimination. Do the whole thing. . . Don't just do women, don't just do blacks, not just Indians. And I think that's the focus you have to keep on. I've never tried to hide the fact that I'm a woman. I think that any kind of sex discrimination is just awful. I'm not one of those women who say, ‘Gee, I've never found that.' Because I certainly found it everywhere I."
BigMammaRag,1,2,,8,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page008.txt,"went. I fly airplanes. Women

aren't supposed to do that. I went
to Harvard Law School. Women aren't
supposed to do that either. And you
smile and get along and wish you
didn't have to. But you tolerate

it. So I don't say I've never felt
it. I think it's there. But I

still think the whole thing is having
everybody becoming tolerant... of
different living styles, of different
variances in personality. I think
it's a whole thing of human rights.
I'm obviously saying I’m a woman,

but I'm not gonna stand up and say:
""I am for women."" Because you then
immediately become a one-issue can-
didate. Or at least the press will
make you a one-issue candidate.

There is, however, a very great
difference between being identified
as a woman and identifying your-
self with women. The essence of
feminism is not simply that we
“want a fair crack at it."" It is
more a restructuring of the way
people relate to one another as well
as an identification with the his-
tory and culture of women.

Sex discrimination is not ""just
awful."" It is an insidious kind of
animal leash which has choked off the
possibilities of capable women every-
where for thousands of years. Teach-
ing a course in women's legal rights
would not make a woman a female
chauvinist. Pat Schroeder herself
has admitted that ""the power struc-
ture is totally unthreatened by
us"" because ""they know we're out-
siders."" A woman's legal position
before the law is unique—perhaps
more so than any other group's. Re-
cognizing that men have made the
laws and that those laws benefit
them, it is absurd to pretend that
a course in ""male's legal rights""
is necessary to justify the same for
women. That would be like saying
that a course in discrimination
against whites is necessary before
there can be one in discrimination
against blacks!

Years ago individual blacks could
get along in a white world by ""smil-
ing and being tolerant,"" and per-
haps today one woman can get along
in a man's world by the same ques-
tionable methods. There may be per-
sonal success in doing that. Nev-
ertheless, if we as women are to
identify ourselves with all women,
tolerance and subtlety are not al-
ways the answers. (That is not to
say necessarily that yelling and
screaming are either. Obviously
different styles succeed in different
situations.) To answer the question
of discrimination with tolerance,
however, is to be separate and above
other women, who need the voice of
a congresswoman desperately! Pat
Schroeder says that she is ""very
concerned with women's rights, but
no more so than with some other is-
sues."" It seems to us that it is
much less so. Women do desperately
need the voice of a congresswoman—
a share in her power.

A friend of mine recently made
her own bumper sticker to place
next to Pat Schroeder's slogan, ""She
Wins. We win."" It read, ""She won.
We won.” We'd all like to be able
to say that, too—and mean it.

Pat Schroeder is not a feminist.
At least, not yet.

SOME FURTHER EXCERPTS FROM BIG MAMA

BIG MAMA RAG: IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC
REASON WHY YOU DECIDED TO RUN FOR
CONGRESS?

PAT SCHROEDER: Well, if you're
going to change Congress, you've
got to change the kinds of people
you send there. And I'm very tired
of young men on power trips. I
think we've suffered greatly from
that kind of government.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THE NEW WOMEN
IN CONGRESS ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF
PERSON THAN THESE MEN ON EGO TRIPS?
SCHROEDER: Sure. Yvonne Braith-
waite’s father was a janitor.
Barbara Jordan came out of the South.
We certainly were not a wealthy
family by any means. And yet you
go back and see many of them (con-
gressmen) and they've inherited the
They come from the business
structure or political family. Or
they have certain ties, or they’ve
been ego-maniac types that have been
smooth pretty boys that have been
able to work their way up, and back
scratch a lot. And I really don't
see the women doing that. They've
always announced, ""This is where
I was. This is where I stand. Take
it or leave it.”

BMR: WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION DOES
THAT HAVE WITH THEIR BEING WOMEN? DO YOU THINK IT HAS ANY?
SCHROEDER: I think a lot of it is
they've been shut out anyway, and
they couldn't get in on the back-
The
power structure is totally un-
threatened by us. (women) They
know we're outsiders.

BMR: DO YOU THINK WOMEN WOULD GO
ON THE SAME TYPES OF TRIPS THAT MEN
HAVE?

SCHROEDER: Oh, sure. Nothing makes
me madder than to encounter a woman
who's made it and says: “I've never
Or:
You know,
She's emulating—

If you're going
to emulate the suppressor, then you
have no right to rise to the top.

BMR: ARE THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT
YOU'VE CONSIDERED MODELS? THAT YOU'VE LOOKED UP TO AND RESPECTED?
SCHROEDER: I think one of the
greatest persons I can think of is
Albert Schweitzer. He could have
stayed in Europe and had a phenomenal
career on the concert circuit...
but instead he opted not to give up
music, because it was his love, but
he opted to be a doctor and help
people in Africa.

BMR: IS THERE A WOMAN WHOM YOU
PARTICULARLY ADMIRE?

SCHROEDER: Umm. I really must
say I admire most of all... the
hoards of women who have gone be-
fore us... really bought the line
about being more responsible, more
reasonable and allow their husband,
you know... Incredible the amount
of sacrifice. Anybody who was
able to buy it, and do it was just
almost beyond my comprehension. It's just give give give give give
and no take, thank you, and there
have been incredible amounts of
women like that.

BMR: DO YOU THINK THAT'S ADMIR-
ABLE OR KIND OF STUPID?

SCHROEDER: Well, we're living in a
different time, you know... I
think women have been the givers of
society and I've always admired the
givers more than the takers. And I
think one of the reasons I admire
Albert Schweitzer so much is that he
didn't have to be a giver, he could
have been a taker—because he was a
man and males were expected to be
the takers... People always say
how neat it was for you to run for
Congress and I keep saying it wasn't
nearly so neat of me as it was of my
husband. He could have absolutely
verboten it. He had the power to
shut it off... There was no ques-
tion. If he had demanded a divorce
immediately, every male in the city
would have understood. He has the
power. I don't. I'm on the out-
side asking for it. It's much
easier for me to ask for it than
it is for him to give it up. He has
the power to say: ""No. I stay in
Denver with my law practice and my
very secure position."" Women have
had to give up for years, and men
haven't, and so I'm always much
more respectful of the one having the
power and giving it up. It's tougher.
He's in the power structure of
Denver. He's giving all that up and
going to Washington where he's total-
ly unknown.

BMR:.. WHY DID HE DO IT?

SCHROEDER: Oh, I don't know. I
just think he's been very sym-
pathetic to the cause all along.
He's been—I shouldn't say radi-
calized—but he's become sensitized
by being in that position. (i.e.,

Dear Mama:

A week or so ago I picked up a copy of your newspaper at the MSWAC Abortion Tribunal. I am very impressed with the paper and with my hardworking sisters in Denver. The article on Sex and The Struggle by Carol was very encouraging to me personally.

Is there a possibility of me receiving copies of your paper on a regular basis? There is no organized Women's group here at U.N.C. and seemingly little interest in starting one so I feel the need for the stimulus your paper gives me.

Please let me know about this as soon as you can,

Love—and that's the truth...
Susan Steedman

Dear People,

It's been emphasized that as women we ought to learn how to really communicate and thus cease viewing each other as threats. However, women are one part of the whole. The truth is, people are not communicating with people.

This capitalistic society possesses a unique way of keeping us humans alienated. It's called ""competition.""

Most women only see other women as competitors because they define themselves in terms of ""beauty"" (society's conception of what beauty is — blond, 36 bust, etc.), wealth and status.

However, men aren't relating for the same basic reasons. And one can't view another as a potential friend if one's worried about whether the poor dude is outdoing you. ""He's fucked more chicks than I, He's sexier. His penis is bigger. He makes 10 grand, I make 8. I've only got a Mustang and he's got a Porsche.""

It's really time to stop evaluating our beings in terms of the outside standards of beauty, wealth and status. When we realize our capacity as humans for such forsaken emotions as compassion, love (not sex) and understanding, we can afford to halt competition.

When this is ended we can realize that our sisters and brothers are not mere obstacles on some road to success who we must beat out or get ahead of. Perhaps then we can see each other as humans with emotional needs and finally reach out and embrace each other instead of crushing one another. Relating to women and men will only come after redefining our goals and worths in terms of humanity.

BigMammaRag,1,2,,10,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page010.txt,"SOME THOUGHTS ON WOMEN AND

mental health for over two years
now. Though I have many criti-
cisms of and disagreements with
frequent practices and attitudes
in the field, I will restrict
this discussion to women—and
how their (our) position in this
society is constantly reinforced
by therapists.

I shall cite a few specific
examples of what I am talking
about.

A behavior modification pro-
gram is designed for a female
patient. Among the expected be-
haviors (for which she will earn
such ""privileges"" as eating,
smoking cigarettes, going on an
outing) are hair setting, bed-
making and wearing make-up. Is
hair setting truly an indication
of a well-functioning woman?
Perhaps to these therapists. Or
wearing make-up? I do neither
and haven't for years, and con-
sider myself a well-functioning
woman. And what about making
one's bed? That's another thing
I seldom do, and many of my
friends seldom do. Our defini-
tions of sick and healthy, nor-
mal and abnormal behavior, feel-
ings and needs, must be changed.

Another woman, perhaps be-
tween the ages of 17 and 25, en-
ters a hospital in a ""post-par-
tum psychotic episode"". This is
the label assigned a woman who
becomes depressed immediately
after giving birth. She may
stop eating, stop talking, and
perhaps even reject the child
she has just birthed. Is this
truly sick? Perhaps she is de-
pressed because she suddenly
realized that her schooling will
end, or that her career is over.

Or that she is now, for the next
15 years or so, responsible for
another human being. Responsible
for her/his health, both physical
and mental. Perhaps she recog-
nizes that her life is no longer
her own, that she is expected to
dedicate it to another human
being, and pretty much ignore her
own needs and longings. And
what if she doesn't want to do
this? Then she is made to feel
guilty by those around her. Made
to feel she is inadequate as a
woman, as a human being. Women
are not expected to spend their
lives pursuing their own goals.
They are expected to have as
their primary goal dedication to
another, or two or three (hus-
band, children) human beings. A
woman in post-partum depression
is usually convinced by her ther-
apist, and perhaps her loved
ones (as well as other patients)
that it is ""sick"" of her to have
become depressed. That being a
mother is the ultimate experience
a woman can have. And perhaps so,
for some women. But I suspect
that if more options were truly
open to us, more and more women
would choose not to become
mothers—ever. I suspect that were
the burden of child-rearing shifted,
either severally or collectively,
that the rate of post-partum
psychosis would decrease.

An older woman, perhaps 55,
enters the hospital in deep de-
pression. Her diagnosis is in-
volutional melancholia. Involu-
tional melancholia is described
as being distinguished from psy-
chotic depressive reaction in that
the depression ""is not due to some
life experience"". Perhaps being a
woman and growing old in this
society is not considered enough
of a ""life experience"" to cause
depression. Perhaps having
completed one's positive role in
this society, as sex object and
mother, should not cause a woman
to become depressed. But if a
woman grows up thinking, as most
women in America do, that her
worth, her significance as a
human being, depends on her youth,
beauty and charm (her sexual at-
tractiveness) and her function as
mother, then certainly when she
loses these roles we shouldn't be
surprised that she is depressed.
Nor should we consider her de-
pression a problem. It is a
problem created by the arbitrary
expectations placed on women in
this society—that they devote
their energies to the children
and husband, and that they remain
young. Their depression is valid
and understandable.

And I hope and ache that the
depression changes to anger which
she will direct where it belongs—
not on herself, but on the sys-
tem. And how is such a woman
treated? Few therapists are in
touch with, let alone point out
to such a patient, that it is not
she who is ""sick"", but the soci-
ety. Few therapists recognize
that it is a sick society that
permits people to feel worthless
at age 50, or thinks it healthy
that a human being live her life
vicariously through her husband
and children, or that she be sub-
servient for most of her adult
life. What frequently happens is
that the woman is given electro-
convulsive therapy—shock therapy
to the layperson. Or she is
placed on anti-depressants and
put in a therapy group where she
is counseled that her life is
not over, and it's silly for her
to think it is, or for her to
want to end it.

Would you want to end yours?
Have you known anyone who has or
has wanted to? Were you able to
get in touch with why? I can.
And it makes my blood boil to
know that most women today will
be depressed, either mildly or
severely, and consider it ""their
problem"" and even feel guilty
for needing care and being un-
able to cook and clean for their
husbands because of their depres-
sion. It makes me angry to know
that it will be years before this
changes. Years before male
therapists start to really under-
stand what it is like to be a
woman in this society. Years to be
aware of their own per-

sonal oppression as women, in
all its subtle manifestations—
and years before women patients
stand up and start saying, “
SCREAMING:
NO! I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO
THE MYTH!"
BigMammaRag,1,2,,11,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No2_page011.txt,"Most books written for chil-
dren are insidious perpetuators
of a crippling status quo.
Looking back over our own
childhood favorites, we were
disconcerted to find that we
were exposed to a rather narrow
range of life experiences and
roles in literature. Remember
Nancy (WASP) Drew, whose blond
hair flew in the wind as she
rushed from mystery to mystery
in her brand new sports coupe?
And Peter Pan, surrounded by
sexy little Tinkerbelle and the
capable Wendy, and who never
has to grow up and deal with
growing relationships with real
and mature people?

We want children to have a
broader range of reading avail-
able to them - books that offer
alternative values and models
for new ways of functioning.

We must encourage our children
to develop thoughtful analyses
of the printed word from a
very early age, in order that
they may emerge stronger and
more perceptive from exposure
to the abundance of bad books
designed for them.

CENSORSHIP

Censorship robs a child of
a variety of reading experiences,
both good and bad, and denies
the child a chance to develop
his/her discriminatory powers.
However, unless he/she is exposed
to alternatives to prevailing
limits of sex-class-race-age
stereotyping, it will be hard
for any child to see a way out
of the confinement of life
situations presented in tradi-
tional childhood reading
material.

CRITERIA

We set out to explore the
available market in children's
literature. Very few books,
we found, could satisfy our
criteria - that they be non-sex-
ist, non-racist, and non-condes-
cending to young readers - in
other words, that they be
non-chauvinistic in every sense.
Even fewer were interesting,
well-written, or reasonably
priced.

LITTLE MISS MUFFET FIGHTS BACK

The trend in books for little
children is to present very
beautiful, adult-aimed illustra-
tions, accompanied by inane text,
or sugar-coated, but hardly
disguised didacticism. Grownups
are always right in the end;
(white, men) doctors and (white,
motherly) teachers and nurses
and (strong, white, manly)
policemen are not to be disputed.
They will unfailingly lead a
child from pain and error into
the right.

We read a large portion of
the books suggested in a list
called “Little Miss Muffet
Fights Back,"" printed by Femi-
nists on Children's Media.

These books are principally for
older boys and girls. Most of
them feature girls in major roles;
however, they are limited to

anti-Communism,
youthful adventures;

the world to seek adventure,
gets to keep his pet rabbit for
him, or take care of his dog.

It is made clear that true love

stereotypical behavior and the
stories are thoroughly laced with
ladylike demeanor;
silent male

in the end,
the girls turn for help and
approval. The typical heroine
is either a fairy princess or
the cook-and-mother-figure in
and the
""different"" girl, who has no
interest in boys, but wants to

pursue her own interests or
develop her own skills eventually
finds real happiness in the
form of a boyfriend. As
consolation for having to stay

home when her boyfriend goes
to sea, or for having to mind

the hearth while he goes out into
she

's the only happiness for a girl,

that happiness is the only goal

in life, and that this love-
leading-to-happiness consists

of women's silent sacrifice.

FOR LITTLE BOYS

The role models presented
to little boys, although
generally allowing for greater
assertiveness and self-expression
are also limiting, in that they
communicate repeatedly the
importance of competition,
strength, daring, and masterful-
ness, and deny the importance
of softness, sharing, feeling
and reciprocal relationships
with strong, daring, and master-
ful little girls.

We did find several excel-
lent bibliographies of Feminist
literature, which contain
suggestions also for children's
reading. The Feminist Press
at State University of New York,
College at Old Westbury, Box
334, Old Westbury, New York 11568,
lists many sources; KNOW Press,
P.O. Box 86031, Pittsburgh, PA,
15221, publishes a very
comprehensive bibliography of
Women's Literature; the Denver
Public Library, while limited
in Feminist Children's Literature,
has several useful pamphlets in
its ""Heritage"" series.

From our own explorations
we offer the following (by no
means complete) list of books
we liked, remembering that the
influence of children's books
lies less in the ideology

presented, but finally in the

ability of a child to analyze
what he/she reads, to consider
the printed word from the
perspective of a person who
knows him/herself as a whole
and valuable individual whose
ideas and feelings are valid
and important. We list the
following books as an alterna-
tive presentation to the tradi-
tional portrayal of chauvinism
in our culture's sex roles,
race roles, age roles, and to
economic exploitation
in the name of and over the
bodies and psyches of persons
coerced into those roles.

Both the RIP Bookstore,
at 737 E. 17th Avenue, and
the Woman's Voice Bookstore,
673 South Pearl, are attempting
to stock the above books on
their shelves. The books
should be available soon.

In future issues of Big
Mama Rag, we plan to review
children's books regularly,
and we welcome suggestions and
additions to our list.

After a year of consciousness-raising and unfocused political actions, our group decided to direct its energies towards the Women's Health Movement, which we feel has real revolutionary implications for the whole Feminist Movement. Women have lost the power we once had over our own bodies and been forced into dependency on a male-controlled medical profession motivated by profit. There was a time when women were responsible for the health care of their own families and households and midwives responsible for all gynecological and obstetrical care. Reclaiming control of our bodies from the medical industry, Madison Avenue, and big business is a basic step in gaining control of our lives.

Three women in our group traveled to Los Angeles and San Francisco about the same time and gleaned some information from the women's centers about what was happening in women's health. One of these women went back to L.A. and attended a self-health course which met weekly. She learned the simple procedures; she brought back the experience, some literature, and a dozen speculums; and Colorado Springs had its first self-health session that week. We found that our fears and self-consciousness vanished almost at once with the excitement that came with the first real knowledge about our bodies.

We realized why physicians have been reluctant to share their information ($$$) and, more important, we realized we were making a reality out of the slogan ""Control of our own bodies.""

We have found that what works most effectively for us is to have three sessions with each small group of women (about 6-8 has been maximum). Our first session always begins with a ""rap time"" when many fears, misconceptions, resentments, and experiences about things like sex, reproduction, and physiology are shared. We find in sharing our experiences that each woman has at some point in her life been mistreated by physicians, and for many it has been a general rule.

One woman we know, having suffered severe cramps for several months, went to her doctor to have her Dalkon shield (IUD) removed. She learned that the device had slipped and that her cervix had dilated. She had been having labor pains for months! (She was led to believe that discomfort was normal in using an IUD.) The irony is that because she knew the cervix would have to be dilated for removal of the device, and because she wanted a non-messy, constant means of birth control besides the pill, she had it removed only as a last resort. Had she been participating in self-health and examining herself on a regular basis, she would have known there was a real problem and would have gone much sooner for help.

Each woman at the first session purchases a packet made up of good factual literature, her own speculum, and the other necessary supplies for self-examination. There are always at least two women present who have been through the recommended three sessions and feel confident about the procedures. These two women demonstrate to the group how to use the speculum and how to give bi-manual (two hands) pelvic examinations and then invite each woman to participate. If for any reason a woman prefers not to take part, of course she needn't do so. So far every woman has been eager for her turn. Seeing your cervix for the first time is a mind-blow! The mystery is gone, and you gain a new liking for your own body.

In the second session most of our anxiety and self-consciousness is gone. We are able to notice more in our examinations (what is a ""tipped uterus""? what are the differences in the cervix of a woman who has had children and one who has not? what are the normal changes in color, shape, and size of the cervix?) Rap-time might be discussing the written material distributed the previous week, or any other subject of interest; we have much to learn from each other.

Either the second or third session is a good time to learn breast self-examination, using the step-by-step procedures explained in a handout sheet.

By the third session, women are usually turned on to the political implications of self-health and to the fact that getting to know ourselves may save our lives. We've been killing ourselves with panic abortion methods, going without PAP smears, etc. We hope that women will continue examining themselves on a regular basis from now on. And now many of these women are ready to start new groups, which is how the movement spreads.

The week of October 11-14th a National Self-Health Conference was held in Iowa City in which women from all over the U.S. and even Canada got together to share their questions and knowledge about women's health. We have divided into geographic regions in order to spread self-health to all our sisters in the quickest and most effective way. Women of our region were present from Colorado Springs, Nebraska, and Utah, and we plan to reach out to other states in the coming months.

Women from Self-Health Clinic I in California (the Feminist Women's Health Center in L.A.) were the originators of the national conference and gave us ideas from their own experience over the past two years. We learned skills, saw films, attended workshops, and generally got turned on to the potential of the women's health movement.

We in Colorado Springs are hoping soon to start work in abortion counseling and referral, wider self-health reach-out (to non-feminist women's groups, for example), patient advocacy (i.e. going along with sisters to doctors, hospitals, etc., demanding information, observation, and high standards), and eventually even opening a women's clinic. We have, in effect, become a women's health collective.

Although we have found one supportive doctor, most physicians are threatened by this movement, and we see several reasons for it. First, of course, they are afraid we'll stop coming to them entirely and they'll no longer get our money. For the most part this isn't true, since one of the main results of self-health is that we get women who show some signs of abnormality to go to a doctor sooner than they might usually go, but equipped with more useful information than they might normally have. A woman in a recent self-health class (her first session) had what the more experienced women immediately felt to be an inflammation of the cervix (bright red instead of pink). She was being treated for a bladder infection by a doctor, but had not been examined internally. (Her medication was not reducing pain, incidentally). So with a sister for support, she went to her doctor again the following..."

ing day and told him about her  
self-examination,  
that what she had seen was a  
possible irritation of the cer-  
vix. He was freaked, but pro-  
ceeded to examine her and he  
was surprised (we weren't) to  
find that she did have “cervi-  
citis"" (any irritation of the  
cervix). This would have a  
large effect on the bladder in-  
fection or could be a sign of  
some more serious infection  
“such as gonorrhea. So although  
we cannot diagnose or prescribe,  
we teach each other awareness.  
There is a second reason we  
believe doctors are threatened.  
They need to maintain the eli-  
tist barrier between patient and  
physician and uphold their mys-  
tic powers. It is essential for  
them to hoard and guard their  
knowledge and to keep us ignor-  
ant. We've been told so many  
times ""it won't hurt"", ""you  
can't really feel that way"",  
""it's not serious"", etc. that we  
begin to doubt ourselves rather  
than the doctor. They see us  
gaining power over our lives;

This kind of paranoia clear-

When we begin questioning

us with force (i.e. arrest)

On January 22 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that in the first three months of pregnancy the decision of whether to have an abortion is between a woman and her doctor; in the next six months, the state may regulate the abortion procedure in ways that reasonably relate to maternal health. Only in the last 10 weeks may a state ban abortions except where they are necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.

The decision firmly recognizes a woman's right to control her own body as a part of her fundamental right to privacy, and was seen as a victory for the women's movement.

Not until March 5, however, did the Colorado Supreme Court, basing its ruling on the January decision, strike down the state abortion law's restrictions as unconstitutional. The Colorado law, which previously had been considered ""liberal,"" contained certain ""requirements"" which the U.S. Supreme Court specifically stated were unconstitutional, namely, 1) that there be a residency requirement; 2) that abortions be performed in hospitals accredited by a private agency; 3) that applicants be screened by a hospital committee; or 4) that independent doctors certify the potential dangers of a pregnancy to a woman's physical or mental health.

In addition, the Colorado decision guaranteed the civil rights of those hospital employees who refuse to participate in abortion procedures by stating that such refusal may not be a basis for any disciplinary action against that employee. The decision also stated that any hospital can refuse to admit a patient for an abortion.

Denver citizens demonstrate at a recent abortion rally.

According to members of the Mountain States Women's Abortion Coalition (MSWAC), which has been investigating the implementation of the new rulings in local hospitals, most hospitals are changing or have changed their procedures to comply with the ruling. Some of those hospitals providing abortions without restriction during the first trimester are General Rose, Beth Israel, Denver General, and Colorado General.

On March 12 the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling on the Illinois abortion law, and declaring it unconstitutional, concurrently issued an order that all state governments must comply with the original January decision and will no longer be allowed to procrastinate in creating new laws.

""One thing I'm worried about,"" said Nancy Stern, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, commenting on the January 22 decision, ""is that women will now say, ‘OK, it's all over. Now I can get an abortion if I want one and that's that.' But there's a real possibility that a state pressured by anti-abortion forces will pass abortion laws, under the guise of protecting a woman's health, which will actually succeed in restricting her right to an abortion.""

BMIR Editorial

by Bourge Miller

“While the January 22 Supreme Court decision concerning abortion brought welcome and hard-fought-for relief to millions of Americans, concerned women must face the reality that the decision is not at all the total victory sought in the fight to control our own reproductive lives. Rather, it is only the first step, although a very meaningful one, in that direction. The ruling has removed many barriers, but has left or erected others.

Some painful issues still pending and some points to be vitally aware of are these:

1) The ruling places no restrictions on abortion during the first trimester, except the requirement that it be performed by a licensed physician. However, beginning with the second trimester, states are still free to regulate abortion procedures ""in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health."" Legislative action in this area must be carefully monitored to ensure continued protection of our rights.

2) The Supreme Court ruling makes no reference to the age at which a woman may obtain an abortion. Legislation will most certainly take place in this area. Must our younger sisters still face the red tape of parental or spousal consent? Do these women not also have the right to privacy as guaranteed by the Constitution?

3) Although the high court has just recently issued an additional order directing states to bring themselves into full compliance with the new ruling, it is clear that some state legislatures, state attorneys general, hospitals, etc. will most certainly attempt to impede the implementation of the decision. Those in the abortion rights movement must continue to press for speedy implementation of the ruling until all have complied.

4) ""Right-to-Life"" forces have responded to the ruling with moralistic indignation and irrelevant appeals to emotionalism that do not deal with the constitutional issues at hand. They have also introduced two bills into Congress (See page 8 - this issue).

5) It is extremely important to note that the ruling leaves open a possibility of the passage of total repeal legislation either on the state or federal level. The abortion rights movement should press for the passage of the Abortion Rights Act of 1973 which would take the question of abortion out of the state criminal codes altogether.

With the above highlights of still existing problems in mind, it should be clear that the battle women have been fighting to gain full control of their own reproductive lives is far from over. Much still needs to be done to protect and ensure these rights for all women. The abortion movement is and will continue to be challenged on all fronts and at all levels. That challenge must be met with even greater efforts and determination than before.

Bourge Miller has been involved in the abortion movement for a year and a half. She was at one time active with MSWAC, and is vitally concerned with women's right to control their own bodies."

P.2. Since we last came to you, we
on the staff of BMR have under-
gone several changes. Some of
our members have gone, and new
women have joined us. The major-
ity of us were undergoing some
sort of personal upheaval or
other, and for a while the paper
seemed to have a low priority
for most of us. Couple that
with the organizational problems
of any new project-oriented
group, and you have it we were
getting bogged down.

We seemed to rally, however,
around the issue of our group
process. This carries a lot of
significance for us, because we
are determined to carry sister-
hood into the interactions of
our work group. The usual hier-
archy we confront in our jobs
and society as a whole disgusts
us — no person's potential is
highly utilized when orders are
handed down from the top. We
each see a lot of ourselves in
the paper, so there is an abun-
dance of creativity to tap. We
have struggled to find ways to
bring out each woman's unique
contribution.

The first major structural
decision we made was to split in-
to task groups: Ads & Distribu-
tion, Journalism, Photos & Graph-
ics, Layout and Communications.
In these smaller groups, we have
started seeking procedures which

will facilitate our interaction.
Some methods we have adopted
are choosing a woman by lot at
the beginning of one meeting to
chair the next so that she can
prepare an agenda and assure
continuity and follow-through of
our efforts, and choosing a
Process Observer, also by lot at
the beginning of each meeting,
to facilitate our evaluation of
our interaction. Interwoven
into these efforts is our own
commitment to each other, to
hear and to speak and to respond
to one another's feelings.

At present, it would be safe
to say that none of us is totally
satisfied with BIG MAMA RAG. We
continue to be excited about the
possibilities for Denver's first
women's journal, however, and we
have batted around numerous pro-
posals for upgrading BMR.

We are investigating means of
improving our appearance so that
we will have a more appealing for-
mat. We want to go to smaller
print throughout so that we can
widen the scope of our information
and carry more news — national,
local, international — and more
investigative journalism. This
would involve expanding our
journalism group, specifically
with part-time experienced women
writers, and would also include
publishing more often.

We have expanded sufficiently
to require office space and the
supplies that go with it, but to
date we do not have the money to
obtain such a luxury. This is
another area we are investigating.

We have discussed many times
the question of who we want BMR
to reach. Although we intended
the paper as a forum for any
woman to speak, we must concede
that through our choice of arti-
cles, we make the paper more than
a forum. We know that a woman
who has decided conclusively

where we’re at

against the liberation movement
will never open BMR, and we are

not missionaries trying to

change her.

But we do want to speak to
women who are beginning to feel
anger about the roles assigned
to them, to women who are be-
ginning to reach out for a new
grasp on themselves and for a
new communication with other
women. There are a lot of these
women whom BIG MAMA is not
reaching, and we are open for
suggestions as to solving this
dilemma. One thing that would
help is to know who we are
reaching, so please let us know
who you are.

About the only editorial
policy we have begun using so
far is that, while constructive
criticism of one another and
the women's movement is welcome,
anything that is downright des-
tructive or damaging to sister-
hood will not be printed. Fur-
ther, we are trying to come up
with some guidelines to use to
upgrade the quality of our
writing in general.

We are a strong group of
women, and we have begun an ex-
citing project, a chance to ex-
press ourselves and provide
Denver women with an invaluable
communications network. But we
have limited time and limited
resources (all of us work full-
or part-time at other jobs to
support ourselves and families).

We want to hear from you, and
we feel an absence of response.
We want your suggestions and
reactions on format, content,
style, whatever — and to a
large degree, the evolving
quality of BIG MAMA RAG depends
on it.

The Connection, an infor-

mation, referral, and
counseling center located at
the corner of 18th and Clarkson,
has been in operation for two
and one-half years. A staff
of two women and two men is
available from 9-9 Monday
through Friday.

Four of our services may
be of special interest to
women. First, among our job
listings are some openings
especially created for women.
If you have a skill and are
seeking employment call us at
892-1812. Second, we know of a
number of excellent feminist
counselors, some of whom will
take referrals from us on a
sliding-scale basis. Third,
we specialize in child
advocacy. This involves
working with juvenile offenders
and assisting them with legal
hassles and group home place-
ments. Lastly, problem
pregnancy counseling which
consists first, of helping
women decide among the available
options. If she chooses to have
a therapeutic abortion, we
refer her to trusted physicians
either in Denver or out-of-state.
One of our female staff
members accompanies her to a
Denver hospital if she has no
one else to be with. We have
never been unable to arrange
a legal abortion for a woman
with financial problems."

2seaged cry

In the summer of 1970, Ana Lou Coelho and her four

children left Oakland, California, to go camping on the
Yuba River outside of Grass Valley in Nevada County,

California.

“It was beautiful and we all loved being on the earth
again,” Ana said. “I asked the children if they'd like to
stay — and they said yes, so after spending most of the
summer there, we moved up permanently in Septem-
ber, 1970. I had wanted to get out of Oakland, and get
the children out of the city — so it seemed like a very
good thing. We were all really happy up there. . .”

One year later — on September 25, 1971, life changed
drastically for Ana and her children — Linda, 11; Sheri,
10; Rhonda, 14; and Ronnie, 7. On that day, Ana was
charged with second degree murder and held without
bail in Nevada County Jail. Her children were sent to
stay with their grandmother. She was charged with
killing a man she didn't know in a barroom brawl. The
man was stabbed to death. Ana had been wearing a
hunting knife in the bar the night of his death.

An all-white Nevada County jury found Ana guilty on
December 10, 1971. Ana has three Apache grand-
parents, and one Chicano grandparent.

We met in mid-February, 1972, 25 days after she had
been sentenced to life and transferred to the California
State Institution for Women at Frontera. She was CIW
number 8811.

Ana, five feet tall, her shiny black hair tied in braids on
each side of her small olive face, looked about 17 years
old instead of 32. She wore a prison uniform covered
by a beige prison jacket about three times too big for
her. Her room, small and bare except for bed, toilet,
sink and desk, was decorated with pictures of her chil-
dren. It was obvious that they were as much the focus
of her life in that small barren room as they had been in
their home on the Yuba River.

“I've never been in jail before and to be plunked down
in prison is so heavy,” she said, her hands shaking as she
fixed coffee for both of us in a small automatic pot.
“At times I get so close to losing my mind; I think I just
can’t take it. I’m here for a crime I didn’t commit. I
guess if I wasn’t innocent it wouldn't be so hard, but I
just can’t accept that I'm really here for something I
didn’t do. All during the trial I was optimistic because
I didn’t see how they could find me guilty of something
I didn’t do. Plus... the D.A. had about 30 witnesses
and they told 30 different stories.

“The only thing they all agree to was that I had a knife

I admitted having. I had my hunting knife strapped on
my side, and somebody took it away from me when a
big fight broke out. It turned into a brawl — like a
free-for-all with 15 or 20 people involved. At this point
I was shoved back up against the jukebox. It was like a
football huddle only everyone was swinging, including
myself. It was during this time the man was stabbed. I
had never even seen him until the pictures of him were
shown at the trial. I didn’t even know anyone had been
stabbed until I heard someone yell, ‘Someone’s been
stabbed.’ The crowd had already dispersed, and we
were standing outside when the police came. I was
standing with this friend and someone told the police
officer, ‘Arrest them two because someone’s been
stabbed and either one of them did it.’ The officer told
me to get in the car, which I did.”

Ana said she was wearing the knife because she was
planning to join her children and another family on a
camping trip when she left the bar.

“I always wore Levis, tee-shirt, and a hunting knife on
these camping trips,” she said. “The knife I used pri-
marily in the preparation of meals, making sandwiches,
cutting watermelon or cantaloupe — just general camping
uses. I used it to help skin a rattlesnake once, but I had
a hard time as the knife wasn’t very sharp.”

During the trial, one pathologist testified that it would
take an incredible amount of strength to inflict the
wound — because it penetrated every muscle and tough
tendon and clipped the man’s backbone. He was
slashed from his chest to his waist. Ana, whose first
arrest came with the death, weighs less than 100
pounds. Testimony was contradictory — and even
Ana’s lawyer, David Kogus of San Francisco, couldn't
believe that the jury found her guilty with such scant
evidence.

Although Ana maintained hope for her freedom to the
very end, she knew the odds were against her, just be-
cause of her ethnic background and the attitudes to-
wards her which came out on the front pages of the
local paper and in the courtroom.

“The witnesses were so hostile. And the jury seemed
disinterested. One lady knitted through the whole trial
and another one addressed Christmas cards. I guess
they were hostile, too. I wasn’t an active member of
the community. We lived three or four blocks out of
town. We had made friends with a family with seven
children and apparently the community didn’t like them
so, they were hostile to me because of our association
with them. I didn’t know how unpopular they were
until the trial. It was also against me that I’d been
divorced six years and I was on AFDC (welfare). All
kinds of negative points. Witnesses said they heard me
arguing and saying things in Mexican or Spanish, but I
can't neither speak Mexican nor Spanish, so whatever I
said was in English! It didn't matter to them that I
had been past president of the PTA in Alameda, or

active with the drug abuse council and the Alameda
City Council. None of these things were brought up in
the trial. They said I was on welfare, but they didn’t
say that I had been working with the social worker and
he was putting me on job training. I wanted clerical or
secretarial work, although I'd like to teach roller-ska-
ting. (Ana took third place in the National Roller
Skating Meet in 1956 in Richmond, Virginia, represent-
ing the Bay Area and California.)

“The jury was unbelievable,” her attorney said.

“They were so hostile to her; it was apparent from the
first. Ana was disliked in the area because she was close
to people in a motorcycle gang who had moved to Grass
Valley and terrorized the people. It's a conservative,
white, older community of people who had moved out
to Grass Valley to escape the cities themselves. I was
used to San Francisco juries, and I didn’t anticipate or
see what a small-time jury would be like. Ana had asked
me to get a change of venue and she was right, I should
have listened to her. I’ve been living with this case now
and it’s really rough. Ana has beautiful children, and
comes from a fine family. I feel so strongly about it I
don’t think I'd go back to Nevada County for another
trial.

Dear Mom,

I hope you can get here for

must be mean to keep

you in peace

Ronnie,

“There were allegedly two eyewitnesses, but they didn’t
seem like much to me. And I don’t think they’re worth
much ...so I would expect that eventually we'll get her
out on appeal. I’m confident we'll get her a new trial.
I just don’t know whether they’ll cut her loose or not. I
don’t know... I can only hope.

“I went to New York to talk to the guy who really did
it. But he’s too scared — he’s on parole — and not will-
ing to confess to anything, let alone open his mouth... 
so that’s not much help.”

“When I first got here,” Ana said, “I didn’t know any-
thing. Like the first day I went back to my room and it
was locked — I went up to the control desk and asked

if I could have a key to my door. She just looked at me
and said, ‘No, we don’t give keys.’ I said, ‘Well, how do
I get in?’ ‘Just tell us and we'll pop your door,’ the
officer said. I was so scared and ignorant of what I
could and couldn't do, I just stayed in my room that
first week and went so close to going out of my mind —
I was dangerously close to it. I knew I couldn’t stay.
But then I found out we could go out in the yard — plus
I found a copy of the rules and read them and knew
more what was going on.

“It's so hard to write to my kids — there’s nothing to
write but bad things. All I can tell them is someday
justice will be done. Ronnie said, ‘Those people must
be mean to keep you there,’ and I just told him, ‘They
can’t help it — they’re doing what the court ordered
them to do. It’s hard for them to understand — I'm
innocent, yet I’m being punished for it. It's hard for
me to understand too — and I guess I never will accept
it. God knows I am innocent — and if I can just main-
tain my sanity, someday justice will be done. It has to
be. I can’t stand not being with my children.”

My name is Ana Lou Coelho #8811, my
story appeared in your April 1972, Volume II,
Number 8 edition of Off Our Backs.

On the 25th of this month it will be one
year that I have been unjustly incarcerated
for a crime which I DID NOT COMMIT!

I did not receive a fair trial and it
took the jury less than 15 minutes to reach a
guilty verdict. The charge is 2nd degree mur-
der. My conscience is clear and in my heart
I know that I am not guilty of this crime, but
that is of little help as long as I am being
held prisoner of the State of California. My
appeal was heard on August 15th in Sacramento,
California.

What I need is financial help, from any-
one who is willing to contribute. I need
enough money to cover an Appeal Bond, so that
I can be cut loose. The Cut Ana Loose Fund
(C.A.L.F.) has been set up by my mom, but so
far it hasn't been too successful, therefore
I am asking anyone and everyone who is able
and who cares to please donate whatever you
can to the fund. Donations may be sent dir-
ectly to my mom: Rose Spanyard, 1557 79th
Ave. Oakland, California, 94621.

I'm sure that there are other counties,
like Nevada County, in which there is no
justice and its theme song should be “I've
Been Working on the Railroad.” These coun-
ties should be exposed for what they are doing
to innocent people. Everyone, including the
jury, judge, D.A., police and Public Defender
are either related or know each
other very well. And it doesn't matter whether
you are guilty or not, if they want to prose-
cute you they will do it and especially if you
are unliked and not white and an outsider.

For these three reasons and only for these
three reasons, I am a prisoner of the State
in the only Women's Prison in California.

I am asking for your help and anything
you can do will be deeply appreciated by me
and my family.

Thank You Sincerely,

Ana Coelho #8811

Carolyn Agosta ff  

DIALECTIC OF SEX, by  
Shulamith Firestone  

Shulamith Firestone was born  
in Ottawa, Canada. She atten-  
ded several universities in  
the U.S. and earned a Bachelor  
of Fine Arts in Painting.  

She is presently editor of  
""Notes,"" a journal of radical  
feminism.  

In Dialectic of Sex, Ms.  
Firestone presents a clear  
idea of the women's movement.  
She replaces the myths and  
fears surrounding feminism with  
reasoning and understanding.  
She brings an awareness of the  
way in which each of us is  
being destroyed by our society.  
Further, she explains how  
women and men can only  
develop half of themselves at  
the expense of the other half.  
The myth has always been that  
the two sexes complement each  
other's abilities and personal-  
ity. But women and men are  
whole complete beings within  
themselves. So what part of  
our roles is a result of  
socializing and what part is  
biological? Or is any of it  
biological? Or is all of it  
socializing?  

The love-myth is destroyed  
in Ms. Firestone's explanation  
of the selfishness involved in  
a relationship...possessiveness,  
envy, jealousy, the obvious  
importance of physical beauty  
(make-up, clothes, hair.) The  
games we play; she bolstering  
his ego, he ""protecting"" and  
""defending"" her, way up there  
on her pedestal; she being  
""delicate"" and ""feminine;"" he  
being “strong"" and a ""real  
man.""  

In relating feminism and  
Freud, Ms. Firestone points  
out Freud's greatest  
failing, that of questioning  
the individual, rather than  
society as a whole as the cause  
for so-called ""maladjustment.""  
‘Feminism and Freudianism  
arose at about the same period  
of time; but Freud was  
accepted as the ""lesser of two  
evils,"" even though his  
theory is full of contradic-  
tions.  

Shulamith Firestone  
discusses and breaks down the  
entire theory of the family  
structure: father as bread-  
winner, mother as nursemaid  
and somewhat dependent upon  
the father, and ""children,""  
hopelessly dependent upon  
mother and father.  

This book is recommended to  
anyone feeling and seeing the  
Oppression of our society,  
whether woman, man, black,  
red, yellow, white.  

Next hearing date in ESTHER GOOD-  
YEAR vs. GATES RUBBER is March 28 at  
8:30 a.m. in Judge Finesilver's  

court on 2nd floor of courthouse at  
19th and Stout. Supportive women  
please attend.  

(CPS) At the end of 1972, suppor-  
ters of the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA) felt certain of imminent vic-  
tory. Now, three months later,  
massive anti-Equal Rights Amendment  
forces (Stop the ERA) have organized  
in an effort which puts easy and  
immediate ratification of the 26th  
Amendment in serious doubt.  

Early last year, Congress passed  
the Equal Rights Amendment, which  
would outlaw all forms of sex dis-  
crimination that are based on law  
or governmental action. It is nec-  
essary for 38 state legislatures to  
ratify the amendment. To date, 28  
states have ratified the ERA, 11  
have defeated it, leaving 11 states  
undecided. Ten of those 11 states  
must ratify the ERA for it to pass  
this year.  

Opponents of the Equal Rights  
Amendment make two main objections  
to its ratification. They claim  
that passage of the ERA would make  
women eligible for the draft, and  
that it would release men from their  
obligations to support a family.  

Jacqueline G. Gutwillig, chair-  
woman of the Citizen's Advisory  
Council on the Status of Women,  
labelled opponents' arguments irrele-  
vant. She commented that if a  
draft is reactivated, ""It would  
only be in a serious national emer-  
gency that would undoubtedly expose  
women to dangers as great as combat--  
and most women would want to defend  
their country in such circumstances.""  

As for the opponents' second ar-  
gument, releasing men from financial  
responsibility of their family,  
Gutwillig explained that a court  
never intervenes in a stable family  
situation. Therefore, families  
would continue to make individual  
and personal decisions affecting the  
their lives. In cases of separation  
or divorce, according to Gutwillig,  
the court would take into considera-  
tion the economic situations of both  
husband and wife before granting any  
financial settlements.  

As organized opposition grows  
stronger, supporters of the ERA ner-  
vously turn to a grassroots cam-  
paign in the remaining states in  
order to ensure a ratification, al-  
though undoubtedly a very narrow  
one, of the amendment which will fi-  

nally give women equal rights under  
law.  

Women in Colorado, which has al-  
ready ratified the ERA, who are in-  
terested in supporting its ratifica-  
tion in other states should send do-  
nations to: NOW Emergency Fund,

Colorado Cases  

JANET BONNEMA vs.  
STATE HIGHWAY DEPT.  

Charge: A job appointment  
was revoked when sex of appli-  
cant was learned, even though  
she was the most qualified appli-  
cant. State Court settlement  
reinstated her at job at  
Straight Creek Tunnel with back  
pay. Federal Court settlement  
awarded her attorney fees,  
$6750 cash settlement, and per-  
mission to do job-related  
duties formerly denied because  
of sex. Sandra Rothenberg was  
attorney for this case, consi-  
dered a landmark in the U.S.  
for breaking down ancient pre-  
judice against women in mines  
or tunnels.  

MARIANNE TAYLOR vs.  
MOUNTAIN ELECTRIC COMPANY  

Charge: Discharge and re-  
placement by a man, even though  
work was satisfactory. Ms.  
Taylor lost case, largely be-  
cause it was a fairly old case  
and witnesses were difficult to  
produce.  

PATTY HODGINS vs.  
BOULDER DAILY CAMERA  

Charges: Job discrimination  
on basis of sex, particularly  
in work assignment. Hearing  
Examiner did find that the  
Camera had committed sex dis-  
crimination, but not against  
Ms. Hodgins.  

MAUREEN TESLER vs.  
COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 12  

Charges: Discharge due to  
pregnancy, and discrimination  
based on religious creed.  
Hearing Examiner found in her  
favor. Commissioners haven't  
rendered a decision.  

JUNE FIELD vs.  
MONTROSE SCHOOL BOARD  

Charges: Employment as busi-  
ness teacher denied because her  
husband was already employed by  
the district and because dis-  

trict wanted business teacher to  
be part-time coach. Case in  

progress.  

VALERY McALLISTER vs.  
DEPT. OF JUVENILE PAROLE  

Charge: Discharge on basis  
of sex. Discrimination in job  
assignment on basis of sex.  
State District Court found in  
her favor, but Parole has  
attempted to reverse decision.

It's not nice to fool Mother Nature!  
(Chiffon Margarine ad)  
STATES  

I've always thought that the appear-  
ances of W.I.T.C.H. (Women's Inter-  
national Terrorist Conspiracy From  
Hell) was one of the cleverer early  
WLM yippie tactics. And since like  
many of my sisters I'm curious about  
witches, I decided to do a little  
research on the history of women  
and witchcraft for this month's issue  
of Big Mama Rag. One place to start  
such a search is with the late medie-  
val witch craze.  

The European witch craze was start-  
ling in its dimensions. Starting in  
Germany, Italy and other countries  
in the 14th century, it spread to  
France and England in the 16th cen-  
tury. Thousands upon thousands of  
people were killed—usually burned at  
the stake. One writer estimated that  
in certain German cities, there were  
an average of six hundred ""witches""  
put to death a year. ""Nine hundred  
witches were destroyed in a single  
year in the Wertzberg area, and a  
thousand in and around Como. At  
Toulouse four hundred were put to  
death in a day. In the Bishopric  

of Trier, in 1585, two villages  
were left with only one female in-  
habitant each."" And this mass  
hysteria was no delusion of the un-  
educated poor. Belief in witches  
was nearly universal, even among  

the emerging scientific community.  
Most important, it had the active  
support of the all-powerful Church,  

“Christianity or dreams”  

If it is true as some have suggested,  
that witchcraft represented surfac-  
ing of an older pre-Christian cult in  
which women played a major role, you  
would expect the Church to feel very  
threatened by it. Oddly enough the  
Church had through most of its his-  
tory officially considered the tra-  
ditional powers of witches—casting  

spells, turning themselves into ani-  
mals and so on—as the products of  
insanity or dreams. What changed  
the Church's mind is not clear. We  
do know that by the end of the 14th  
century pressures that would lead  

to the Reformation were mounting.  
For whatever reason, by the 15th  

century, the Church had decided that  

witchcraft was a threat to orthodoxy.  
By the end of the century the Pope,  
Innocent VIII, was issuing papal  
bulls, empowering his representa-  
tives to try witches.  

One of his representatives, Jacob  
Springer and Heinrich Kramer, sent  
to try witches in Germany, produced  
Christendom's guide on the theory  
and identification of witches, Mal-  
leus Maleficarum or Hammer of Witches.  
As you can see from the passage  
quoted at the beginning of this  
article, these two were obsessed with  
the witch's sexuality, especially  
the sexuality of the female witches.  
(Was celibacy getting to them?)  

The book also noted witches’ healing  
powers and warned of their knowledge  
of contraception and abortion proce-  
dures.  

Changing men into beasts  
""Now there are, as it is said in the  
Papal Bull, seven methods by which  
they infect with witchcraft the  
venereal act and the conception of  
the womb: First, by inclining the  
minds of men to inordinate passion;  
second, by obstructing their genera-  
tive force; third, by removing the  
members accommodated to that act;  
fourth, by changing men into beasts  
by their magic act; fifth, by de-  
stroying the generative force in  
women; sixth, by procuring abortion;  
seventh, by offering children to the  
devils, besides other animals and  
the fruits of the earth with which  
they work harm.""  

Terrifying as these powers were, I  
wonder if women saw all of them in  
quite the same evil light that the  
two priests did.  

The persecution of witches in this  
country has a short and a somewhat  
less sordid history. The first  

witchcraft trial in the English colo-  

nies for which we have records, oc-  
curred in Windsor, Connecticut in  
1647. During the next fifty years,  
there were a total of about one  
hundred cases out of which thirty-  
eight persons were convicted and  
hanged (not burned). The notorious  
Salem witch trials were different  
from the earlier ones. Occurring at  
the tail end of the witch craze in  
Europe they were examples not of  
isolated accusations and trials, but  
of mass hysteria in a backwater New  
England village. Early in 1692, a  
group of girls age 9 through 19  
accused a woman slave, Tituba, and  
two elderly poor women of having  
bewitched them, causing them to jerk  
and shriek. The slave was beaten in-  
to confession by her master. Those  
accused began to implicate others  
and confess to broomstick rides,  
witches' sabbaths, copulation with  
the devil and so on. By May when  
the governor arrived from Boston,  
several dozen accused witches were  
awaiting trial. The governor ap-  

pointed a special court of laymen  
to try the accused.  

‘Overwhelming’ evidence  

Records still exist of those trials.  
Take for example, the trial of one  
Susanna Martin. The evidence against  
Mistress Martin was overwhelming.  

Her fellow townsman, Bernard Eache,  
testified that:  

""...being in bed on a Lord's Day  
night, he heard a scrambling at the  
window, whereat he then saw Susan-  
na Martin come in and jump down upon  
the floor. She took hold of this  
deponent's feet, and drawing his body  
up unto a heap, she lay upon him  
near two hours; in all which time he  
could neither speak nor stir.""  

Another Salem resident, Robert Dow-  
ner, accused Mistress Martin of witch-  
craft and the following night:  

“as he lay in his bed, there came  
in at the window the likeness of a  
cat, which flew upon him, took  
fast hold of his throat, lay on him  
a considerable while, and almost  
killed him.""  

And one William Brown further testi-  
fied that Susanna often appeared  
to his wife:  

""giving her no little trouble;  
and when she did come, she was  
visited with birds that sorely  
pecked and pricked her; and some-  
times a bunch, like a pullet's egg,  
would rise in her throat, ready to  
choke her...""  

Traditional witch's powers with sexu-  
al overtones. Susanna, as you might  
expect, was found guilty and exe-  
cuted. When the Salem court ad-  
journed, some nineteen or twenty  
persons, mostly women, and two dogs,  
sex unclear, had been hanged.  

Why always women?  

The events in Salem Village have been  
attributed to any number of causes,  
""exhibitionism natural to young  
girls,"" the evils of Puritanism,  
the sociology of a small back-  
water village. But the question  

that interests me is not why witch-  
craft crazes, but why, throughout  
Western history, have the accused  
usually been women?  

To answer that question we have to go  
back, long before the Christian era.  
It is as if men have always seen  
women as a split person. From the  
earliest pre-history when the ferti-  
lity goddess was divided into the  
beneficent great mother and the  

dark, sexually dangerous earth mo-"

Polly Pavek

Two months ago I discovered  
that I love to sing. I have  
been singing for many years;  
when I'm alone, in the bath-  
tub, washing dishes, riding  
in the car, and sometimes I  
sing with friends. I used to  
sing only folk songs, but in  
my recent discovery I  
started to explore rock 'n  
roll, and I try to sing along with  
Aretha, or Bonnie Bramlett,  
Laura Nyro, Carole King,  
Bonnie Raitt, Merry Clayton,  
or Rita Coolidge. These  
women sing about themselves  
(ourselves) with such energy  
in their voices, and strength  
in their souls that they  
have fully converted me to  
singing my own soul. I have  
expanded my singing territory  
from the bathtub, kitchen  
sink, and moving car to the  
sidewalks, the city park, my  
job, and as far as an actual  
live microphone. The less shy  
and fearful I am of public  
places hearing my voice, the  
less fearful I am of myself,  
and I feel like I'm breaking a  
link of the patriarchal chain  
that keeps me from my own free-  
dom.

Now that I enjoy singing so  
much, I want to do something  
with it. I have gone to many  
auditions and met quite a few  
people. Every group I've  
visited has been dominated by  
men, whether they sing folk or  
cock rock. I've met three  
women and about fifteen men at  
various auditions. I also  
discovered that the majority  
of vocal try-outs for rock 'n  
roll bands have been men.

I've wondered about the minor-  
ity of women dealing with  
popular music: is it because  
women hate cock rock, or  
that we can't sing, or that  
we can sing but are too shy in  
the mask of Eve to assert  
ourselves? Personally, I  
despise cock rock and refuse  
to sing or listen to it (which  
presents many problems).  
Luckily I can sing, and I am  
bored hiding out in the bath-  
tub.

One of the three women I  
met was fired from the group  
she had been with because  
she wouldn't cut her hair in  
a shag style, nor wear tinted  
glasses and batty eyelashes.  
The second woman looked like  
Janis Joplin and sang a lot  
of cock 'n roll which pleased  
all the men in the band. The  
third woman is a very versatile  
musician who left a group  
after a month of their pelvic

ego trips. God's death:  
Why do we have to be subjugated  
by electric penises that glory  
in the enslavement of women?

I want to sing with good,  
rhythmic music that comes  
from my womanly soul. I am  
trying to move forward as a  
singer and as a woman; I'm  
practicing and strengthening  
my voice, and just about  
praying that I'll find some  
musicians who won't oppress  
me.

The only people I know  
who don't oppress me are my  
sisters. Yes, I want to sing  
with my sisters. I just drool  
at the image of being on  
stage with women, good music,  
and a happy audience before  
us. I smile with deep pleasure  
as my fantasy grows and there  
are only women on stage at  
Mr. Lucky's and all the women  
working there, who are  
pushed into hot pants by the  
management and eagle-eyed by  
the many heavy-set, American  
flagged bouncers, join them  
and are freed from the ass-  
pinching customers, and then:  
all those women go over to  
the Warehouse and tear down  
all those pictures on the walls,  
because every one of those  
drawings or paintings are of  
nude women. And who knows,  
Tricky Dicky's might even be  
invaded!

Oh, I'm tired of the bathtub,  
it depresses me. I'm sick of  
loud cock rock, it's trying to  
kill me. I want to sing and  
be heard. I know that there  

are many women in Denver who  
can sing, and many women who  
are good musicians. The  

men dominating the music  

world will only allow our songs  
and creativity to develop to  

a limited point where we  
threaten them with real and  
better music, and they will try  
to stop us. Boycott them!

And let's get ourselves together.

Mother Nature is good; she gives

Woman was either the sexless angel

can novelists for two hundred  
years has been the juxtaposition  

of the snow maiden and the dark  
lady. Nathaniel Hawthorne, author  
of the Scarlet Letter, is typical  

in his use of the contrasting  
images. In his Blithedale Romance  
he juxtaposed the dark-haired, sen-  
sual Zenobia (probably modeled on  
Margaret Fuller, an early feminist)  
and the frail blond Priscilla,  

who is Philip Wylie's or Philip  
Roth's ""Mom"" if not the dangerous  
woman in a new guise, emasculating  
her male children as did the ""vagina

of earlier myths. Woman is the  
incomprehensible ""Other,"" angel-

I must admit, though, I  
am at times envious of the witch's

In this article I have made exten-  
sive use of a very interesting new  
pamphlet by Barbara Ehrenreich and  
Deirdre English, ""Witches, Midwives,  
and Nurses, A History of Women  
Healers."" It is available at the new  
women's bookstore, The Woman's  
Voice, 673 South Pearl. I have also  
relied on papers written by two of  
my women's history students, Judy  
Matchett's ""Momism: From Philip  
Wylie to Philip Roth” and Dorothy  
Kiernan's, ""Witchcraft: The Role  

of Women in the Witch Craze of the  
16th and 17th Centuries."" Margaret  
Murray in her The God of the Witches  
discusses European witchcraft as  

an ancient, indigenous cult. Norman  
Cohn in the Pursuit of the Millen-  
nium discusses the bizarre sects  

of Medieval Europe. Malleus Male-  
ficarum is in paper. There are  
many histories of witchcraft in the  
English colonies including among  

the most recent, Marion L. Starkey's  
The Devil in Massachusetts and  
Chadwick Hansen, Witchcraft at  
Salem. The theme of the evil  

woman is explained in detail in H.R.  
Hay's The Dangerous Sex. Last, the  
YSA posters of famous women in histo-  
ry that I mentioned in my last  
article are available at the Women's  
Voice.

BigMammaRag,1,3,,9,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No3_page009.txt,"WOMEN'S RIGHTS BY LAW —— the 19th step forward?

The law functions as the skeleton  
of our society. It holds deeply  
rooted mores, prejudices and beliefs  
in a coherent structure.

A revision of the law almost nev-  
er precedes a recognized and strong  
movement manifesting a change in our  
system of values, but rather follows  
such a change. Even when altera-  
tions are made in the laws, if the  
social movement that caused the  
change was not broad enough or deep  
enough, then the new or amended law  
will have little effect. It will be  
ignored or interpreted so strictly  
by the courts that its range becomes  
extremely narrow and thus its power  
negligible.

Two examples of the above would  
be the Fourteenth Amendment of the  
United States Constitution (Equal  
Rights Under the Law) and the Nine-  
teenth Amendment (Giving Women the  
Right To Vote).

The Fourteenth Amendment was  
passed shortly after the Civil War  
and for many years was interpreted  
to apply only to discrimination in-  
volving Blacks. It took decades be-  
fore the U.S. Courts began applying  
the 14th Amendment to any irrational  
discrimination against recognizable  
groups within our society.

After the passage of the 19th  
Amendment giving women the right to  
vote, the women's suffrage movement  
seemed to slowly come to a standstill  
for many years. Women did indeed  
vote, but as far as the law was con-  
cerned, that was about the only  
change for women.

The Justices sitting on our high-  
est Court through their decisions  
over the past century reflected what  
was the predominant attitude in our  
society about a ""woman's place.""

Around 1872, Mrs. Bradwell wanted  
to become a lawyer in the State of  
Illinois. The Illinois Bar Associa-  
tion said no. She appealed and the  
case was decided by the United States  
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court up-  
held the Illinois Bar Association.  
The Court said through Justice Bradley:

""Man is, or should be, woman's  
protector and defender. The natu-  
ral and proper timidity and deli-  
cacy which belongs to the female  
sex evidently unfits it for many  
of the occupations of civil life.

The constitution of the family or-  
ganizations, which is founded in  
the divine ordinance, as well as  
in the nature of things, indicates  
the domestic sphere as that which  
properly belongs to the domain and  
functions of womanhood. The har-  
mony, not to say identity, of in-  
terests and views, which belong,  
or should belong, to the family  
institution is repugnant to the  
idea of a woman adopting a dis-  
tinct and independent career from  
that of her husband.""

The actual legal basis for the  
decision was based upon a married wo-  
man's inability to make and enforce  
contracts. Only her husband could do  
that. Therefore the court was wor-  
ried about how a married woman could  
effectively contract with and for her  
clients.

The Court went on to say: ""The  
paramount destiny and mission of  
woman are to fulfill the noble be-  
nign offices of wife and mother.  
This is the law of the Creator.""

It is ironic to discover how the  
protective laws for women were ap-  
proved by the U.S. Supreme Court.  
The approval of such laws was con-  
sidered to be a step in the right di-  
rection for the labor movement.

In 1905 New York had in effect a  
law applying to both men and women  
which stated that no worker could be  
required to work in a bakery more  
than 60 hours a week or 10 a day.  
That law was challenged and struck  
down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The  
law in so far as it concerned men was  
unconstitutional as a violation of  
the right to contract and due process.  
Note that the law was unconstitutional  
only as to men. The door was left  
open.

In approximately 1908 the Oregon  
Legislature passed a law limiting the  
hours a woman could work in a factory  
to 10 a day. The law was challenged,  
but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld  
the law and stated in part:

""The two sexes differ in struc-  
ture of body, in the functions to  
be performed by each, in the amount  
of physical strength, in the capa-  
city for long-continued labor, par-  
ticularly when done standing, the  
influence of vigorous health upon  
the future well-being of the race,  
the self-reliance which enables  
one to assert full rights, and in  
the capacity to maintain the  
struggle for subsistence. This  
difference justifies a difference  
in legislation, and upholds that  
which is designed to compensate  
for some of the burdens which rest  
upon her.”

The critical language in this case  
(Muller vs. Oregon) follows:  
""...Though limitations upon per-  
sonal and contractual rights may  
be removed by legislation, there  
is that in her disposition and  
habits of life which will operate  
against a full assertion of those  
rights....Differentiated by these  
matters from the other sex, she is  

by Kathy Bonham

properly placed in a class by her-  
self, and legislation designed for  
her protection may be sustained,  
even when like legislation is not  
necessary for men, and could not  
be sustained.""

This language has been used up to  
the present time to justify a legal  
double standard for men and women.  
Thus sex became a valid basis for  
classification and a valid basis for  
differentiation.

Protective laws sprang up in every  
state ""protecting"" women from long  
hours, from lifting heavy weights and  
from such things as going into mines  
and so forth. In the first case,  
Bradwell vs. Illinois, the Fourteenth  
Amendment equal protection argument  
was not even raised.

The entire concept brought over to  
this country from England of women  
as chattels (personal property) be-  
longing either to their fathers or  
their husbands was enhanced by such  
decisions handed down by our high  
court. Up until the last decade or  
so, women in almost all states suf-  
fered from legal disabilities such as  
the right to contract by herself,  
the right to have certain kinds of em-  
ployment, the right to control her  
property or indeed even to have pro-  
perty, the right to go into business  
on her own, the right to be on a  
jury and on and on.

Women and children and idiots have  
been treated in very much the same  
way in our laws. The basis of the  
theory behind this grouping is that  
women, children and idiots must be  
protected and special attention must  
be paid to them. This attitude has  
brought some curious results.

For instance, many states up until  
a decade ago had special sentencing  
arrangements for women. The laws of  
a particular state would set forth  
the minimum and maximum sentence that  
one could be given for being convicted  
of a particular crime. An example  
would be 4 to 15 years.

All of this was done in the name  
of helping the woman, just as many  
of our laws regarding the insane and  
juveniles are made for protection  
but more often than not result in  
far greater harshness than a ""normal""  
man would receive from a standard  
sentence for the same or a worse  
crime.

Most of these kinds of laws re-  
garding sentencing of women have  
been repealed or held unconstitution-  
al in recent years. The 14th Amend-  
ment has been the primary vehicle  
for such declaration of unconstitu-  
tionality.

The part the law has played in  
maintaining much of the myth and  
prejudice about women is considerable,  
complex and revealing. The above  
barely touches upon the meat of the  
subject.

How our society finally reached  
the point of passing an Equal Rights  
Amendment for women and just what if  
anything that Amendment will do is  
an interesting investigation and a  
lengthy one.

BigMammaRag,1,3,,10,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No3_page010.txt,"WOMEN'S POLITICAL CAUCUS

The Colorado Women's Political Caucus (CWPC) meetings Sat. March 10 at Temple Square seemed on the surface to be a dull affair. Not only was the meeting strong-armed by a presiding officer and a parliamentarian, but the agenda included such exhilarating topics as the budget and by-laws!

But tucked away in the back pages of CWPC's rulebook are some exciting concepts, to-wit:

1. U.S. women have held more than 70% of the delegate positions at the precinct convention level and less than 4% at the state level, which means that women have had the deciding vote in electing men to represent them. A little political consciousness raising is in order here!

2. Women are beginning to recognize themselves as a voting block transcending traditional party affiliations. To quote Republican State Rep. Carol Tempest, the same people voted for her that voted for Democrat Pat Schroeder.

3. To organize a self-conscious women's vote is to give women power. It's a lot easier to negotiate when you can say with credibility, ""There are 40,000 voting women waiting to hear your decision.”

A conversation with outgoing CWPC chairperson Mary Ellen Gallagher revealed that CWPC is just getting firmly on its feet as a non-partisan women's caucus. Last year during election efforts, separate caucuses formed inside each party, with the Democrats' CWPC emerging as the strongest. (50% of Colorado’s delegates to the national Democratic convention were women.)

When the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) convened in Houston last February, two groups attended from Colorado, the Democratic caucus and the non-partisan caucus. Since that time, much has gone on behind the scenes to resolve the problem of party co-existence within the Colorado caucus to make it an organization that any woman - Republican, Democrat, or Independent -- would feel comfortable in. Some of the tedium evident at Saturday's meeting was directly related to such efforts, Ms. Gallagher said.

In reference to NWPC's convention, she cited as ""frustrating” the fact that there was “absolutely no parliamentary procedure."" The assembly spent four hours trying to resolve a very minor detail, she said. However, out of the chaos, women gained new confidence in themselves. ""You'd hear someone speaking who didn't know a whole lot more than you did, and the next thing you knew, you'd be up there yourself having your say before the crowd.""

The ""superstars"" stayed in the background: women like Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, and Gloria Steinem made themselves available to the delegates, sharing their expertise, but they were deliberately low-key so that new leaders would emerge.

One inspiring element of the NWPC convention that Ms. Gallagher ""didn't anticipate"" was a ""sense of history,"" of being a part of a movement, not only in rhetoric but in actual, solid, practical fact.

Bringing that inspiration to the grassroots level involves a lot of hard work. Current priorities include: (1) expanding membership to establish a true power block; (2) getting women elected to all levels in government (""If you want girls in shop classes in high school, you'll get funds for the equipment a lot faster if there are women on the school board.""); and possibly (3) researching the effect on women of negative political maneuvers like Nixon's welfare cutbacks.

Ms. Gallagher, who is more comfortable herself outside the present political system, nevertheless believes that an organized women's effort utilizing present party structures is needed at this time. She pointed out that, although some feminists are “liberating themselves"" by creating autonomous lifestyles outside the system, there are many women oriented to traditional political structures for whom a women's caucus provides a first rallying point for feminist issues. Moreover, women of all political leanings -- inside and outside the system -- who realize the need to join with other women in a common effort look to the caucus for the necessary structure to make this realization a powerful reality.

A few facts: President of NWPC is Frances (Sissy) Farenthold of Texas. Newly elected CWPC officers are President Marye Scharf, Vice President Estelle Firkany, Secretary Marilynne Siggerstaff, and Treasurer Bonnie Andrikopoulos. CWPC's Board of Directors: Jean Bain, Mary Ellen Gallagher, Karen Paget, Lydia Pena, Cynthia Small, and Rory Zahorek. Membership mailing address: 560 Clarkson.

HB 1128. Discrimination in Housing. Senate State Affairs, expected from committee in April.  
SB 53. Child Care Guide- problem.  
HB 1258. Requesting $800,000 Child Care Appropriations. Being introduced by Rep. Chuck Howe.  

(Above information from Bonnie Andrikopoulos, NOW's lobbyist. There is also a bill being pursued by Rep. Carol Tempest to equalize legal contractual age, but its number was not available at this printing.)

U.S. LEGISLATION PENDING

There are two anti-abortion bills before the U.S. Congress at present - HJ 261 and HJ 284. Each bill would “Guarantee the right to life"" of the fetus. One states that it would guarantee this right “from the moment of conception,"" while the other says ""from conception."" Both bills must be defeated.

The Right-to-Life people are well organized, so we've got to get going. Write to every U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative, whether or not you are one of her/his constituents. Pat Schroeder says the Right-to-Life people have gained access to her office several times at night to leave an aborted fetus on her desk. She also said she has received over 2000 letters urging her support of these bills. As you can see, the Right-to-Life group will resort to any sort of emotionalism. We've got to make our position known to Congresswoman Schroeder and the others.

Dear Sisters:

The first two issues of  
“Big Mama Rag"" are fantastic!  
All of us “women"" are in  
desperate need of our own  
paper if for no other reason  
than to know that I am not  
the only one like me...and may-  
be I'm not “sick” after all...  
and hey, this is what I think  
or feel! Also the idea of  
“women"" defining and spelling  
our own name and on OUR OWN  
terms is really important!  
There was an article in the  
last issue which I would like  
to comment on...""Books for Kids?  
Careful Now..."" My only  
objection was in the terminology  
""Kids"" are People! Just like  
you and me, the only difference  
MAYBE is that they are a  
little shorter. They  
have been provided for,  
oppressed, controlled, shielded,  
protected too...""Watch what  
you say in front of the ‘children'!""  
They, like us, have not  
been allowed to BE, to THINK,  
to FEEL, to take their  
OWN LIVES INTO THEIR OWN HANDS!  
Just as I do not like, in  
fact REVOLT against being  
referred to in one of the many  
condescending terms used for  
woman (e.g. ""chick,"" ""broad,""  
""baby,"" ""honey"") I in turn  
will NOT use condescending terms  
towards my younger sisters and  
peers.  

We have to learn to respect  
each other as PEOPLE, no  
matter what age, race, sex.  
All oppressed persons MUST work  
together to change this system  
which tyrannizes us all!

In struggle,

Carolyn Agosta

to read Dialectic of Sex

LETTERS HOME TO  

MAMA  

I find the writing,  
printing, and graphics of the  
BMR all above average. Com-  
mendable. On the other hand  
I find your editorial somewhat  
unworthy of you. ""A woman  
(or a man) who is thinking for  
and about herself"" often  
develops into a selfish, small  
creature. I believe the level  
of vocabulary, attention to  
grammar, cubistic artwork,  
layout and printing of the Rag  
demonstrate the above average  
skills and education of your  
staff. If so, might you not  
ask yourselves why this out-  
pouring of effort in print,  
which you might well spend else-  
where in individual advancement?  
A labor of love? Pure altruism  
in favor of less privileged  
females? I doubt it.

More favored than the  
average U.S. woman, you  
nevertheless feel inadequate  
either to attempt high attain-  
ment in the admittedly unsatis-  
factory and male-dominated goal  
reward systems of American  
society, or to strike out on  
your own courses, securely  
tied to your egos as you  
cleave between the Scylla of  
irrelevance and the Charybdis  
of blank failure.

Are you not trying mainly  
to build up your own idea of  
your self-worth? May I suggest  
that this is a valid goal, and  
that the B.M.R. adopt an  
unwritten editorial policy of  
building the ego of many  
women up to the point equal to  
their abilities, a policy of  
encouraging women to reach  
their full potential in the  
intellectual and financial and  
artistic terms dictated by our  
society? Wouldn't this be a  
more positive approach than the  
somewhat narcissistic policies  
you advocate? (After all just  
how many women or men feel  
obliged ""to write about their  
feelings, ideas?"")

Such a policy as I suggest  
though would require discipline.  
You could not go spouting off  
about Pat Schroeder. Your  
interviewers would have to  
strive to ask her questions  
which bring out her sterling  
qualities, to draw out her  
motivations so other women  
might identify similar forces  

in themselves.  

BMR:  

Thanks for the copy of  
""Big Mama Rag."" I really  
appreciated it and best of  
luck to you and the paper.  

Pat Schroeder  

We were happy to see Den-  
ver's first television series  
produced specifically for and  
about women, Anatomy of Woman  
(KRMA Ch. 6) has stirred up a  
lot of feeling and opinion,  
both positive and negative.  
Most important is the fact that  
many women have cared deeply  
about this program and wanted  
it to speak for them.

We would like to hear your  
opinions and your suggestions  
for an upcoming article. It is  
our understanding that the show  
may be expanded into a nation-  
wide series, a prospect we look  
forward to with enthusiasm. If  
this should happen, additional  
funding would hopefully open the  
door for implementing any con-  
structive criticism we could  
generate.

So please think about it,  
and let us hear from you.

I would have to believe  

motherhood ... .«::  

Then one day I read ""The  
Politics of Housework,"" per-  
haps the most important article  
I've ever read. I suddenly  
had the following realization.  
David and I certainly shared  
the Amanda tasks but I was the  
one responsible for her. I  
was the one who thought  
of what to do and then delegated  
the responsibility. I  
knew when she was about to run  
out of clothes, when to change  
her crib sheet, and when to  
give the relief bottle of  
apple juice. And then I  
reevaluated our parenthood  
existence. We both uncon-  
sciously acted upon my ultimate  
responsibility for the house-  
work, and, later, for the child.  

Fights, misunderstanding  
and anger began, and was I  
alone. Here I was with what  
most people considered a  
model husband, and I had always  
felt lucky (read: superior).  
I had had talks the previous  
spring with a woman who, with  
her husband, had explicitly  
delegated jobs. I had felt  
David and I had a ""greater""  
mutual understanding and we  
didn't need such artificial job  
outlines. Our commitment to  
equality was enough. We  

started to assign specific jobs.  

But I resented that I was the  
one who always thought of what  
to do. We tried to change  
that, but I had been socialized  
well and so unfortunately, had  
David. Our struggles were  
those that many sisters have  
gone through about housework,  
but complicated by Amanda's  
total presence and dependence.  
Our struggles were really  
hard. They were our first ones  
specifically around women's  
issues, and a few words of  
awareness do not break up old  
patterns. The change is  
painful and scary when you feel  
like a fanatic unappreciative  
bitch - but compared to anyone  

else's situation I was lucky.  

My angry feelings turned  

inward, repressed and sometimes  
expressed to David, but to  
nobody else. I didn't want to  
admit failure. ""If it's so bad,  
why did you have a baby in the  
first place,"" I imagined  

others would say to me.  

I felt guilty for resenting  
David. I felt I should  
appreciate his helpfulness.  

I'm frankly not sure what he  
was feeling. Frustration, I  
imagine. Every time he turned  
around I had thought of a new  
task. Oh, those arguments  
about how much Amanda's room  
should be dusted! After all,  
we never dusted our room.  

But she's an infant, and the  
germs are out to get her. All  
should be sterile and as  

clean as the pictures in the  
books. I probably felt more  
should be done than was neces-  
sary; David, less than necessary.  

How could I complain when  
I lived in a commune and so  
rarely ever was home alone with  
Amanda? My housemates adored

Maria Troy is a would-be college teacher with an MA in English from the University of Colorado who can't find a job. She presently manages an apartment building, which gives her free time to pursue alternative educational situations, among other interests. Don't get me wrong. I am just like you. But when a society has become dehumanized, treating the symptoms just aggravates the disease. Want an easy outlet for frustrations? Blame it on the men. Blame it on the society that is run by men. But who has raised all the children and taught them the values of that society? That's more than half of the dirty work, right there. Men and women today are victims of a society we have been stupid enough to acquiesce to for too long. And now, do you think the truly vital business of the world is carried on in office buildings? Are we seeking equality so that we, too, can struggle with the avarice and the ulcers that plague Seventeenth Street? 

You say you used to be an oppressed sex object? But you gave all your frilly dresses to the Salvation Army? You burned your bra and now you scorn any woman who wears one? When an MCP whistles at you in the park, you flip him the bird? You're ashamed of having been Snowflake Queen in high school? When somebody calls you ""Miss Smith,"" you snap to attention, stick out your chin and thunder, ""That's MS Smith, buddy!""? 

You've come the wrong way. Ultimately, the issue is not a sexual one, nor is it a political one. The structure must be changed, but if the substance is not changed, the difference is irrelevant. We can win equality in the courts, but we can't legislate the human spirit. Where do we start? Not by pointing fingers there and there, but by recognizing our dignity and responsibilities as human beings. 

What about you? Are you your own oppressor? Do you blame your parents for the way you turned out? Do you blame society? Men? When are you going to start taking responsibility for the way you are? Have you got a chip on your shoulder? Will you be angry with me for saying that Women's Lib is a white, Baby.

It's all together crazy now

How much we've played the fools

The time we've spent “prettying up"" 
With silks and furs and jewels.

Faces plastered head to chin

And hands that squish of lanolin 
Tresses golden now are raven 
Appendages are glossily shaven. 

Sultry eyes of Maybelline 
FDS shouts ""I am clean"" 
Underarms are sprayed and dry 
Certs stops bad breath when I sigh. 

Diet pills or skipping meals 
No matter how the stomach feels 
Ought to mean a dress size eight 
For Friday's party looking great. 

Perfume's essence from Paris, France 
Could make the difference at a dance 
Even if your zits won't heal 
Use Ultra Brite with sex appeal. 

If your body is aching, groaning 
While the other YOU is angrily moaning. 
""Something here, it's just not right” 
Is this really ME going out tonight? 

It's nice to be the way you are 
And not the one from out of a jar 
Zits and bulges, mouse brown hair 
Expensive clothing that you wear 
Doesn't make you more aware 
Doesn't make your ""loved one” care. 

Since You Won't Know Any Other Way, Mister

I'm going to drill a screw through your temples 
Just so there's enough air for your brains to 
slide around in uncomfortably 

I'm going to drive a spike at the top of your head 
Just so there's hole enough for all the beautiful women 
of the world to stuff rags into 

It only stifles the inner glow 
So stand back sister, let it grow 

You'll like the feeling when you WANT TO JOIN A CONSCIOUSNESS- 
RAISING GROUP??? 

Enough I hope that you will share 
The knowledge that the “gimmick"" is done 
And the magnificent YOU has finally won

There is only one real  
change that can take place,  
and it is a change that takes  
place in each individual.  
There is a moral to be drawn  
here, even though morals have  
fallen from grace. It concerns  

the dignity of being a human  
being and how we should respect  
that dignity in others. It  

has been made a maxim in  

every great religion or  
philosophy that has ever lived.  
It begins,  

in the world. ""Do  

unto others...""  

ACTUAL SPEECH OF WOMEN'S  

I am not a liberated woman.  
I do not know of one woman in  
this world who is liberated -  
being female we are all equally  
subject to the same inherent  
evils in our everyday living  
situations. To believe that  
the freedom of women focuses on  
individual solutions to “our  
problems"" is just another rusty  
door which should've been  
kicked off its hinges by all  

of us years ago.  

When I walk down the street  
I am just as likely to be  
leered at, whistled at, or  
made the butt of some insensi-  
tive joke as my mother is, or  
my next-door neighbor, or the  
woman who works as a doctor  
or the one who performs  
janitorial services. When any  
woman applies for a job which  
has previously been held mainly  
by men, she is just as likely  
to be hassled about it whether  
she identifies with Margaret  
Mitchell or with Kate Millett.  
There are no individually free  
fish in an aquarium.  

No one today would think of  
telling a black person that her  
or his discrimination is an  
individual dilemma. ""Pull  
yourself up by your bootstraps""  
has pretty much been buried  
under the pile of old books  

where it belonged in the first  

place. It is also generally  
acknowledged that racism is  

the direct result of someone's  
huge obnoxious thumb being  
pressed down upon someone  
else's vulnerable if unwill-  
ing head.  

Yet as women we still fall  
into the trap that we are our  
own thumb-pressers, that the  
snapping of the strings  
which bind us can be accompli-  
shed with thousands of personal-  
ly monogrammed scissors,  
that the problem is ultimately  
one of ""human liberation"" (and  
look who's already ahead by  
the very nature of the word).  

The liberation of women  
does not mean exchanging  
female stereotypes for male  
stereotypes. We should not  
wish to adopt either the  
feminine or the masculine roles  
as they are presently conceived -  
Migrant Mary  
Homemaker vs. Mr. Ulcerated  

Maybe I Can Answer  

Mariame Waters  

Walter Wall Street. Further-  
more, the liberation of women  
does not mean that our publi-  
cations are similar to the  
male-dominated women's  
magazines - e.g. Family  
Runaround, Redneck Book,  
Cashmopolitan, Vague, Women‘s  
Daydreams, etc. Feminist  
publications do not seek to  
make ""women's place"" more  
comfortable and easy (e.g.  
how to scrub the floor in 5  
minutes instead of 25) but  
rather to question and explore  
the kinds of problems which  
affect all of us as women.  
Pointing the finger  
where it rightfully belongs is  
an extremely necessary first  
step for any second-class  
individual or group. The  
black person who was denied the  
bank presidency because of  
race is not individually  
responsible for that denial.  
The woman who was molested by  
her father as a child is not  
personally accountable for the  
confused way she may always  
view sexuality because of that  
molestation. The feminist who  
sees that she lives in a  
society so lop-sidedly in  
favor of the other sex that she  
is always looking up from the  
bottom of the see-saw must  
justifiably be angry with whom  
she sees sitting at the top.  
Nevertheless, this revela-  
tion is only a first step and  
we as women must constantly  
work together to carry over  

the realities of our political  
sexual, and economic (etc.)  

discoveries (and what are  
""human issues"" composed of  
after all?) into our everyday  
living situations. Only  

then can we begin to make a  
revolution with our lives.  

But by continuing to believe  
that every woman is personally  
accountable for the less-than-  
someone role that's always  
been thrust upon us we may all  
end up in the playground -  
together but alone at the  
bottom of our respective see-  
saws. There is a moral to be  
drawn here and while it may not  
be quite so old and venerated  
as some it is certainly as  
worthy. It begins, ""United  

we stand...""  

SUFFRAGE MEETING  
We will have what men have.  
It may not be much, but we mean to have  
it. If we cannot have it through our  
Organization, we will have it through our  

Combination, or without, if necessary. We  
refuse to be poked in the gallery any more,  
but insist on being placed on the floor of  
the House. That drunken loafer in the house  
says, “Down with the petticoats."" I say  
""Up with the petticoats and down with the  
pants."" Then things would be visible in their  
true light. We must get together; so who  
as long as  
women are split up as we are the men will  
always be on top.  

am I waiting for  
to “give"" me  
that moment? and pour out...

Motherhood continued here. The usual household tasks  

were now shared by five of us.  
‘How could I complain that David  

didn't read the childcare  
books? I remember pressuring  
him to read pages so and so,  
and he would, eventually.  
After all, he was working hard  
in school and I had none of  
those pressing commitments.  

(I was registered, but not a  
student in practice.)  

During Amanda's first four  
months I was involved with  
the Woman's Caucus of my  
graduate program. I had a  
dim realization that that con-  
tact was very important for my  
sanity. It was my only con-  
tact outside of my world of  
Amanda, David and the house.  
Winter quarter began and I  
took some classes. I clung to  
that identity and ego-tripped on  
the fact I technically never  
dropped out of school.  

I remember tripping on how  
atypical (read: superior) I  
was. A lot of my words to  
other people, especially women's  
liberation women, were partially  
to impress. I bragged about  
my negative fantasies of  
killing Amanda and didn't let  
myself feel many positive or  
""typical"" ones. I dug acting  
cool and indifferent - being  
a liberated mother. I dug  
nursing Amanda so casually and  
successfully. At the time I  
wasn't conscious of bragging.  

I did have fantasies of escape  
from this drama, of feeling it  
was all a temporary game.  

After all, we hadn't established  
any mutual love relationship.  

I knew it didn’t matter to  
Amanda who was holding her, but  
she did prefer my lactating  
breasts to the bottle. As we  
got into a routine, David and I  
could talk and reflect, as op-  

posed to react, more. I  

resented doing more than my  
exact time allotted share of  
baby care and kept keen watch  
on the division of labor.  

When I wrote some papers for  
school and David seemed willing  
to do more than his share, I  
was amazed and guilty because  
I knew I wasn't willing to  

do the same for him. God, I  
thought I was selfish, but I  
kept my principles because I  
felt a vague, unspoken support  
from some women in my life.  

I was angry and jealous  
of David. He not only had  
the rewards of parenthood, he  
had work he could relate to.  
One reason I nursed as long as  
I did was to keep myself as  
Amanda's most special person.  
It was also difficult to  
share the one area of compe-  
tence I felt I had. Once  
Amanda fell off the bed while  
David was in the room with her.  
One of my gut reactions was it  
wouldn't have happened if I  
had been there. I rushed in  
when David called for me and  
silently felt, I can comfort  
her better than anyone.  

After all, if she prefers  
David, what else do I have?  

I felt very rigid about  
equalization of Amanda's respon-  
sibilities. Because I didn't  
have anything else satisfying  
of my own, and because of a  
guilt about what kind of mother  
I am, I'd slip into doing more  
than my share.  

David didn't feel as  
isolated or have the desperate  
desire to talk about everyday,  

issues of baby care. One  
reason he didn't was that being  
a father was another something  
he did, not something he ""was.""  
Being a mother was who I was.  
Somewhere in me I felt  
unrecognized, David was the  
focus of attention by being  
so nice and so responsible for  
his child. “Oh, Alice, he is  
amazing and you're so lucky  
because most men don't have  
that special feeling and intui-  
tion for babies,"" said my  
mother and her friends. He  
got the public accolades from  
me and my friends as well, for  
what was expected from me.  
Again I was being defined  
in terms of a man. People  
looked at us and said how  
lucky I was to have David around.  
It still makes me angry when  
I think about it because it's  
still going on.  

David realized that he re-  
lated to a lot of taking care  
of Amanda in terms of a burden.  
I felt the same way. David  
and I are in a world of child-  
less graduate students and I  
was jealous of them and  
embarrassed to say so because  
I would make public my help-  
lessness and sense of failure.  
I feel guilty even in writing  
this today because I am think-  
ing ""what does this say about  
my getting into the joys of  
motherhood?"" Those moments of  
joy were there, but they were  
never long lasting.  

Somewhere in me I feel  
Amanda is cheated - to have a  
mother who is so totally ambi-  
valent, who finds her boring  
in long stretches of hours,  
who resents her constant deman-  
ding dependence. When I  
viewed her as an object to be  
responsible for, my negative  
feelings and fantasies rushed  
in. When I'm taking care of  
her it’s either her trip or  
ours together. Perhaps I can  
read something light or listen  
to music, but there's no way  
I can be into anything or any-  
body else in a deep way.  

What about any positive  
feelings? Sometimes they come  
out of guilt, when I'm wishing  
I was away from her. It  
seemed like I was always schem-  
ing to get away from her. Then  
I realize she herself is really  
cute and innocent and it's  
not her fault she's on this  
earth. She's just a cute  
Amanda panda hangin’ in. Then  
there are the times that I  
really do want to be with her  
and I get into her babiness -  
her constant changing, explo-  
ration, joy, enthusiasm and  
honesty.  

I do dig her and my love  
grows as she does, but in this  
journal I want to stress the  
difficult aspect. Those  
positive moments for me - the  
energy for them is only freed  
up when I don't objectify  
her as a chore to be endured.  
And I don't have to do that  
when we're together out of  
choice. I imagine she knows  
those times I don’t dig being  
with her. And I do believe  

the liberation of children is  
intimately connected to the  
liberation of women to be our  
own selves."

BigMammaRag,1,5,,2,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No5_page002.txt,"NEW MODEL OF LOVE

Society has long defined  
and imposed a clear-cut model  
of the expectations and roles  
between two persons who say  
""I love you."" This estab-  
lished and time-tested model  
(i.e. marriage and the nuclear  
family) has served for centur-  
ies, but the present high  
divorce rate, the numerous  
teenage runaways, and the  
women's Rights movement all  
attest that the old model  
for love does not function  
efficiently in today's social  

cultural realities. Real-  
ities such as the high  
geographic mobility, the di-  
versity of absorbing interests  

and capabilities, and the  
growth of a sure tie usual  
relationship stability, mutual  

emphasis on ""US"" rather than ""I."" The old model mono-  
gamous primary relationship  
is restrictive, despite its  
advantages of security and  
comfort. It is far too easy  
to lose one's identity and  
interests and creativity,  
and eventually that magical  
spark of love which makes  
the restrictions and the  
sacrifice worthwhile.  

Many women have forsaken  
the old model of a permanent  
monogamous relationship in  
favor of serial monogamy —  
a series of intense, one-  
to-one relationships. Others  
have refused to be drawn  
into an intense relationship  
with one person and develop  
instead a group of persons  
to whom they feel close and  
involved, a non-monogamous  
non-primary model. Each model,  
it seems to this writer,  
has serious weaknesses and  
lacks much as a way of life  
to be comfortable with for  
a long period of time.  

Any form of relationship  
must be able to cope with  
basic interaction problems,  
such as: dependency which  
interferes with self-esteem  
and initiative; doing every-  
thing together which encour-  
ages giving up activities  
that the other isn't inter-  
ested in and not meeting  
the need for ""alone time;""  

losing the sense of self;  
viewing the other person  
as a possession with the  
resultant jealousy. Relation-  

ships are traditionally expect-  
ed to fulfill all of one's  
needs and this is perhaps  

the greatest weakness of the  
permanent monogamous model.  

The monogamous model and  
the serial monogamous model  
for love both encourage depen-  
dency, possessiveness, jealousy  
and suffocation of individual  
growth and of self-initiative.  
The non-monogamous non-primary  
relationship model develops  
self-initiative but makes  
it difficult to meet intense  
emotional needs and is  
somewhat defensive  

of opening to another.  
This, however,  

is the essence  
of the new model which more  
nearly nurtures that essence  
of L-o-v-e and adequately  

deals with the basic problems  
has not yet been tested by  
time. But we are forced into  
experimenting and creating  
by the pressures of today's  
realities. It would seem  
that a synthesis of serial  
monogamy and the non-monog-  
amous non-primary relation-  
ship is a solution. The new  
model would have as its center  
a primary relationship - an  
intense one-to-one love rela-  
tionship - surrounded by  

a circle of close secondary  
relationships who supplement  
the missing aspects of the  
primary relationship.  

The amount of time and  
energy spent with the second-  

ary persons would vary with the  

degree to which the primary  
relationship is fulfilling  
the various needs of the  
couple. The degree of ful-  
fillment would never be 100%  
(since the couple would then  
just lock themselves in their  
home and never emerge again)  
and obviously if the degree  
of fulfillment were very low  
the couple would break up,  
but most relationships fall  
somewhere between those two  
extremes and fluctuate over  
time.  

To live this proposed  
model, the individuals must  
be willing to face problems,  
communicate their needs and  
feelings, and be willing  
to grow. The freedom in this  
model is threatening, but  
if the joys of growing, of  
exercising creativity and  
meeting new people are shared  
openly between the couple,  
then all things add to rather  
than subtract from the rela-  
tionship. The couple live  
closer to the hurt of split-  
ting up, because each day  
is a new decision, another  
affirmation of ""I want to  
live with you,"" but this  
keeps a freshness to the rela-  
tionship which is lost in  

the old permanent monogamous  
model. There is fear that  

if one loves many persons,  

the meaning and intensity  

may be lost, but this does  

not seem to be the case. The  
object of the model is not  

to have sex with as many  
persons as possible, but rath-  
er to feel free to interact  
freely and warmly with others,  
to share and grow, and, if  
appropriate, include sexual  
sharing with another.  

This new model is not  
yet tested by centuries of  
experience, but the present  
divorce rate and the emphasis  
on individual identity and  
growth is forcing many to  
consider ways of relating  
intensely and sexually with  
one special person without  
suffocating and stagnating  
as so often happens in the  
traditional monogamous marri-  
age model. Implementing a  
non-monogamous primary rela-  
tionship surrounded by close  
secondary relationships re-  
quires great inner strength,  
inner security and very good  
communication between partners.  
The partners must support  
each other in their weakness  
and must celebrate together  
their strength and their  
growth. It is in this model  
that the greatest rewards may  
be found.

plored in struggle and joy in  
lesbian relationships by Nancy

BigMammaRag,1,5,,5,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No5_page005.txt,"Lost Lesbians of Literature

Natalie Clifford Barney and Renée Vivien, French Poets.

Having spent a year at La Sorbonne, gotten my B.A. in French Literature and gone
on to one year of graduate study, I thought that I knew a good deal about French
poetry. Imagine my surprise when while doing research in an extraordinary book,

I discovered two lesbian poets whose work impressed me deeply. I had studied all
these years and had never heard of these women.

My information comes from a remarkable book: Sex Variant Women in Literature
A Historical And Quantitative Survey, by Jeannette H. Foster, PH.D. Vantage Press,
New York, 1956.* (all references except where otherwise noted will be from this book).
This volume can be consulted at the University of Denver Library. Dr. Foster
covers the entire literary field (up to 1956). Her section on German Literature is
particularly good, but as a French student I will concentrate on my two pet
discoveries.

All of the following analysis is based more or less on Dr. Foster's study, as
neither of these poets is available here in either French or English. With one
exception: Dr. Foster gives no translations, so the interlinear transliterations
are my own. For them I beg indulgence, for I'm no poet.

Strangely enough, The Songs of Bilitis, a rather anemic imitation of Ancient
Greek styles, has been and is popular among lesbians, while Natalie Barney and Renée
Vivien remain unknown and unpublished. Yet both women were contemporaries of Louys
(the man who wrote The Songs). At first they even gave him manuscripts to criticize
seeing in him ** ‘the champion of the young girls of the future'....They found him
more inclined to admire ‘jeux latins et voluptés grecques’ (Latin games and Greek
pleasures) than the ‘exagérées préoccupations’ (exaggerated preoccupations) of
lesbiennes (the common French term for lesbians). *Ibid, p.154.

‘The lesser, from a literary viewpoint, was Natalie Clifford Barney,

an American ...who was able to live independently in Paris and maintain
her own yacht...she had by the late nineties made contact with Pierre
Louys....In the garden of her luxurious Paris residence she built a
Temple of Friendship, and welcomed there many of the literary personalities
of the day"".* Ibid, pp.154-155.

The only two volumes available are Aventures de L'Esprit, [adventures of the
mind] a sort of record of her relationships with the literary notables of her time,
and Actes et Entractes [acts and intermissions]: four poetic dramas and some poems.

One of these, ""Couple,"" is a descriptive and sensuous picture of two lovers:

""Se tenant par la taille-- ainsi que deux bouleaux —
(they hold each other by the waist-- like two birch-trees)
Reliés par leurs branches--
(Joined by their branches--)
Elles vont, ondulant leurs têtes et leurs hanches...
(they pass, swaying their hips and their heads...)
Elles sont dans la nuit ainsi qu'au seuil d'un temple,
(they enter the night like the threshold of a temple)
D'un mystérieux temple...
(of a mysterious temple...)
Si quelque homme, épian ce couple insidieux,
(if some man, seeing this disturbing pair,)
De son mépris le couvre...
(covers them with his contempt...)
Qu'il sache que tout don de beauté plaît aux dieux ;
(let him see that all gifts of beauty are pleasing to the Gods;)
Que les lois ordinaires
(that such ordinary standards)
Ne peuvent s’appliquer à ces noces lunaires...
(could never apply to these lunar embraces...)

Elles ont, d'un élan plus divin qu'animal
(with a passion more divine than animal, they have)
Dans les vastes silences
(in the deep freedom of secrecy)
Joint avec des baisers leurs ressemblances,
(Joined with their kisses their similarity,)
Toutes leurs ressemblances.
(their complete similarity...)
Et par delà la terre, et le bien, et le mal,
(and beyond the world, beyond good, and beyond bad,)
Elles vont, diaphanes
(They pass, transparent)
Et troublantes, et ceux qui les jugent profanes
(and so troubling, and those who think ill of them)
Sont eux-mêmes profanes. * Ibid, [Barney, N. C., Actes et Entractes. Paris
(a themselves ill) Senset, 909] p.157. 

""Of greater literary importance is Renée Vivien [Pauline Tarn, whose poetry has
been pronounced most perfect in form of any French verse written in the first
quarter of the century, and this quality is the more remarkable in that her native
language was not French but English. As she died at thirty-two, its quantity also
deserves mention, for her collected poems run to five hundred pages; besides...
two volumes of 'prose-poems' which a decade later would have been called free verse,
a prose satire, and an autobiographical novel."" Ibid., p.158.

""Vivien was more openly lesbian than any woman so far encountered in Dr.
Foster's book, but the few selections and biographical notes found in anthologies
are careful to conceal this fact,... so she will be discussed here at some
length."" Ibid., p. 159.

I must refer you to Dr. Foster's competent study for this excellent discussion.

BigMammaRag,1,5,,6,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No5_page006.txt,"eg 64  
of Vivien’s life and this relation to her work Here, I only attempt to give an impression of her poetry, hoping to stimulate those who read a little French, and perhaps to interest others in pushing for an English edition of these sisters who were saying seventy years ago what we are shouting now. And in some ways they said it better—speaking of beauty in beautiful words, they praised women without fear, without hangups, in verse of such sensual beauty as has not been equaled since Sappho laid down her pen. (I mean the French originals, of course, not my pitifully inadequate transliterations. After all, most of us know Sappho only through competent translations. Competent translations of at least Renée Vivien we must have!

Her English name was Pauline Tarn. All evidence points to an experience when Vivien was about seventeen. Her family had withdrawn her from happy school-life in Paris with her bosom-friend Violet to prepare her for the marriage market. Revolted by the prospect before her, Vivien poured out her emotions in letters to Violet. By all evidence her relationship with Violet—a very religious and mystical young girl—was completely innocent, but when Vivien's family intercepted these passionate letters they thought otherwise. A horrendous uproar of accusations, hate, and disgust seems to have followed, from which Vivien escaped only on becoming twenty-one, coming into her inheritance, and returning to Paris, free and wealthy in her own right.

Free at last, independently wealthy, Pauline Tarn returned to her beloved Paris, and soon acquired residences in Paris, Nice, and Mitylene, the first of which became legendary for its treasures of antique and oriental art, and to the end of her days she was an inveterate traveler, drunk with her new freedom...she found Violet too serious. Through her, however, she met Natalie Clifford Barney, who introduced her to Sappho. This double revelation: an intelligent woman whose talents, wealth, and sexual tastes matched her own, and a great classical poet who glorified these tastes—here was her “raison d'être,” her life purpose.

Soon after the beginning of her “new life,” perhaps as a symbol of her “pagan” (i.e. Ancient Greek) rebirth, she took the name under which she lived and wrote for the rest of her life: Renée Vivien. A common enough French name, surely, but it is interesting to note that renée means “re-born,” and that vivien has at least some etymological tie to vie (life) and vif, vive (alive, lively).

That at this time Vivien felt a sense of renewal and self-confidence in her newfound faith and pride in her socially despised experience is evident in two poems published in the same book as the one already quoted! (Poesies Completes, p. 152-55) The first, ""Ainsi Je Parlerai"" (what I would say), is a religious-philosophic fantasy concerning what one would say if the Last Judgment actually arrived, complete with a sympathetic and all-forgiving Jesus. What a temptation! (In that almost excessively moral era, almost everyone believed, really believed, and the worst sinners treasured the hope of a deathbed repentance and heaven's glory, for weren't they Christians, the chosen people? Hadn't Christ washed away all their sins if only they repented?)

Vivien has obviously no desire to repent. In ""Ainsi Je Parlerai"" she seems unaware of any sin at all. Although this complacent confidence does not survive unabated throughout her work, naturally enough, her sincerity and “liberation” at this time is conveyed in the innocent exaltation of her poems:

Ainsi Je Parlerai (what I would say)  
le Seigneur penchait son front sur mon trépas (if the Blessed Saviour came to my deathbed)  
Tui dirais: O Christ Je ne te connais pas. (I would say; Christ, I do not know you.)  
(Lord, your strict law has never been)  
Je vécus ainsi qu'un simple païen... (I lived as a simple pagan...)  
Le monde était autour de moi, tel un jardin. (the world was all around me just like a garden.)  
Je bus l'aube claire et le sol cristallin. (I drank the clear dawn and the crystalline twilight.)  
Le soleil me ceignait de ses plus vives flammes, (the sun girdled me round with his most eager fires,)  
Et l'amour m'incline vers la beauté des femmes. (and toward the beauty of women Love turned my desires.)  
Pardonne-moi, qui fus une simple païenne (so pardon me, who was a simple pagan!)  
Taisse-moi retourner vers Ta splendeur ancienne (Let me return to my ancient glory.)  
Et, puisque enfin l'instant éternel est venu, (and since at last the eternal moment has come,)  
Rejoindre celles-là qui n'ont point connu. (rejoin those who never could have known you.)

Vivien neither asks for forgiveness nor the hope of heaven; she would prefer instead to go to the pleasant, earthlike purgatory where the theology of the time placed those “good"" pagans who had lived before the coming of Christ, and so had no chance to accept him. The particular pagans Vivien has in mind are clearly indicated by the use of the French pronoun celles-là in the last line. Sappho was perhaps not ‘on the list,’ so to speak, of good pagans at this particular time in history, but this specific feminine pronoun leaves no doubt as to which part of the ancient pagans she preferred—the splendor of the ancients to the joy of heaven.

The purpose of the Denver Sustaining Fund is to recycle to ourselves alternative institutions. Establish a procedure to financially sustain organizations which are serving the needs of poor people, working people, women, and minorities.

The desire is in us less strong than tenderness... (with us lust is less violent than tenderness, less powerful than touch)  
Et nos maîtresses ne sauraient nous décevoir, (and our lovers could never disappoint us, really.)  
Puisque c'est l'infini que nous aimons en elles... (because we seek perfection with them, and don't demand it from them...)  
Nos jours sans impudeur, sans crainte ni remords (our days, without shame, without fear or remorse)  
Se déroulent, ainsi que de larges accords, (unroll like mid-ocean waves; broad, calm, and deep,)  
Et nous nous aimons, comme ils aimaient à Mitylene. (and we love each other, like they loved at Mitylene.)

Dr. Foster says about this poem:  
""Far from being the mere defiant sacrilege this seemed to some readers, it was the confession of a new faith to replace the one in whose name England had damned her.” 

In an age of Faith—hypocritical or not—this is a remarkable poem. There is no guilt, no scent of sin, and Vivien‘s witty twist of conventional theology at the end is not only clever but daring.

Vivien established a villa at Mitylene, and became for a time the dedicated priestess of the new “Golden Age.” The following lines from ""Les Plaisirs"" show her self-confidence and liberated spirit at this time. This was in fact the most ""right-on"" period of her life, before health, unwise love affairs, and false friends had time to tarnish the Golden Ideal. Commonly enough, her best poetry was yet to come. But the poetry of pain, of disillusion, in other words the work of maturity (yet she died at thirty-two!) is, while it may be better poetry than these ""Youthful Pieces,"" beyond the scope of this article.

I do intend, however, to follow Renée Vivien on my own as far as the Denver area's limited facilities permit. Anyone who has ever heard of these women—even a name in an index or a line in a book—should write Barbara Kline, c/o The Lesbian Center, Women in Transition House, 1895 Lafayette St., Denver.

Surely the time is now for an edition of her works in English (preferably Bi-Lingual) for a poet of whom Reinach wrote the following...  
""I could quote from these volumes at least two hundred verses which rank among the finest specimens of French poetry... I am aware that there are some objectionable elements...but her genius—for genius she had—is the more extraordinary as she wrote in a language not her own. I feel sure she will be famous someday, and think it desirable that we should try to know more about her before it gets too late.” 

Dr. Foster goes on to say:  
“All the critics who grant her this superlative poetic quality agree that she has received nothing approaching her due recognition because of the lesbian element in her work. In view of the small number of persons in any generation who are tolerant of such love, it may be that she will never receive it.” 

All I can hope is that women and lesbians remain fashionable and “in” long enough to become, at least momentarily, a popular subject for scholarship, so that universities have the money and facilities to dig up the primary texts and get them into print. Once our lost literature is available in print, it's up to us. If Sappho Was a Lesbian Woman (no insult intended—it's a fine book, but strictly contemporary movement literature, not Belle Lettres) satisfies your needs, that’s fine. But this is our culture; it's been hidden from us; it's been simply neglected; it will soon be lost forever to us, our successors, our children. You don't ever have to actually read this stuff if you don’t want to. There will always be crazy women wild to study, and always, the humanity and need it to you from. Now before you get offended, remember High School Lit... Remember Dickinson and Herman Melville, remember Julius Caesar or whichever bored you most. Starlet penne? Hiss Magner? I'm not saying it would be any better, would be refreshing to hear; it's just too dull! If you can't read it, don't! Nonsense! Bullshit, that's all.

Denver Sustaining Fund

The money for this fund will come from two sources: a voluntary tax on items people purchase from various businesses which are participating in the fund (the community chain) and from individuals pledging a certain amount of their weekly paychecks (the community cache).

A board of directors has been established which receives money based on continued support from the community.

at some point felt uncomfortable having only options given  
to us by a world controlled by men,

five years or so I've gone  
it hard for people to imagine

that because my lover is not a man, my love and/or commitment

it is hard for people to imagine what we are.  
""How a beautiful friendship blossomed"" or  
(The Crescent Wrench meets the Pen-knife)  
A True Story By Linda T.  

The day began simply, but beautifully.  
I rode my bicycle to the hardware store and bought a crescent wrench,  
then I pedaled on to a bicycle store and bought a generator set.  
From that point on I was truly content.  
I was successfully mechanical, and I was using my own tool.  
Unfortunately, no one else seemed to appreciate my joy,  
but I decided that was only to be expected.  
Besides, I was too proud of myself to  
really be touched by rudeness or teasing.  

But later that evening, something different occurred.  
I was still ecstatic, although my roommates were beginning  
to get tired of me. Then my friend, Linda, stopped by.  
She: Look at my Genuine Crescent Wrench!  
Me: It's beautiful!  
She: See my new pen-knife? I just found it today!  
Me: Wow--it's really nice!

Marie Loves Biastmase A Seery

By Debbie 3.

Marie's apartment had a
window which looked down onto
the quiet street in the city,
or onto the other old houses,
or showed a hint of the mount-
ains between the houses across
the street. The mountains
were the view Marie chose to
look at this evening. They
were why she had chosen to
move to Denver. But Denver
had become a cold, lonely,
city for Marie. It contained
few friends for her. She had
been in Denver for almost a
year, a year contained of few
events but many memories of
Rosemary. Rosemary was a
close friend from back East to
whom she had written for a
year at the email address
Marie had graduated from last
year, and where they both met
in a small ""Social Concerns""
class the year before.

Marie was a good student in
college, majoring in Sociology.
In her senior year of studies,
she was quiet and
well liked by most of the
girls in the dorm.
She dated a
boyfriend

who didn't seem to adapt
in that atmosphere. It
seemed to bother Marie;
but it did bother the few girl
friends, and it especially
bothered her parents.

After all, her friends'
parents reminded her, college was to find the
one and only man for you to
spend your life with, and how
could she do this if
men like him were not around?

Rosemary was outgoing,
pretty and popular with the
men. She had quit her sorority
at the end of her sophomore
year feeling it was silly and
hypocritical. At the same time
she became active in the
peace movements on campus. Her

sharp skirts and pretty
sweaters changed to blue jeans

and work shirts. With all this
change, her boyfriend had be-
come critical and felt she was
becoming too radical for his
taste in women. Instead of
trying to talk through her
transition at Rosemary's pleas,
he wanted the relationship to
break up. So she gave back his
fraternity pin with feelings
of hurt and defeat but hoping
he might really want her back,

always hoping. But now her time
was spent with Marie, and
she enjoyed her moments totally
alone with her.

When Marie was approaching
her graduation, she wondered
what was going to happen in
the future. Her life philo-
sophy was centered around the
now time. Nothing was impor-
tant in the past, nor should
one worry about the future.
All energy and emotion should
be put into the present, the
now. But the paradox appeared
when she panicked at the
thought of graduating and not
coming back next fall to
school. She had to make some
plans for the future, something
to look forward to. She de-
cided it was a decision that
Rosemary should have a part in
also. They had talked about it
off and on, but one day de-
cided, since it was such a
beautiful day, to go into the
park and talk about both their
futures.

They both loved to explore
the park and thought they had
explored all of it when they
came upon a quiet, secluded
part far from the road, the
college, and any other person.
That was where they both de-
cided Marie should go on to
Denver, to explore a new city
and wait for Rosemary to grad-
uate. Then Rosemary would
join her in Denver, and they
both would stay there or go on
to San Francisco or Europe.
That was also where Marie

really saw the beauty in
Rosemary's eyes and her
emotions moved her enough to
venture a touch on Rosemary's

cheek with her finger. 

Rosemary was not startled by
the touch, she accepted it

fully. Marie took her finger
lightly down Rosemary's face
to the side of her mouth.
There she moved her finger
over Rosemary's lips lightly,
gently. Rosemary bent over
Marie and kissed her on the
lips, softly, delicately. Then
again they kissed and again
and their fingers ran through
each other's long, brown hair
that flowed on their bodies.

That was what Marie re-
membered now of Rosemary, her
softness, her beauty. Marie
would get letters weekly and
an occasional phone call to
keep her memories of Rosemary
flowing. Rosemary would soon
join her, and they would be
happily together again. Marie
was certainly unhappy now, but
in the future with Rosemary
she would be happy, they would
be happy.

The next few days in Denver
passed slowly in Marie's life.
Her horrible job in the office
added to her misery with the
people who mocked her for not
being a part of their ugly
world. But one day contained
a letter from Rosemary which
was greatly needed by Marie.
She ripped it open reading
rapidly. It read of trivial
matters in Rosemary's last
days at college, the papers
due, the tests coming up, and
more about some silly man
Rosemary had met. This upset
Marie, he was more a part of
Rosemary's life with each
letter. Marie became more
frustrated while reading
further about him. Then she
came upon the passage in the
letter that talked about
Rosemary moving into an apart-
ment with him after graduation.
Nothing was mentioned about
coming to Denver or being with
Marie. All was about him and
living with him.

Marie started pacing
around the apartment furiously.
She had no sense of things
around her, nor could she see
anything outside herself.
Miraculously, she did not bump
into anything but internally
she bumped into every memory
of Rosemary she possessed.
Marie had something in her
hand, heavy, hard, cold. She
then saw it flying through the
room crashing against the wall.
She then heard a scream that
started deep inside her and
found its way out through her
mouth.

Tears ran down her cheeks
as she went to the phone. She
became irritated when she
couldn't readily find Rosemary's
number. But why would she
need it when she knew it by
heart? She tried to steady
her hand and read the numbers
through the tears in her eyes.
The numbers clicked away, the
line connected, the ring,
Rosemary's voice. Marie
thought she would choke, no
words would come out at first,
but she was surprised at the

ease with which she spoke after.

Halloween Is Fer Clowns

By Meredith Britt Other people were going home from her two-week vacation.
In the refrigerator I found
""All who have been Halloween Clowns, take heart. 
There is still candy in the entrance of the stranger's house. The pumpkin grins. The porchlight still burns.""
Five o'clock is the time to go home, but the job wasn't done. ""Gotta go to the bank,"" 
I thought lying on my head on the floor of the driver's side of a Chevy pickup, my feet 
through the window of the open door. Bill leaned over to whisper obscenities in my ear, hitting his head on the steering wheel. 
He then took our customers aside to break the bad news. They took it well. I was left 
alone again in the quiet solitude of my botched up job. I had cut my finger, the incision was about 4 millimeters in length, two fifty-firsts of an inch wide, and I questioned the advisibility of stitches. 
I went to wash my hands and think about things. It occurred to me that it had been a long time since I had really enjoyed kissing a woman. 
Six o'clock and I'm asked if I would mind going to Littleton to get a truck. I didn't mind. By the time I got back downtown the shop was closed so I was forced to go home, ""Yo, not yet,"" 
Seven-fifteen, a downpour of rainwater all over Auraria, no windshield wipers, a premature dusk and I'm home. Checked the mail...no mail, 
Looked to inspect the gash in my finger but couldn't find it. Fat Six sleeping in the chair still hadn't had her kittens. 
I called my friend, Beanie, to see if she was back from her trip. The phone kept ringing lifelessly until I hung up. 
The fifteenth day of the month."

LESBIAN NATION  
Written by Jill Johnston  

Lesbian Nation is the product of  
an authoress whose unique writing  
style is probably one of the most  
revolutionary cultural tools given to  
the Lesbian Feminist Movement,  
the Women's Movement, and possibly  
the world.  

The book is peppered with brilliant  
insight into the phenomena of Lesbian  
Feminism, and into herself, and the  
changes she has undergone in both  
her creative and political life.  

It took this writer about two hours  
in the back of a car traveling through  
the Salt Flats of Utah, to appreciate  
Ms. Johnston's writing ability, reading  
excerpts of past Village Voice columns  
kindly provided me by one Lake Circumspect. When I finally finished reading  
them I felt as if I had met a very inter-  
esting, though obscure person. I wanted  
to know more about her.  

Lesbian Nation offered me the oppor-  

tunity to see more of Ms. Johnston's  
writing and to see much of the obscurity  
thrown off to reveal a very honest account  
of herself. Many of her theories on  
Feminism, I believe to be the logical  
evolvement the Lesbian Feminist Move-  

ment will be making.  

If you want a little stimulus  
and some new ideas, this is definitely  
a book you should read.  

The First Sex by  
Elizabeth Gould Davis  

""Barbara Kline""  

In this book Ms. Davis  
presents a variety of arguments for the superiority  
of woman never yet assembled together in a single  
volume. Pre-historical conjecture and hypotheses  
(i.e. Atlantis, etc.), biology, history, anthropol-  
ogy and above all archaeology are woven together to  
present a very convincing thesis.  

However, it discloses many pos-  

sible holes in this tapestry. This is not to say  
that Ms. Davis gets her facts wrong. Indeed, the author  
is very scrupulous to point out where she departs from  
facts into conjecture.  

Her conjecture doesn't always hold up; sometimes  
she goes a bit too far, in my opinion. Male reviewers  
and male readers will undoubtedly use this against  
the basic thesis of the book. However, in the opinion of  
this reviewer, The First Sex could be shorn of all  
Ms. Davis' fascinating though ""un scholarly"" hy-  
potheses and the facts would be much duller, but the ar-  
gument presented would be valid.  

And so regardless of  
some lack of university-  
oriented standards of ""scholarship"", I strongly urge every  
woman to read this book. Every woman, because, though  
written from a strictly heterosexual point of view, it  
presents many interesting and useful archaeological facts  
and discoveries previously unknown to this reviewer and  
undoubtedly to most women,  

which may be very helpful to parents  
and other heterosexual loved ones. Most of all, however, Sappho Was A  
Right On Woman presents Lesbianism  
as a valid and often preferable alter-  
native lifestyle in the context of our  
patriarchal world today.  

SAPPHO WAS A RIGHT ON  
WOMAN  
Written by Sidney Abbot  
and Barbara Love  
(Stein and Day, 1972)  

""In America They Call Us Dykes""  
from Our Bodies, Our Selves  
a Simon and Schuster publication.  
By Kate S.  

When the first edition of  
Our Bodies, Our Selves was  
published the only mention of  
lesbianism in the book was  
found in a few paragraphs in  
the chapter on sexuality;  
squeezed between the topics  
of fantasies and masturba-  
tion.  

Now that the second edition has hit the shelves we  
find an entire chapter devoted  
to lesbianism with the title,  

""In America They Call Us Dykes"". Throughout the chap-  

ter we find that a much needed  
and long awaited pride and be-  
lief in lesbianism is portrayed.  

Like Sappho Was A Right On Woman  
then, I might have gotten a much  
truer and prouder view of myself as  
both a Lesbian and a woman.  
""In America They Call Us Dykes"", continues in this vein  
of strength and pride by giving  
the stories of the lives  
of four lesbians. These stories  
are told honestly and candidly and cover every emo-  
tional gamut of Lesbianism  
from jealousy toward the boy-  
friends of close female friends,  
to pressures felt to conform  
to heterosexuality, to lesbian ""  
phobia"".  

The chapter deals again  
candidly with the advantages  
and pitfalls to ""telling""  
friends and family. We also  
read of job discrimination  
directed toward Lesbians and  
also of problems caused by  
the law and by the medical  

professions.  

Drawing on the personal experiences  
of both the authors and other Lesbians,  
the book is a proud and clear-cut expli-  
cation of both Lesbianism and Feminism.  
Usually linking one with the other, it  
goes on to affirm and explain why  
Lesbians are probably some of the strong-  
est and healthiest individuals in our  
society today. The authors pull no  
punches about being gay and proud and  
often throw in a few of their own.  

The book in its entirety offers  
meaning for the younger Lesbian who  
may be unsure of what it really means  
for a woman to be gay; it gives hope  
to the older Lesbian who may have  
always had to live with the lies of  
a double existence and it puts forth a  

prideful and forward explanation."

IT HAPPENED

and college days and I will
never again be ashamed of
either. Most of my friends
are women who identify them-
selves as women and who now
see many solutions to con-
temporary outrages through

feminist eyes. Trying to
live our lives with that kind

of consciousness always in
mind is often difficult,
FRUSTRATING, and even madden-
ing, but it can be exhilarat-
ing as well.

At least I have learned to be
proud. Whereas I was once
perverted, abnormal, and some-
thing less than human, I am
now prideful, beautiful, and
sometimes even superior about
myself because I am Lesbian.

Chocolate

At both
levels I was and am
afraid.

I was afraid before
because I thought I was an
outcast to be shunned and
whispered about (now I know
I'm an outcast, but being an
outcast is my strength). I
am afraid now because I know
there are people who would
not hesitate to kill me—and
kill me with self-righteous-
ness. Being a Lesbian who

is out front, I am immediately
a threat to this entire pat-
riarchal society—a society
that has become so corrupt
and fascistic it would will-
ingly annihilate anyone who
dares to oppose it (often as
long as that annihilation is
undercover—shades of WATER -
GATE). Before, I was a mon-
ster inside of myself (and
that was the monster) but now,
as Robin Morgan put it, ""I
AM A MONSTER AND I AM PROUD.""

I am also happy because

I will continue to be a ""mon-
ster"" as long as we live in

a world where people are only
as free as far as the wire tap
on their telephones, where
every minority must suffer for
their differences and where
every woman—in the context

of our lives—must be a pros-
titute to someone or some-
thing.

I know that I must con-
tinue to be an outcast be-
cause I can never again be
part of that system, that
I will spend my whole life
functioning outside of it
and that I will do every-
thing in my power to stop
its insensitive destruction
of women's souls.

Children can be amazingly per-
ceptive. My lover, Linda,
went with me to my parents
last Christmas, just as any
happily married couple would.
Everyone was polite to her,
as my roommate; and only
slowly pieced together their
suspicions that our relation-
ship might be different. Ex-
cept for my six-year-old nep-
hew. Kent immediately sensed
our feelings for each other,
accepted it, and put it all
into the only model he knew:
Linda was my husband. Even
though her name was feminine
she obviously had to be a
boy. When we insisted that
she was a girl, he just pro-
ceeded to ask other people,
hoping to eventually find
someone who agreed she was

a boy. The really intri-
guing part was that he also
recognized the sexuality of
the situation. Although we
had never even held hands in
his presence at one point he
teasingly delivered a de-
scriptive monologue on the
subject. ""I know what you do
in bed—You hug and kiss and
everything."" (giggle)

And he was six years old!

BigMammaRag,1,5,,15,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol1No5_page015.txt,"""ARMY SISTERHOOD? ~~

Do you wonder if Lesbians
and women in general possess
Sisterhood in the Women's Army
Corps? Well, you can stop
wondering; they don't. There
may be a few individuals here
and there, mostly there, but
the general view presents
back-stabbing and ""save-your-
own-ass"" attitudes. Most of
the women in the Army are
Lesbians, not all of them
though. This majority consists
of many career women and most
definitely ""lifers"". The rest
are young women entering the
service right out of high
school or college. Many are
already gay when they enter
but many women are brought out
after entering. The big, bad,
sexual perversion a woman
heard about from her parents
and friends before joining,
suddenly becomes very natural
and she discovers there are
other women that feel just
like her. So, she lets it all
hang out, and acts naturally;
acts the way she would have
before society's blind, narrow

minded claws sank into her

and brain-washed her. However,
the Army isn't the ideal place
for one to discover herself.
The Army considers homo-
sexuality a sexual perversion,
and proof of one's sexual
practice in this field can
lead to an undesirable dis-
charge. However, in an almost
heroic attempt to protect its
best workers, it has made it
more difficult to be boarded
out on this charge. In the
past, it took only a pen in a

gossip's hand to ruin a woman's

career, or present job. Now,
pictures, witnesses, and
statements must be presented
before a board of officers
will even be staffed. The reasoning
behind this change could have
been motivated by any of the
following: 1) A gossip or busy-
body could ruin an innocent
woman's career because of her
dislike for her or jealousy.

2) Women, heterosexual or homo-
sexual, could sign themselves
out as a lesbian if they were
sick of the Army. 3) And fin-
ally, because of a confidential
survey, the Army has discovered
its most efficient workers
are usually gay.

In any event, the gay women
in the Army aren't the best
sisters, (and I use the term
‘sisters' lightly).

For instance, a woman of
rank will unveil her sister of
lower rank to make herself
look good, or ""straight"". This
usually doesn't happen right
out of thin air. The woman of
lower rank may be suspected
and with a little help from
her ""friends"", the action can
be completed. This also hap-
pens frequently between women
of equal rank and not always

involves sexuality. So you
see, you're never really safe.
Often, a gay orderly room
(administrative personnel),
will ""hang"" someone if they
don't like her, feel she knows
too much about them, or a

“make tentative plans.

close to them
of her. If they
have enough evidence to get
discharged, they can usually
transfer them to another unit
under a trouble-maker label, or
at the least, just plain cause
her a lot of hell and hassle.
When they do this,
often hoping for a breaking
point. Not all orderly rooms
are this way, nor all WACS.
But, I'm only striving to let
the rust show besides the shin-
ing silver.

I heard a rumor before I
was discharged, that the Army
may legalize homosexuality
because of the survey I
mentioned above. Will this change
the sisterhood scene? I cer-
tainly hope so!

WOMANNING A BOOTH -- I’m at the

Lesbian Center booth during the

Women's Festival which was soon-
sored by .O.% in August.

The Denver Lesbian Cen-
ter has been considering the
possibility of a regional
conference some time this
year. We have heard of les-
bian groups in Boulder, Ft.
Collins, Colorado Springs,
Manitou Springs and Albuquer-
que; and we suspect there may
be others.

One idea we have dis-
cussed is that of a planning
session during Thanksgiving
weekend. This would be a
time for representatives from
each interested group to set
together, share ideas, and
These
plans could then be taken
back to the local groups and
revised as necessary. Hope-
fully we can avoid at least
some of the tensions that
seem to come with conferen-
ces.

If you are interested,
please let us know. We are

Feminist Reviews

are recorded that we are all too familiar with but which nonetheless need to be recounted.

A full two pages are given to a discussion of the psychology professions. Several appalling case histories are given and the truth revealed about the psychology professions' seemingly total ineptitude in dealing with homosexuality.

The bar scene is examined honestly for what it is and what it provides women. In the bars, the book says, ""booze flows, alcoholism is encouraged and sometimes fights break out."" But while lamenting that there are few places that aren't out to make money off of us, we are reminded that ""there is no other place to be with lots of other gay women, open and unashamed, to dance, hold each other close...""

The single longest topic division is the topic entitled “Loving.” Again, we find extremely moving stories from the lives of women dealing with such things as coming out, daring to fall in love with a woman, dealing with jealousy, and the dynamics of a loving lesbian relationship.

Also, in ""In America They Call Us Dykes,"" a working-class woman describes her life and writes a poem criticizing middle-class women for their ""liberalism"" and ignorance of their own class privilege. Lesbian motherhood is the topic dealt with and here we find discussions of informing one's children of one's lesbianism, raising children without a man, and lesbians' fight for the custody of their children.

At full value, Our Bodies, Our Selves is extremely honest and informative and breaks through the many previous taboos and unspokens of female sexuality, physiology, and health care. Some of the rest of the book may not be of TREMENDOUS interest to lesbians (chapters on birth control, childbearing, heterosexual sexuality) but certainly the chapters on nutrition, exercise, self-defense, menopause, the health care system, etc. pertain to lesbians as well as to heterosexual women. I only regret the first edition's liberal attitude toward and almost total dismissal of lesbianism.

Carol Lease

Last August I saw New York City. The Palisades looked like a fortress against the city across the river. Manhattan crowded with dominoes end on end ready to fall. I paid my dues at the Museum of Modern Art and watched a ragged man beat his skinny dog for refusing to drink gutter water. A family of old men set up house with a sofa and an old stove and table under a viaduct to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Staten Island Ferry transported hoppy school children and seagulls watched to know exactly when to fly out of the ferry’s path. And in New York City in August of 1973 there was a press conference announcing the existence of a Black Feminist organization.

Late last November the National Black Feminist Organization held its first conference in New York. About 400 women from widely diverse backgrounds attended plenary sessions, participated in informal discussions and workshops covering issues that included welfare, child care, addiction, employment, Lesbianism and “the relation of Black women to one another and to the Women’s Rights Movement.”

White women’s liberation groups, according to NBFO founders, didn’t respond to the specific needs of Black feminist women. “There was no real communication, no cultural communication,” explains Doris Wright a member of NOW. “I can’t be concerned with making it on Wall Street - not that NOW doesn’t try to do something about child care and welfare, but it’s only attracted white middle-class women.”

Black men see the Women’s Movement as a “takeover plot,” according to Reverend Magora Kennedy of the Boston Women’s Movement, “and say that if a Black woman isn’t having a baby and standing behind her man, then she’s not a woman.” She also cited Stokely Carmichael’s statement on the position of women and the Black Panther emphasis on “having male children for the revolution” as ways in which Black men had kept Black women “subservient.”

According to the report on the NBFO conference in the December-January issue of Off Our Backs, not all the women who attended the conference were in basic agreement with the women who had formed the organization, namely, that the NBFO is a part of the Women’s Movement addressing itself to the specific concerns of Black women.

These issues were not resolved in the plenary sessions and were probably discussed in workshops but since the white female press wasn’t allowed into the workshops and the Black female press was told not to report on them, whether or not any resolutions were reached on these issues is unknown. Press releases and workshop transcripts have yet to be released. Membership to NBFO is restricted to Black women only.

However, Jane Galvin Lewis, one of the co-founders, said that the direction of the NBFO will not be changed because of objections raised by some conference participants. “This organization was formed for certain reasons, and those reasons still exist. There are plenty of other organizations that Black women who don’t agree with our basic tenets can join. We see ourselves as part of the Women’s Movement, a part with a special interest. We're not separatist.”

Angela Wilson, a member of NBFO, was the sole Coloradan at the conference. She saw “feminism in action” by the fact that so many women of such different ages and experiences were present. She was impressed by the organization that went into the conference that was tight and got things done, but was “loose enough to let changes occur” and left plenty of room for the individual. There isn’t any leadership ego-tripping apparent yet in NBFO, a lethal aspect that “tends to break any movement because leadership then doesn’t listen to the people.” Workshops were closed to the white female press because it was felt that some women “wouldn’t be as open” if white women were present.

Busy Getting Established

As far as Denver is concerned, Ms. Wilson believes that no chapter of the NBFO has been established because “Black middle-class women in Park Hill and in other parts of Denver are too busy establishing themselves in professions and poor Black women are too busy surviving day to day.”

Also—the impressions that Black women receive about Women's liberation and Feminism come from the media which can often distort women’s issues, focus on outlandish, unrepresentative aspects of feminism, or actually report what is happening in established women’s liberation groups which is often irrelevant to their lives.

Don’t Black women and white women have some of the same political, social, economic problems and priorities? It seems that the dichotomy of this segregated society has prevented Black women and white women from forming an alliance. In Wilson's opinion it’s a question of how you want to die: “slowly by marrying and moving to Englewood or quickly by living in a Black neighborhood and having your brain and body deteriorate.”

“A lot of Black men are very oppressive. They are oppressed by white society and in turn oppress the Black woman. When they move up through education they leave the Black community behind and criticize the Black women for the ‘matriarchal’ Black family,” Ms. Wilson insists. The oppressed accept and imitate the oppressor. So white patriarchal society means a Black patriarchal society. The strength and resourcefulness that the Black woman has had to develop is critical not only to her immediate survival but to her discovery of her own Feminism.

Recognizing Sexism

Organizations that are community-based and have grassroots support are “those that survive.” The National Black Feminist Organization is no exception. Black women in their own communities will have to recognize sexism and oppression and organize around their individual Feminist needs and priorities. Ms. Wilson thinks that “maybe a way to organize a Black Feminist action group would be for those Black women who are in Women’s Liberation groups to recognize specific needs for themselves and then establish a chapter.

Or maybe a group of Black women who, say, work in a hospital, could organize better because in their everyday lives they confront sexist oppression and are forced to live with it. They have no choice.

Or maybe we could just get an office going... the fact that it was existing might help Black women realize their power. But Denver is a complacent city. I don’t think there are 10 or 15 Black Feminists in this city.”

In the Black civil rights groups and in white leftist politics the personal life of the militant was unaffected by her political beliefs. Here lies the difference in Feminist orientation. No separation exists between the political and personal life of the Feminist. She lives her politics.

Not the Women’s Fault

“It isn’t the fault of Black women in Denver that nothing is being organized considering the struggle Black women have to go through,” according to Ms. Wilson. “It is a positive step for a Black woman when she sees sexism and oppression and realizes that her struggle isn’t for tomorrow but today."" To realize the strength that organizing gives and the potential that a nationally organized group can give seems to be the next step for the Black woman in Denver.

The National Black Feminist Organization will have its first convention this summer to draw up a constitution and set policies. Whether or not Denver is represented will depend on Black Feminist consciousness in the Rocky Mountain Region.

Some arguments against Black feminism are that Black women can't afford to be competitive with Black men, that Black women have no time for Feminism because of their struggle to stabilize their families, that Black women tend to see all discrimination against them as being racist in origin, that Black women don’t have time to take up a white middle-class cause like Women’s Liberation unless they're trying to hide from the realities of the struggle for Black liberation. Impressions of ceaseless distortive rhetoric that tend to perpetuate the power of those that mouth it—not the powerless!

The rhetoric ends when the facts emerge. It is a fact that many Black women identify themselves as Feminists, that a national organization has been formed around that realization, and that once again national census figures reveal an increasing numerical discrepancy between females and males in the Black population of this country.

More Females than Males

The 1970 census shows that there are 1,096,000 more Black females than there are Black males. The 1960 census recorded the difference in the female-male ratio to be 648,000. Up to the age of 14 the Black male population slightly exceeds the female population. Then the decline begins.

In “Jim Crow and Jane Crow” from “Black Women in White America,” Pauli Murray says that “... while it is now generally known that women are constitutionally stronger than men, that male babies are more fragile than female babies... that the male death rate is slightly higher and life expectancy for males is shorter than that of females, the numerical imbalance between the sexes (of Blacks) is more dramatic than in any group in the United States.”

Between the ages of 15 and 24 there are 92 Black men for every 100 Black women. In the 25-49 age group the ratio is 84 to 100. There are about one and a half million more Black women over 14 years of age than there are Black men. The social implications of these statistics place the Black woman in a position where her life transcends the issue of civil rights. Again Ms. Murray states: “Equality for the Black woman must mean equal opportunity to compete for jobs and to find a mate in the total society. For as long as she is confined to an area in which she must compete fiercely for a mate, she will remain the object of sexual exploitation and the victim of all the social evils which such exploitation involves.”

Women have been traditionally expected to marry, produce children and household labor, and be largely if not totally economically dependent on their husbands. This keeps women out of competition in the job market. But now there is an entire group of women that may not be able to marry and will have to be self-supporting perhaps while also supporting others. Can Black women afford to subordinate sex discrimination to race discrimination? Feminism is an undeniable economic reality to all women, and an urgent one to Black women."

A woman's place:  
Breaking Bonds  

Janet Sergi  

Women are changing. What is a  
woman's place? How can we  
become new women? Today old  
modes of acting and interacting  
with one’s self and others are  
unacceptable. We cannot be the  
ever-nurturing females that  
many of our mothers were.  

Both our biological and  
mythical mother figures have  
forsaken their own identities to  
shape and mold their daughters  
and sons into the roles the  
patriarchy needs. Sons become  
workers or the professional  
elites. These males are  
psychically nurtured from birth  
to death by females: first by  
their mothers, then by  
mothering wives, and lastly by  
mothering daughters/nurses in  
old age.  

In a patriarchy, sons revolt  
from their nuclear family ties  
and set off on their own. In the  
course of a man’s rebellion, he  
finds a female who performs the  
nurturing role for him. In  
heterosexual men this takes the  
form of a wife and the cheap  
service and labor of women in  
the economy; homosexual men  
just have the latter.  

Women are men’s prime  
possession. This is the reason for  
the extreme competitiveness and  
aggression of males. The results  
are war, capitalism and of  
course, woman's  
dehumanization. She is but an  
object. Her function is to serve  
man. She cannot help herself  
nor her female children. A  
female has no identity other  
than her connection to the male,  
i.e. women take the last name of  
their closest male relative.  

Mothers break their bonds  
with their female child early.  
The daughter begins to nurture  
the other children in the family  
and dotes on her father before  
she is grown. Freud is incorrect.  
The daughter is socialized in a  
patriarchy to nurture her father  
and all men not for love but for  
survival. She turns into a  
mother/wife before she is  
allowed to be a daughter, a  
female to herself. This lack of  
mother nurture and female self  
identity produces much hatred  
and jealousy among women.  

This kind of horizontal  
hostility among women weakens  
them and makes them more  
amenable and available to the  
male power structure. The  
female has only one role, that of  
mother. Still after four years of  
feminist training, I tend to think  
of others first, afraid or unsure  
of my own needs.  

A new role for woman would  
be that of a daughter, a female  
for herself. A daughter nurtures  
herself. A daughter rebels  
against everything that denies  
her her own energy. A daughter  
climbs every hill and valley of  
experience without even the  
thought, “Is this proper for a  
woman to do?” A daughter to  
herself, is the greatest threat to  
the patriarchy. She deprives men  
of female nurture and service.  

Men use women's energy to  
control the world for their own  
benefit. Control and power are  
the unifying concepts of sexism,  
racism, classism and imperialism.  
White, upper class men control  
the rest of the world’s energy.  
First, they usurp their mother’s  

energy, then through their  
patriarchy they become a  
parasite to all women, the lower  
classes, and other races.  
Females, racial minorities, the  
working classes and the Third  
World have no identity or power  
other than their nurturing role  
to white males.  

Radical feminism begins to  
break this cycle of oppression.  
Daughters become daughters to  
themselves. Females begin to  
have a self-identity. They keep  
their own power and energy  
unto themselves. Thus white  
males are deprived of ill-gotten  
energy. Men are not allowed all  
their mother’s energies. The  
cycle begins to break. Men are  
not given the right to other  
people's energy, be they female,  
poor or racially different.  

What is needed is a daughter’s  
rebellion. Rebellious women are  
daughters to themselves; the  
vitalities of a new order. A  
daughter to herself keeps her  
power and energy to herself and  
thus stops the vicious cycle of  
white male supremacy.  
Concretely, we need to learn  
skills in all fields of human  
endeavor. And we need  
to build a woman's community.  

These communities should be  
social and political units capable  
of giving love and support, time  
and energy, and wisdom and  
knowledge to other women. A  
women’s community is the place  
where women’s energy will be  
generated and stored.  

The minority and Third  
World Communities are building  
their power bases. Likewise  
women must regroup themselves  
for the long task ahead. We are  
working for a place where each  
of us is powerful unto herself.  
The patriarchy needs to be  
replaced, not by a matriarchy  
nor any form of hierarchy, but  
by an energized society. It might  
be called a woman's place;  
a woman's place is a place for  
herself.

I'm frustrated. How do I start? From the beginning. When I started this article for Big Mama Rag, I knew no more about what was happening in legislation affecting women than that the Equal Rights Amendment had been passed in Colorado but hadn't been ratified in enough states to make it a constitutional amendment.

I interviewed Bonnie Andrikopoulos for the information I needed. She’s the NOW lobbyist for this year. Bonnie called this “the unfeminine year” regarding any legislative action on women's issues. It wasn’t very encouraging but we went on anyway. Buzz Wilder (Governor Vanderhoof’s legislative assistant) told Ms. Andrikopoulos that the governor did not want anything on his call that didn’t relate to the land issue, the energy crisis, prison reorganization, and the Denver annexation problem.

He felt that if the legislators concentrated on just these issues it would be enough for them to handle this session. The basic tenets of Feminism as I see them (comprehensive child care, fair laws covering all people, and adequate, safe medical care for all) begin at least to cover our human needs. But this attitude is a hard one to push in a society concerned with the outward mechanics of things.

There are essentially only three major areas up for work in the Colorado legislature that even begins to look like progress for feminism. One, involving the reorganization of the prison system, isn’t very far reaching at all. The other two, requests for increases of funding by the Colorado Social Services Department for their Day Care Fund and by the Family Planning Services of Colorado for expansion of their Planned Parenthood Centers, go a little deeper into our issues.

In the House of Representatives, Carl Gustafson has sponsored HB1080 and HB1081 concerning the prison reorganization. They concentrate on administrative changes in the divisions of the departments and in abolishing old departments and creating new ones. (This is the “mechanics of things” that I was talking about.) Ms. Andrikopoulos said NOW wants to see more programmatic changes instituted to give women better rehabilitative work programs and to have the women’s facilities moved from Canon City to Denver where they would have more chances to work. In the Senate, Ralph Cole introduced SB11 which goes deeper into the idea of reorganization by asking for the establishment of a diagnostic center for rape offenders. Ms. Andrikopoulos said NOW will be watching the funding on this bill closely, urging its passage.

The Family Planning Council is asking for funding to set up Planned Parenthood Clinics in towns that presently are without them. Southern Colorado is especially uncovered by Planned Parenthood. The need for women in these towns to get adequate birth control information is probably great in light of the trend of small town communities to suppress an open expression of sexuality. Not understanding the mechanics or consequences of sex can lead to a very painful and unnecessary end. People all over explore and act upon their sexuality whether or not mama and papa said it’s OK to do so. We all have the choice — I'd like to see that women have the means for carrying through their choices.

The Colorado State Social Services Department is asking for $1.2 million dollars more than this year’s estimated total expenditure of $5.3 million dollars for their Day Care Fund. That’s $6.5 million dollars and it’s to cover the care of an average of 92,016 children per month at $59.01 per month per child. This is to provide aid and incentive to low-income and AFDC parents to work and establish financial independence. The Social Services Department funds children through independent or non-profit child-care organizations. There are no state sponsored child care centers as yet in Colorado. Ms. Andrikopoulos talked highly of the Social Services practice of licensing women on welfare to open home day-care centers if they want to. They also offer basic training in nutrition and psychology to help these women meet state qualifications. If the home doesn’t have what the state deems adequate facilities, then Social Services has the State Licensing Committee come in and help implement the necessary changes. This way these women gain an income and at the same time can provide solid care for children in a home atmosphere. NOW sees these home centers as being very important in providing the kind of complete care needed by children. They’re working for the whole child as well as the whole woman. Ms. Andrikopoulos told me about a home center she visited in Greeley. She said, “The love in that center was beautiful. I bet it costs her (the woman who heads it) money at the end of every month.” But the woman cares and the people involved put in long hours towards keeping the center running. The impetus behind this center is the change that came for the parents. When they were free to work and able to earn an adequate income to pay their bills, provide food and clothing for their children, they could finally feel their independence and self-worth. This brought a change in their children. When their parents felt good, they could feel good. Ms. Andrikopoulos said “more legislators need to know what's happening here. More people need to see what can happen when help is given in the right direction. We've become so depersonalized and unfeeling that we can’t see one another.”

On the national level I found a little more to be happening, both pro and con, for feminism. Senate Bill 2101, Title III has passed the senate and is now in the House Banking and Currency Committee. This bill is to end discrimination by credit companies based on an individual’s sex hopefully making it easier for women to obtain financial credit on our own. Unlike two similar bills proposed in Colorado (HB 1128 and HB 1129), this bill still includes the stipulation that discrimination cannot be based upon a person’s marital status. This is important in that single, divorced or widowed women are looked upon as even greater financially sound without a man behind her name.

Even though the marital status section was amended it’s important to note that they were the first bills NOW has ever lobbied for in Colorado and both were passed. I learned that the chairperson of the HB & C Committee is Lenore Sullivan who is definitely not a feminist. There may be problems in getting SB 2101 out of her committee and we are urged to write our representatives supporting this bill without amendment.

What I found interesting is the Flexible Hours Employment Act (SB 2022) introduced by Senator John Tunney (D-Cal.). The bill would require within five years of its passage that ten percent of the positions in every level in every executive agency of the federal government be made available on a part-time basis - part-time being defined as either four hours per work day or one to four days per work week. A flexible hours job is one which is a permanent responsible position with standard civil service protections and prorated fringe benefits. Senator Tunney declared that the bill would help “end the discrimination, particularly against women with children imposed by the basic pattern of working hours in our society.” NOW feels that the bill could especially benefit parents in leaving both free to contribute to the raising of their children and to the income of their family.

The Right to Life Committee is really moving in Washington. Ms. Andrikopoulos said the committee is introducing amendments to any funding bill they can to prohibit the use of any federal monies for abortions. This is after the Supreme Court has ruled laws prohibiting abortions to be unconstitutional. A woman now has the right to choose abortion or not, but the Right to Life Committee is insisting that poverty-level women still get the shaft because they don't have the resources to pay for an abortion. So out comes the closet abortion, deadly for any woman. The committee was successful in attaching such an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973. Fortunately (though they would like it to be otherwise), federal funds can still be used to dispense contraceptives. Last year, just before the Social Security Act Amendments were going to the conference committee, Senator James Buckley (C-NY) introduced section 193 to the act reading “None of the funds under title 19 (Medicaid) may be used for the performance of abortions.”

Senator Buckley went on to say “that if Congress felt that federal funds ought not to be used abroad on abortions on foreign women, then at least we could accord the same protection to our own women.” The amendment was agreed to by voice vote with no hearings or even discussion on the senate floor. The Right to Life Committee is also working hard for a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal by guaranteeing the life of the fetus from the moment of conception. I agree the life of a fetus is precious if it’s created in love. The pain of an unloved child is too great. Until we have the means, physically and spiritually, to provide birth control to every woman, I feel there’s a need to keep abortion as an option for any woman who chooses it. It would be a real waste of energy if we had to face the question of legal abortions again. Let your legislators know that you support the Supreme Court Decision of January 22, 1973. Finally, The Equal Rights Amendment is here. Two more states ratified it last year, leaving 6 of the 38 states needed to make it a constitutional amendment. There’s a good chance it will go through this year. The ERA brought together a lot of different groups that have never worked with one another before. This gives us a good basis for making a strong coalition in the future on other issues.

Lastly, NOW will be concentrating on rape this year. There will be a kick-off coalition meeting March 2 at the United Way Auditorium at 1375 Delaware. It's open to the public and the conference is scheduled the full day from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m."

Women and Jobs: An Uneasy Marriage

Randi Lornell

I work as a high school social studies teacher. The other day the
librarian brought me a new filmstrip project on “The Changing Role
of Women” to review. Those things are always pretty impressive: they
quote Shirley Chisholm, and show Indira Gandhi, and talk to women
who are doing wild and woolly jobs, and interview female lawyers and
professors. As I watched it, I thought, wow, isn’t this terrific, and in

such a few short years...

Then I walked down the hall to ask the female aide to do some
typing and get some food from the female cafeteria staff. Before I
went to see the male vice principal, who referred me to the male
principal... Hey, if all these changes have happened, like that neat
filmstrip showed, how come I don’t see any in my life?

And so I decided to find out what really has changed for employed

women in Denver.

Here is a test, class. Answer
the following multiple choice
question (there is one best
answer): “Women in the feder-
al government have made:

1. great progress

2. some progress

3. very little progress

4. less than no progress:
they’ve gone backwards.”

Depending on what informa-
tion you look at, any of these
could be correct. For instance,
in 1968, 16.9% of all supervisors
were women; by 1972, this was
down to 13.6%. But overall, the
best answer is no, 2. What's
more, there is general optimism
that over the next few years, no.
1 will replace it.

There are a great number of
different groups advocating wo-
men’s rights in the federal
government. Perhaps the most
effective are the departments’
Federal Women’s Programs, the
operating arms of which are the
Federal Women's Project Com-
mittees. Two of their functions
seem particularly promising.
One is the supervision of their
department's Affirmative Action
plan (which, in terms of the
feds, means how to get women
out of clerical and into profes-
sional positions). The other is
the setting up of various task
forces to look into specific
issues and make solid recom-
mendations. Undoubtedly,
each federal department's FWPC
has its own particular interest.
But all have the overriding
concern of how to move women
ahead. Granted, the affirmative
action plans will hopefully deal
with this; but in the meantime,
the committees themselves are
acting. In January of this year,
for example, the Civil Service
Commission's FWPC under its
coordinator Doris Veeden spon-
sored a three-day seminar called
Reach for Success, devoted to
helping secretaries and para-
professionals learn how to move to
the management level. More
than 300 people attended, of
whom 7 or 8 were men. The
workshop proved so popular
that another was held in early
February. Significantly, most of
the employing agencies both
granted release time and paid for
interested employees to attend.

Will Gains Result?

Will concrete gains result?
From 1968 to 1972, the per-
centage of women in grades 9-12
(management level) went from
8% to 11.1%; in grade 13 and up
(the highest), from 1.8% to
3.1%. Those are, in my mind,
miniscule gains. But Veeden
believes “we will see a lot of
advancement in the next 4-5
years.”

In a different vein, the FWPC
within HEW is working with the
Denver Police Department on
developing a self-defense pro-
gram. Like all projects in the
department's FWPCs, the self-
defense idea was suggested by
women in the department.
There are no directives coming

down from either Secretary
Weinberger or the Big Man
himself.

While the success of the

FWPCs will be decided by the
activity and determination of
the women themselves, the pro-
gram is sponsored by the govern-
ment. The woman elected by
her fellow female employees to
be coordinator of her depart-
ment’s committee is relieved of
some of her other duties. In
other words, the government in
effect hires a part-time coordina-
tor for each department. And
luckily, in Denver, several wo-
men interviewed emphasize that
the regional director here, who
has the real power, is “really
committed” to women moving
ahead.

Women in the federal govern-
ment have also organized on
their own, apart from the
government-sponsored FWP.
About five years ago, FEW
(Federally Employed Women),
Inc. was formed on a nationwide
basis to end sex discrimination
within the federal government.
Frankly, one gets a feeling of
“Potomac fever” in talking with
some of their people — “in
Washington they’re really doing
a lot, but you know, well, out
here, well...”

Well, it’s a little hard to see
that they're doing much of
anything out here. Last year
FEW’s year-long project was to
educate women about the af-
firmative action plans so women
could learn how to take advan-
tage of their new opportunities.
This year they’re checking on
the agencies’ AA plans and soon
will see if the agencies are really

following through on them.
They “put pressure on” — but
offer no specifics as to how
that’s done or even what it
means. More tangibly, FEW is
active in helping some women
who have brought sex discrimin-
ation cases within the federal
government, both through the
internal grievance procedures
and into court.

FEW claims that because they
are recognized by management
and can carry on activities on
clock time, and because they
can focus unfavorable publicity
on practices they don’t like,
they are successful. Yet their
leaders also apologize for having
few (no pun) members, and even
fewer young ones. They men-
tion that the union movement is
where things are really going to
happen. It leaves one a bit
skeptical.

Universities are supposed to
be the liberal bastions of the
society, or at least that’s their
image. If you take what's

happening in women’s struggle
for equality as an indication,
however, that ain’t the way it’s
working.

Any organization with more
than 50 employees that has a
contract with the federal govern-
ment or gets federal funds must
not discriminate in employment.
For many large employers in-
cluding educational institutions,
this has meant drawing up
affirmative action plans that will
ensure equal treatment in hiring
and firing as well as in promo-
tions. DU’s sounds good, and on
the principle that you should
always praise before you con-
demn, we'll look at that first.

The Affirmative Action Ad-
visory Board (AAAB) at the
university is set up to monitor
and analyze how women and
racial minorities are doing in
each department, to set goals,
and to work with those depart-
ments that are not actively
trying to meet equal employ-
ment goals. The head of the
AAAB must affirm every open-
ing (i.e., you can’t hire your
friends without telling anybody
else about the job).

In addition, there is a Com-
mittee for Women on Campus
(CWC) that was started about
three years ago by faculty
members concerned about work-
ing conditions. The CWC has
also always included students
and staff.

Stuck in Boring Positions

This year, the committee is
emphasizing the problems of
clerical staff. And here, again, is
the familiar refrain that begins to
get old the 43rd time
you hear it: women are stuck in
dead-end boring positions, with
little chance to move into
professional or management pos-
itions. Women are paid less,
largely because they are put in
jobs with “smaller” titles. And
the eternal problem: how do
you prove these things are due
to discrimination, and how do
you do something to change
them? The CWC is meeting with
the vice chancellor, personnel
director, and the AAAB in
March to “discuss” them.

To my question, asked con-
tinually to both AAAB and
CWC people, what real progress
has been made, came always the
same answer: nothing tangible
yet, but we're working on it.

There are undoubtedly a
multitude of reasons for the
stagnation, some peculiar to DU.
But one is common to us
all, though particularly severe to
educational establishments right
now: jobs are tight. You can’t
hire women, or minorities, when
there are no jobs to hire them
for. And no one is likely to get
all fired up and militant when
being fired will probably mean
going on unemployment com-
pensation.

So the women of DU plod
along, going to committee meet-
ings, hoping that eventually
something, in the economy at
large and/or within the universi-
ty, will crack. But it’s going to
be a wait.

That’s no Lady—That’s Ma Bell

Trying to find out what's going on to improve employment for women at the Big Lady is like talking to a white-sheathed maiden about abortion. You feel like she doesn't know what you're talking about, but she’s offended anyway.

A good portion of Mountain Bell's employees are women, and a union is supposed to represent the workers, right? Well, Karen Vannoy, the Traffic Vice President of the Communications Workers of America, doesn’t know of any women’s group within the company (there is one, albeit run by management), and makes it quite clear that her union represents both male and female workers and it would be inappropriate to talk about women specifically. The end.

There was a NOW member working with Mountain Bell, but she got so discouraged she hasn’t done anything for the last six or eight months.

Yet something is happening there. At the suggestion of the Vice President General Manager (a male and the top Colorado executive of the company) after a NOW presentation, a Women's Advisory Board was set up. Headed by Connie Brage, a personnel supervisor, the WAB works in a number of different areas. In terms of employment, it seems to be largely concerned so far with getting female representation on important committees that affect job training and promotion, and expediting job discrimination complaints (actually handled by the Equal Employment Opportunity coordinator). It has also designed a project to help move women into non-traditional (i.e., “male”) higher paying jobs; which “for all intents has been approved.” In other areas involving working conditions for women, Mountain Bell seems to be moving very slowly. Although she has for some years granted maternity leaves for up to a year with an equal job guaranteed upon return, she will probably agree to paid maternity leave only when a final irrevocable court decision is in. (There are several cases in the courts now.) Also, although she looked into day care, it seems that that's just not in the stars for the near future, for various reasons.

It's hard for me to believe that with all those women running around at the phone company, their only organization is a management-sponsored board. I keep thinking there must be some groups that I just haven't been able to discover that are really trying to do something about their employment.

Are any of you out there?

Private Industry: If a Mouse Roars, Can a Lion Squeak?

The first law of capitalism, as we all learn in week one of economics, is profit. The second law is that change does not, in the short run, maximize profit. Those two sentences summarize what is happening in private industry, for the most part. “All this women’s lib stuff” just does not end up in a bookkeeper’s ledger as a great plus, if you're going for this quarter or this year instead of the long pull.

But, like with Mountain Bell, there are rays of light here. About two years ago, Samsonite got together some interested people in industry to form the Affiliates of Affirmative Action. This group meets either monthly or bimonthly to share knowledge and programs with each other about the status of both minorities and women. It seems hard to pin down what they have actually accomplished, but perhaps it is indicative of a change in attitude. (As an aside, Samsonite also looked into starting a day care center at about the same time. It may be a firm to watch.)

Maybe it would have been more accurate to say “photons” rather than “rays” of light. Great Western Sugar, which is a member of Affiliates, was able to name me five women in positions of any leadership at all, and these included the secretary to the president and a “girl” accountant. One of the five had come to her job in the last year, hardly an indication that GW has made a dramatic new commitment to advancing women. My searches located no industry-sponsored day care, although the Child Care Project at CU Med Center has received “10 or 12” serious requests for help in this area. What change has come and will come to private enterprise is almost entirely due to the federal government. The terms “affirmative action,” “Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,” and “federal contract compliance” have been mentioned earlier; they now should be explained fully.

The halcyon days of the early ‘60s saw the first important legislation in the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which became effective in 1964, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Together these outlawed discrimination in both employment and wages. In 1965 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was created to “persuade” employers to obey the law. Of course, we all know how effective persuasion is in affecting the law of profit (watch Nixon persuade the oil companies to hold down prices); for several years, EEOC was little more than a gadfly. Then in 1972, strengthened by the power to bring class action suits, EEOC won the historic ATT case, in which the phone company was ordered to pay more than $30,000,000 in back wages to women employees. For reasons best known to itself, Congress saw fit at that time to pass the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. This had two important effects. One was to increase EEOC’s budget by $12,000,000, with which it was able to hire more excellent lawyers. In addition, the law empowers the EEOC to attack patterns of discrimination in specific industries, with the review of statistics as a critical tool, a precedent set in the ATT case. Hence, since March of 1972, we have had a federal agency with the power and money to enforce the employment laws.

Less than a month before Richard Nixon was first voted into the White House, President Johnson's Executive Order 11246 went into effect. This order “prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, as well as on race, color, religion, or national origin, by federal contractors or subcontractors and contractors who perform work under a federally assisted construction contract exceeding $10,000.” Now every employer of more than 50 people can be reviewed by one of the 20 agencies of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance. (For example, the airlines are regulated by the office in FAA, banks by Treasury, DOW Chemical by AEC, etc.) It is the OFCC that is responsible for the affirmative action plans, by which employers must set up goals and methods of increasing employment of minorities and women. As could be expected, the OFCC agencies in Denver have concentrated on the large employers: IBM, Honeywell, Western Electric, and several banks are among those who have shown some improvement through the efforts of OFCC. Unfortunately, the office in Denver does not have current figures to show exactly what gains have been made.

Getting private industry to accept social change is like persuading high school students that “they gotta do their homework.” It goes over only with either a veiled or present threat of the stick. As employed women, we are lucky to have the federal government's Office of Contract Compliance to urge preventative action, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for punitive measures. Hopefully it need not be pointed out that law enforcement is always a selective process. It is important to elect politicians whose priorities in the law lie with equal employment.

Day Care Makes a Tentative Beginning

The bread and butter issues of employment — who's being hired for what jobs at what salary — are obviously of primary importance. But anybody who’s ever worked knows that the fringe benefits and working conditions are also terribly important in the day-to-day living at the job. For women, the question of what to do with the kids while you're at home looms today as probably the greatest job-related concern.

In this area, Denver is far behind other sections of the nation, particularly the East and Far West. As well as I could ascertain, only two employer-related day care centers are currently operating: one at the CU Medical Center (the older of the two), the other at the Federal Center on West 6th Avenue. As stated before, the Med Center Child Care Project has received about a dozen serious requests for help in starting centers, and several companies looked into the idea before dropping it.

To understand the problems involved in getting an industry day care center going, it is illuminating to look at how the Med Center managed theirs, and why the Chalet Child Center, planned for the Greenwood Plaza area, has floundered.

The story of the Child Care Project will stir any feminist’s heart — nay, the heart of any activist, of whatever sex. For it is a story of folks getting together over a common need and winning. In early 1972, a group of women formed a committee to try to found a day care center. In a shrewd move that some of us might learn something from, they rounded up some smart people who already knew what day care was about. They proceeded to set up model services: a day care center and a system of satellite family day care homes (personal homes recruited to take several children, to whom they gave help, loaned toys and equipment, and relieved for ½ day a month). The Med Center group then wrote a grant proposal, submitted it to HEW’s Office of Child Development, received approval in June, and started flying. The project is now involved in both classical research on day care and its demonstration model. Nice story, isn’t it?

Too bad the other story isn’t so rosy. In fact, it is abominable.

The Chalet Child Center is the brainchild of Mimi Wegrzyn, an experienced teacher and community action worker. When Ms. Wegrzyn arrived here with her husband, she looked for a job in her field. When she realized the futility of that, she started on the day care merry-go-round. Before long, two facts hit her in the face: many kennels in Denver offer better facilities than do many day care centers; and Greenwood Plaza, employing many young mothers as well as fathers, had no facilities whatsoever. And so she began.

Several months and at least $7,000 later (fees for engineering surveys, etc.), the Chalet Child Center remains a good idea. It has recently been rejected by the Arapahoe City Commission for not conforming to zoning regulations. The plan will have to be revised and resubmitted.

Who has $7,000 sitting around to even apply for a permit for a center? In addition, Colorado law has stringent regulations requirements for new day care centers — but they don’t apply to those already in existence. How will the new centers, which will obviously cost much more to conform to the rules, compete with the established ones that can continue business as usual?

The Med Center's project has federal funds. The one at the Federal Center is run by private people eligible for Small Business Administration loans. With costs what they are, will any employers be able to supply day care without governmental subsidies?

To Conclude: I Don’t Know Where That Filmstrip Got Its Information, But It Wasn’t Here

There is no question that things on the women’s employment front are moving. Government, education, industry, do have affirmative action plans. You do see those revealing percentage points moving upwards, slowly, slowly. Women are joining together to fight for improvement in hiring, upward mobility, and child care, as well as issues such as self-defense that they feel affect them particularly. And this article has certainly not been exhaustive in covering what’s happening; rather, it has sought to highlight. Finally, space has not permitted mentioning such groups as the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the Colorado Commission on the Status of Women, or Better Jobs for Women, all of which are among those doing important work in this field.

Yet none of that can hide the inescapable fact that for the overwhelming majority of employed women, things have not tangibly changed. Most of us are not Great Western’s “woman chemist in Loveland,” nor are we among the 59 women out of 1,928 highest paid employees in federal government in Colorado, nor does our employer provide day care nearby.

Over and over comes the refrain: “over the next four or five years...” and “tremendous strides really are being taken...” and “women power is just coming into its own...” Can it be believed? The question is irrelevant. Whatever the prognosis, women have only one choice: to keep on plugging, working for the small gains, and working, and working, and working: in their places of employment, in politics, and in unions."

re Were Where We’ve Been  

Some people think of Denver  
as a place to stop in between the  
West Coast and Chicago. But for  
most of us, Denver is our home,  
our work, and our interest.  
Consequently, and in keeping  
with the theme of this month’s  
issue, “The Women’s Movement  
in Colorado,” Big Mama Rag  
decided to seek out the ideas  
and feelings of local feminists.  
Exploring the personal and theo-  
retical issues of Feminism is a  
priority for the present Women’s  
Movement, and BMR hopes to  
provide a forum for a continuing  
exploration. We realize that the  
following opinions do not ex-  
press a true cross-section of the  
Feminist consciousness in Colo-  
rado, but offer it as a beginning,  
and plan to print articles similar  
to this one again in the future.  
The women interviewed in the  
following article have all been  
active in the Women’s Move-  
ment for several years, and  
identify themselves as Feminists.  
To simplify the process of  
reporting, we asked everyone  
the same three questions: 1)  
Explain who you are and what  
led to your involvement in the  
Women’s Movement; 2) Present-  
ly, how do your Feminist views  

and philosophy affect your life?  

(Job, school, ambitions, rela-  
tionships); and 3) What do you  
feel are the most significant  
future priorities for Feminists?  

JACKIE BRYSON  

My first intellectual awareness  
of some of the issues of the  
Women’s Movement came in  
1963, when I read The Feminine  
Mystique. I considered it my  
Bible for several years, but had  
no one with whom to share it. I  
filed it away in my personality  
under “Anger.”  

In the Fall of 1969 a friend of  
mine, traveling from Boston to  
Washington, D.C., visited me for  
a weekend, and brought with  
her the Feminist writings of the  
Bread and Roses women’s group  
in Boston. These writings  
contained the beginnings of a  
real Feminist consciousness for  
me — concepts of sisterhood,  
and a woman’s culture, and  
relationships that were not  
power-structured. I was a public  
school teacher at the time, and,  
within a month, organized a CR  
group with the librarian at our  
school. For me, this was the real  
beginning. I had sisters.  

Being in New York, I had the  
opportunity to trail behind  
some radical groups, attending  
conferences, seminars, etc.,  
attentively, but at a safe  
non-threatening distance. After  
all, I had a family. Those women  
were free.  

I lived in Berkeley the  
following year, and spent a lot  
of time at the women’s center  
there. Again, I found warm,  
independent women. I was  
attracted by their strength, by  
their sense of beauty of  
themselves. One Friday night I  
was attending a meeting about  
Angela Davis at the women’s  
center. I was nine months  
pregnant at the time, and still  
believe the woman-force in that  
room awoke my sleepy baby.  

My labor began there, and my  
daughter was born the next day.  

In 1971 I moved to Denver  
and sought out a women’s group  
at once. I was welcomed into a  
CR group as if they'd all been  
waiting for me. We celebrated  
the joys of sisterhood. We  
taught each other what we  
knew. We drew, we painted, we  
sculpted, we photographed each  
other. We danced, we hugged,  
we sang. We believed we could  
do anything. We loved what  
made us different from men. We  
discovered the power of being  
women — of being women  
together. I am still in touch with  
most of these women, who now  
look back on that group  
experience as having been a  
“once-in-a-lifetime”  
life-changing event.  

Presently, my Feminist  
philosophy affects my life as  
follows: 1) I appreciate being a  
mother. I think it is my greatest  
life experience. 2) I am in  
process. I am still giving birth to  
myself. I have a lot to learn. 3)  

I can’t do everything. I had to  
join the forces of women  
asserting that I could do  
everything in order to do  
anything. Reality sets in  
quickly. I know I can’t do  
everything. Right now I want to  
study law and am pursuing that.  
I still can’t fix my car, I don’t  
know karate. I hate plumbing.  
But I don’t have to do any or all  
of those things at once. I can  
choose. I think women do a  
disservice to themselves and  
each other by claiming (for very  
long) that they can do  
everything. Assess situations  
realistically. Know what you can  
do and do it: Never lie to  
yourself. 4) I’ll fight for what I  
want. I’ll protect myself and  
those I love. As Flo Kennedy  
says: “The time has come for  
kickin’ ass and takin’ names.”  

The most significant future  
priorities for Feminists? I’m not  
sure. What I see around me are  
women struggling for  
recognition, for personal  
satisfaction, for some real work.  
Men have called these issues  
“human” problems. I see them as  
women’s mandate. What can we  
really do collectively if we are  
half-baked individuals? Women  
must attend to themselves, but  
not only to themselves. The  
Women’s Movement can be, and  
I fear, will be co-opted (bought  
off). The flagrant injustices are  
likely to be ameliorated by the  
system's reforming itself. It is  
the responsibility of Feminists  
to see to it that Feminist  
Consciousness imposes itself on  
the world, as a Mother would  
impose her values on her family.  
Women in positions of  
leadership have a special  
responsibility in this regard —  
reform must not lull us to sleep.  
We must keep the country aware  
that we are not talking about  
reform as it has been defined  
before, or mere self-interest. We  
are talking about  
evolutionary-revolutionary  
changes in human consciousness  

— about sweeping political  
change, about values, about  
reversing priorities, about  

matriarchy. Obviously, there is  
little moral leadership in this  
country. Doing what one can  
and maintaining one’s integrity  
is no more essential than  
creating changes in  
consciousness, and being there  
when the times are right.  
Wherever you are.  

But, like when you're  
baking bread, there are things  
that can be done while you're  
waiting for the yeast to grow.  
For me, these priorities are: not  
backing down, keeping in touch  
with other women around the  
country and with what they're  

thinking, building solid  
relationships with many kinds of  
women, learning women's  
culture, and loving  
children.  

BONITA TRUMBLE  

I first became involved with  
the Women’s Movement in 1969  
when I attended the Second  
Annual Congress to Unite  
Women in New York City. I was  
already politically active in  
Philadelphia, but this new (to  
me) movement was obviously an  
answer to a lack in my life. The  
two women with whom I had  
attended the conference and I  
rushed back to Philadelphia. We  
called all of our women friends  
together to turn them on to  
what we had learned, and a CR  
group was born.  

Shortly thereafter, I learned  
of WITCH (Women’s  
International Terrorist  
Conspiracy from Hell), and this  
women’s group with its flair for  
theater and art, its positive  
emphasis on women’s values,  
and its unique sense of humor  
was clearly the way for me to  
express myself. Through the  

help of Robin Morgan, I  
organized a chapter of WITCH  
in Philadelphia. These two  

activities culminated in the first  
Women’s Conference held in the  
Philadelphia area. It was held in  
March of 1970 and was attended  
by over 300 women.  

I came to Denver in the Fall  
of 1971, and during 1972 I was  
the Associate Producer of  
“Anatomy of Woman” at  
KRMA-TV. This ten-week series  
took a look at today’s woman,  
her life, and the issues  
confronting her.  

I am currently the director of  
Sebastian House, an alternative  
school for young people aged  
(0-18). I feel that working with  
young people is a viable way of  
effecting change in society.  

Obviously, a first priority is  
the passage of the Equal Rights  
Amendment. It is absurd in this  
day and age, in this country (or  
any country) that equal rights  
should be denied to anyone.  
Second, women must begin to  
make paths into all kinds of  
previously male-dominated areas  
- medicine, law, politics, the  
arts, science, government, etc. It  
is especially important for those  
of us working with youth to  
urge bright young females as  
well as males into these areas.  
Third, and maybe most  
important, Feminists must begin  
to take their role as women  
seriously. For a long time we  
have felt that we must gain the  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 6  

male concept of power in order  
to succeed. We won't change  
things by becoming the  
aggressors - by perpetuating the  
power trip of one group of  
people over another. Now is the  
time for the true nature of  
woman, the real basis of the  
strength women have always had  
to come forth. A first step is to  
ask ourselves: What is  
essentially woman? Is it  
patience? Understanding?  
Love? Armed with answers to  
this basic question, we will  
understand ourselves better, and  
this understanding will enable us  
to make better use of our  
strengths. The Women's  
Movement has already had a  
tremendous impact on this  
country and we’ve only just  
begun!  

I am employed by the State  
of Colorado as Supervisor of  
Case Handling and Investigations  
for the Colorado Civil Rights  
Commission. The commission  
enforces laws which prohibit  
discrimination in employment,  
housing and places of public  
accommodation based on race,  
creed, color, sex, national origin  
and ancestry and, in the case of  
housing, marital status and  
religion. I have been with the  
commission almost nine years,  
and have seen its development  
from no involvement with sex  
discrimination cases to one of  
such cases presently constituting  
one-third of its case load.  

I am a Charter Member of the  
Denver branch of the National  
Organization for Women and  
have attended two of its  
national conferences. I have  
been Employment Task Force  
Chairperson and have made  
many public appearances, either  
for NOW or for the Civil Rights  
Commission, speaking on  
Women and Employment.  

I have been concerned with  
all forms of discrimination most  
of my life. I was an active  
member of the American  
Association of University  
Women in California and in  
Boulder for many years. Just  
prior to joining the Civil Rights  
Commission, I took graduate  
work in social psychology at  
CU, where I conducted research  
relating women’s roles to  
personal values and child-rearing  
attitudes. This work led me to  
some in-depth investigation of  
women's roles, problems, and  
developmental stages - thinking  
that was a forerunner of the  
present Women’s Movement.  

Fortunately my views are  
most relevant to my job. I find  

that I was brainwashed  
concerning behavior towards  
supervisors, but my Feminist  

philosophies are helping that  
problem. I have always insisted  
that I had rights - hence I went  

More on Page 7"
BigMammaRag,2,6,,8,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol2No6_page008.txt,"ELEANOR GISH CROW

back to do graduate work before  
it was fashionable and with  
criticism from many women. I  
am anxious to let women see the  
ways in which male chauvinist  
philosophy permeates our world  

so that they too can do  
something about it. I believe  
that I brought up my two  

daughters to be Feminists, or at  
least to value their importance  
as individuals, and to plan  
careers for themselves. My older  
daughter is just finishing law  
school at CU. My younger  
daughter graduated from  
Oberlin College last May and is  
now studying violin seriously in  
New York City with the goal of  
a musical career. My husband  
has accepted some role reversals  
- having volunteered to take over  
the washing and ironing. He is  
now partially retired, which has  
brought about some other  
changes in my attitudes towards  
traditional roles.

I think that the priority for  
the future must be to open up  
the employment world fully so  
that women will no longer be  
“cheap labor” and exploited.  
This requires that back-up  
services be provided for women  
with young children - day-care  
centers and innovative methods  
of allowing two persons to share  
one full-time position.

CAROL HOUSE

I have been involved in the  

Women’s Movement for a few —  

years now, and during that time  
my activities have changed a  
great deal. My goal, in terms of  
women’s rights, is to obtain full  
economic, political, and social  
rights for women. Two years ago  
I thought that the Women’s  
Movement was a revolutionary  
vanguard movement. I saw  
sexual oppression and sex  
discrimination as the primary  
oppression that was common to  
the masses of people in this  
country and the world. I called  
myself a Radical Feminist.

Since that time, I have moved  
away from active participation  
in many women’s groups,  
including Big Mama Rag and am  
now working mostly in mixed  
political groups. I still believe  

that the end to sex  
discrimination and the  
attainment of full democratic  
rights for women is in the  

interests of the broad masses of  
the people, but I do not think  
that the present Women’s  
Movement can attain these goals!  

Although  
the women’s movement has  
been instrumental in raising the  
issue of the oppression of  
women as a group, the  
over-emphasis on such issues as  
“sexual freedom,” abortion, and  
an anti-male/anti-marriage/  
anti-family attitude has turned  
away many third world and  
working class women who are  
concerned primarily with issues  
which concretely affect their  

lives - such as equal pay for  
equal work, their double  
oppression as Third World  

women, day care, welfare rights,  
housing issues, etc. - I no longer  
see that sexual oppression is the  
primary oppression which  
women suffer. I see that our  
society is a class society and that  
therefore all working people  
suffer economic oppression. The  
major contradiction is not  
between men and women, but  
between workers and capitalists.  
Sexism is only one of the tools  
that the capitalist (or ruling)  
class uses to oppress people who  
have to work for their living.  
Another glaring example is  
racism. These methods are  
employed to create divisions  
between workers and pit one  
against another. I see sexism as  
part of a larger class struggle in  
which all working people, men  
and women alike, must join  
together for the betterment of  
all. This is not to say that  
women should push aside issues  
of sexism, but that sexism must  
be dealt with in a constructive  
way, keeping in mind who the  
enemy really is. The enemy is  
not men in general, it is the  
economic and political system  
which encourages and practices  
racism and sexism.

I think that the Women’s  
Movement must speak to these  
issues more forcefully and more  
persistently, and must learn to  
speak to the concrete,  
immediate, and practical needs  
of working women. In addition  
the Women’s Movement must  
learn to develop an overall  
political and economic analysis  
of this society.

I am a woman who has carried  
a sense of the way the world  
should be from a very young  
age. I have never enjoyed the  
inferior status relegated to me as  
a girl or as a woman. I have  
always been a rebel, a tomboy, a  
“cocky bitch,” because I have  
never accepted the role my  
family and culture have prepar-  
ed for me.

I had been searching for many  
years for a word to describe the  
ideas and feelings I've had. After  
two years in the left, fighting for  
primarily male-dominated  
causes, I joyously discovered the  

word Feminism.

I found strength and stimulus  
in other women who were  
coming to the same realizations  
as I, and we formed one of the  
first women’s groups in Carbon-  
dale, (IL). We were primarily a CR  
group, but because of the  
political upheaval on the South-  
ern Illinois University campus  
that spring, we had to learn to  
trust each other in crisis situa-  
tions. Experiences such as riots,  

MAUREEN MRIZEK

a police raid, tear gas bombings,  
and even jail forced me to really  

depend on and trust other  
women.  
After moving to Denver, I  

found that some Feminists here  
had not undergone the same  
kind of “shock” program I had.  
Although the intellectual theo-  
ries we shared were similar, the  
gut feelings and the trust in one  
another were very restrained.

Nevertheless, I sought out  
women who were acting to  
express their guerilla theatre and  
found that to be a very invigor-  
ating experience. My activism  
produced such an incredible  
amount of energy and enthusi-  
asm that I became involved in  
many different Feminist acti-  
vities. One of the most note-  
worthy is this newspaper. Big  
Mama Rag has been and will be  
a source of pride and encourage-  
ment for me.

Feminism is responsible in  
many ways for the way I view  
myself and other women. I am  
proud of being a woman, proud  
of the potential I’ve developed  
and the potential I see in other  
women. I enjoy being with  
women, I think we’re beautiful.  
I love the energy and intensity  
women create with each other.  
Feminism has opened my eyes  
to the possibilities of seriously  
pursuing a career in law or  
music, or both. And when I say  
serious, I mean that; a half-assed  
attempt will not do for me  
anymore. Feminism has made  
me take myself seriously.

Feminism affects the way I  
relate to other women because I  
have learned to analyze the  
dynamics of a relationship and  
hopefully move toward an egali-  
tarian goal. Being a Lesbian, I  
find my Feminism both a  
positive and negative force.  
Many Lesbians do not under-  
stand, or care to understand,  
Feminism and tend to relate to  
women in the same ways men  
relate to women. This evokes  
the same anger in me that  
sexism coming from men does.  
On the other hand, my Femin-  
ism — when I relate to other  
Lesbian/Feminists, helps clear  
the way for a more progressive  
type of relationship.

As for future priorities I  
think we should institutionalize  
Feminism. No, not in a mental  
ward; we should create our own  
institutions which will enable us  
to develop and be the most  
complete and creative people we  
can be. When I say institutions,  
I mean things like a Feminist  
Savings and Loan Association, a  
credit union, educational funds,  
medical programs, maybe even a  
Feminist church, using Feminist  
doctrine and drawing upon mat-  
riarchal history. I want us to be  
here to stay and have the most  
force and impact we possibly  
can have on the culture we're  
here to change.

FERN GAPIN

I have been politically active  

since 1969, when I became  
chairwoman of the Boulder  
Student Mobilization  

Committee, the largest anti-war  
group in Colorado. In 1970, the  
year that I joined the Young  
Social Alliance (YSA), I was  
active in the Boulder Women’s  
Liberation Coalition, and helped  
to found “Coloradoans Against  
All Abortion Laws,” which later  
became the Mountain States  
Women's Abortion Coalition  
(MSWAC). In 1972, I ran on the  
Socialist Workers Party ticket  

for U.S. House of  
Representatives in District 1.  
Presently, I am an active  
member of the Student  
Women’s Coalition and the  
Farmworker’s Support  

Committee at Metropolitan  
State College, where I am a  
student. I’m also on the  
Executive Committee of the  
Denver Young Socialist  
Alliance. When I realized that the  
goals of Feminism could not be  
achieved in this society - that  
capitalism, with its  
overwhelming drive for profits  
and its built-in exploitation,  
actually requires the oppression  
of women - I became a Socialist  
as well as a Feminist. I joined  
YSA, a revolutionary socialist  
youth organization, and two  
years later, I joined the Socialist  
Workers Party. My political  
activity is the most important  
part of my life. Changing this  
society into a humane, socialist  
society where women, and all  
other oppressed groups will be  
able to achieve real liberation  
has top priority for me. I see  
myself being involved in  
Feminist activities up until,  
during, and after the socialist  
revolution.

There are certain priorities  
which have risen organically out  
of the Women’s Movement  
demands for 24-hour  
community-controlled child  
care, equal job and educational  
opportunities, and women’s  
control of their bodies. I think  
one of another of these demands  
will be at the center of my  
struggles that develop with a  
Feminist focus. Right now, the  
fight for passage of the Equal  
Rights Amendment is very  
important, requiring active  
support from the entire  
Women’s Movement. A very  
exciting “new” development,  
which is really the continuation  
of past, unfinished struggles, is  
the organization of trade union  
women. A new, younger,  
Feminist leadership is now  
stepping forward in the union  
movement. I am certain that we  
will see developments like this  
occurring on a massive scale in  
the future.

KAREN MARINIACE

I have worked as a social  
worker and a therapist in  
Colorado for over six years.  
Most of the time I live with  
John Marinace and our  
five-year-old son, David. I have  
been involved in the Women's  
Movement for 3½ years and  
involvement has been both  
personal and political ... I don’t  
believe I could separate the two.

In my first real CR group, I  
learned that I could care about  
other women, and began really  
caring about myself. I made  
demands in my marriage which  
allowed me more freedom and  
recognition for my strengths.  
Personally, I have felt a rebirth  

process in which I became more  

free to be myself. Politically, I  
have spoken on women’s issues  
to groups of students, ministers,  
church women, social workers,  
and psychiatrists. I entered my  
son in a Feminist day care  
effort, which grew into the Lucy  
Stone Cooperative, in which we  
worked together to raise our  
children in a non-sexist setting.

Feminism became an impor-  
tant part of my activities in the  
radical therapy movement.  
Another woman therapist and I  
started a Single Mother's Group,  
composed of young women who  
had decided to keep their  

babies, rather than to give them  

up for adoption.

I have always supported the  
activist part of the movement,  
and have taken part in  
demonstrations, speak-outs, and  

courtroom activities. I believe,  

however, that real political  
change begins within each of us.  
People begin to listen when  
discarding sex role stereotypes  
means freedom for both sexes to  
become persons. I find it  
important to confront even the  
smallest put-down or stereotype.  
Therapists must learn to treat  
their clients as persons, not as  
roles.

Sometimes it’s easier to  
maintain my own personhood at  
work or in casual relationships  
than it is at home. John and I  
have found that to be really  
separate persons sometimes we  
have to physically separate.

One of the challenges I see for  
the future is raising children in a  
nurturing non-sexist  
environment. Traditional  
marriage proves to be stifling for  
adults and children. All of the  
priorities of the Women’s  
Movement are important for  
me: women taking power,  
changing the media,  
consciousness raising, supporting  
our sisters. The most significant  
priority for me in the future is  
to find ways for people to live  
together - big people, little  
people, men and women -  
without denying the needs or  
personhood of any."

Need for Midwives,

Training Facilities

Barbara Hume

Health care for women in our
society is profoundly affected
by and connected to the general-
ly deplorable state of the U.S.
health empire. Women’s health
is further complicated by the
fact that we are unique both
because of physiology and be-
cause of the social status we
have been granted in this soci-
ety. The most blatant area has
been the takeover of the obstet-
rical and gynecological fields by
men. Historically this occurred
with the introduction of forceps
and other surgical procedures,
and concomitantly with the
realization that this was a field
where money could be made.
This is the most important area
for us to reclaim, not only for
the sake of pride, but for the
sake of better care of our
bodies.

One crucial step in the return
to medical care of women by
women is the legalization and
support of midwives. Sweden,
the Netherlands, Norway, and at
least eleven other countries do a
better job than we do of

delivering babies as judged by
such statistical measurements as
the infant mortality rate. In all
of these countries except Cana-
da, the well-trained midwife
plays a central role in childbirth
education and delivery. In the
world as a whole, 80% of babies
are delivered by midwives as
compared to 1% in this country.

Since Sweden has the lowest
infant mortality rate in the
world, I would like to quickly
review the procedure followed
there. Ninety percent of preg-
nant women make a first visit to
the doctor during the first three
months of pregnancy. If no
problems are detected, the wo-
man is assigned to a midwife

Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon,
co-authors of the book
Lesbian/Woman, will speak at
the CUDC auditorium (Room
214), 14th and Arapahoe, on
Friday, April 5th at 7:30 pm.
The event is jointly sponsored
by the Gay Coalition of Denver,

the Denver chapter of the
National Organization for
Women, and the Office of

Student Affairs at CUDC. A $1
donation is requested.

who gives careful prenatal care
with extensive teaching and
home visits. This midwife almost
always delivers the child. Mem-
branes are rarely ruptured, drugs
to induce labor are rare and
instruments are less commonly
used. Many political and social
factors influence this high sur-
vival rate, but good teaching and
care by a skilled nurse midwife
oriented toward preventive
health care is certainly one
important aspect.

In 1971, the patriarchs of our
bodies, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(only 3% women), finally recog-
nized that since 15% of residency
positions were unfilled, maybe
midwives had a place and would
not rob them of all their
substantial fees. Since that time,
every state except Colorado has
legalized midwifery though
many laws still need further
revision. A group of nurses in
this area is now working to get
an interpretation through the
State Board of Nursing and the
Nurse Practice Act which would
broaden the status of nurse
practitioners in the field of
midwifery to allow them to
fully use their extensive training.
The outcome of this should be
known by April. If the current
strategy fails, check Big Mama
Rag in May for what we can all
do to help counter the estab-
lished patriarchal, dollar-minded
system.

Once the legal right of mid-
wives to practice is finally won,
a bigger hurdle may be reversing
some of the prejudices left from
an era of untrained “grannies”
(some great, some deplorable).
We need to look at what a
midwife is today and why she

can give care not only equal to
that given by an obstetrician,
but in most cases better. So put
away any stories you heard from
your grandmother and get ready
to hear a lot more about the
kind of care women in many
countries already have access to,
and the kind of care we all need
and deserve.

One other very large problem
is going to be training. There are
currently only 1,400 American
trained midwives with only 70

new midwives graduated in 1972.
So be alert too for opportunities
to support the expansion of
training programs.

If you have information or
questions, please send them on
so we can get a dialogue going.
I'll be glad to send a good long
list of references to any of you
interested. Most important write
and let us know what you're
interested in hearing more about
or what your problems have
been in the field of women’s
health.

MSC Offers
Women's
Classes

Nancy Heine

Metropolitan State College
offers Denver Area women one
of the first local Women’s
Studies programs.

Beginning in spring, 1972 with
a class entitled ‘Women,
Feminism and Literature”, the
program has expanded to
include fourteen classes in seven
subject fields.

Both women and men
students enroll in classes which
trace women’s role from an
historic, political, psychological,
artistic or sociological point of
view.

The program, according to a
recent statement from its
director Dr. Barbara Blansett,
“is aimed at heightening
women’s awareness of
themselves as human beings,
with all the dignity and
potential inherent therein.”

The interdisciplinary courses
are designed to make students
aware that women’s “role in
today's society is based not on
biological necessity, but upon
cultural biases.”

The MSC Women’s Studies
Program is, as of fall, 1973,

under the Center for Urban
Affairs. Most of its course
offerings are listed under

Women’s Studies in the school's
catalog but a few remain listed
under various other
departments.

Six faculty members together
with six students were elected
fall quarter to democratically
decide the direction of the
program. Financing, courses,
publicity and hiring are
discussed several times during
each quarter by the Women’s
Studies Council.

The program gives three $100
Colorado Scholars’ scholarships
quarterly to students who
participate in Women’s Studies
and who are academically
qualified.

Courses to be offered in the
spring include: ""Introduction to
Women's Studies’, ‘Sociology
of Women’s Roles’, ‘Eve Image
in Literature’, “T’ai Chi
Chu’uan” and possibly “Women
in American History.”

Becky Bohannan

The Women’s Movement, be-
sides working to obtain equal
rights for women, is also trying
to educate people to the cause
in the hopes of eventually
abolishing chauvinistic views to-
ward women. In attempting to
achieve this goal, one important
group has been continually for-
gotten. No strong effort has
been made to reach high school
students. As a high school
student myself, I am naturally
more aware of this often forgot-
ten group. So during the first

week of February, I conducted a

survey at three Denver area high
schools (Aurora Central, George
Washington, and Cherry Creek),
and interviewed 127 high school
students about their views to-
ward women and the feminist
movement.

Only 23% Agree

The majority (83%) of the
students interviewed were aware
of the movement and its basic
goals. But when asked if they
agreed with these goals, only
22% said yes. Fifty-three per-
cent said they agreed with some
(generally equal pay for equal
work), and a whole 25% gave a
flat no. These statistics and
many comments such as, “Basi-
cally their goals are very sound,
yet some of these women tend
to be more zealous in reaching
these goals and so have a habit
of making asses of themselves,”
and “...I get pretty scared
sometimes not knowing what
they are going to do next!”,
demonstrate that many students
have the idea that ‘women’s
libbers’ are loud, aggressive,
wild women. A good number of
them think feminists are trying
to become superior to men.

High School Women

The women were asked if
they planned on becoming a
housewife or having a career.
Fifty percent said they wanted a
career, 32% said they wanted
both, and only 9% said they
wanted to be a housewife. Yet
when asked if they felt the
movement had affected them,
only 31% said yes.

This discrepancy was also true
with the men. When asked if
they would object to their wife
working when they marry, fully
80% answered no. But only 23%
said the movement had affected
their views toward women.

Not Aware

An explanation of this might
possibly be that high school
students ranging in age from
14-18 years old have grown up
with the movement and thus
have not been fully aware of its
effects on them. “The Feminine
Mystique” was published in 1963
and the National Organization
for Women was formed in ‘66;
the public generally became
aware of the movement by
about ‘68 or ‘69. So we were
growing up while all of these
ideas were being discussed and
debated. During our impression-
able years, women have been
vocalizing and we absorbed at
least some of what they were
saying without realizing it. If the
students interviewed had been in
high school in the fifties or even
early sixties, their answers in all
probability would have been
very different. Most of the
women would have wanted to
be a housewife and most of the
men would have objected to
their wife’s working. So there is
little doubt that the movement
has affected them.

Feminism -

High school students need to
be reached. Lately many non-
sexist children’s books have
been written, and women are
fighting school districts to get
textbooks revised. This is all
extremely necessary, but these
books are not going to affect the
current group of high school
students. They'll do wonders for
children ten to fifteen years
younger than we. But it’s
difficult to find feminists who
are trying to reach high school
people. So far the only informa-
tion high school students have
about the movement has been
supplied by the media. Of
course, a few had gone beyond
this and discovered what it’s
really all about, but the majority
have not. Thus they hold a very
distorted view of feminism and
the movement. Is the feminist
movement willing to just sit
back and watch another genera-
tion grow up with the same
chauvinistic attitudes toward
women as the last?

It’s a disturbing face when
25% of the students interviewed
still believe the male sex is
superior. It’s frustrating to hear
a woman say a feminist is
“someone who wants to be a
man but can’t ‘cause they don’t
look like one.” These views do
not have to exist. If women
involved in the struggle could
only spend a little time working
to erase such attitudes, then
possibly a few years from now if
another survey is taken, more
students when asked how they
would depict a feminist would
simply reply as one woman did,
“a woman who wants to be a
person.”

Farah Women Fight and Win

Women compose 80% of the
employees at the Farah Manu-
facturing Co. in El Paso, Texas,
mostly Mexican American wo-
men. On May 3, 1972, 3,000 of
these workers walked off their
jobs in protest of the arbitrary
firing of six organizers for the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America.

As far back as 1970, the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America won an election in
the cutting room of the Farah
Co. In 1972 the union was
recognized as the official bar-
gaining agent by the National
Labor Relations Board. Not
only did the company refuse to
bargain with the union, but they
proceeded to fire the people
who were legally organizing for
the union in other areas of the
company. This action precipitat-
ed the walk-out which has lasted
close to two years.

On Monday, January 28,
1974, another decision was hand-
ed down by Walter Maloney, a
NLRB judge. In this sweeping
decision in favor of the workers,
Maloney accuses the Farah Co.
of wholesale lawlessness and he
“grants virtually all the relief
sought by the workers and the
union.” (Denver Post, Jan. 29,
1974)

The company was ordered to
rehire the six workers and
restore all back pay since the
time of their firing.

Recently the company
agreed to a card check among the
employees. There was support
for the union by 67 percent of
those voting. Consequently, Far-
ah has recognized the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers of
America as the official bargaining
agent for the workers. The
official announcement was issued
on Sunday, February 24. The
company and the union will
negotiate a contract, and all
striking workers will be back on
their jobs in the near future. To
celebrate the success of the
strike, the Denver local of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America will be holding a
Farah Strikers Victory Rally on
Tuesday, March 19, at 7:30 p.m.
at the Laborers’ Hall, 875 Elati.
Come and join in the festivities.

Creating the Universe

Janet Sergi

How do we get away from Amerika 1974 and to a Woman's place, date unknown?

Looking at history and trying to be aware of all that is happening right now gives both a dismal and hopeful view.

In the late nineteenth century, men discovered their patriarchal God was too strict. These white men knew that this God was not conceived in their most complementary image, so they decided “God is Dead.” A new god was needed. They were it. Thus new possibilities opened up. Since there were no absolute laws to follow, everything was possible—as long as it was in the interest of white men.

What followed was the industrial revolution, leaps in man-made technology, the rape of the Earth, wars, revolutions, the new religions (Dread, Anxiety, and Despair). The white man’s soul was projected as the new God. It contained nothing. White man had reached his final peak—Absurdity.

Man is Dead

Today the White Man is dead. It is up to Woman to create the universe. She must create the values and lifestyles in keeping with her Woman soul. This soul has been forgotten by both the patriarchal God and by the male concept of Absurdity. But She lives! Man is Dead. Absurdity is Dead. Now everything is possible.

White man is nothing but the reflection of his own lack of grounding in the life processes. His energies are borrowed from his mother, the poor and the Third World communities. Man is Nothing. Man is dead. Enough of beating a dead horse. Woman must get on with their real business, that of Creation.

The energies and oneness with the natural order of things, that used to be part of childbearing, are now freed to create a fit world. A world fit for the child in all of us. A world where wonder and awareness are the prime qualities that are given social approval. A community where aggressiveness in the pursuit of beauty and love, not in competitiveness and destruction, is the mark of distinction.

Man is Dead. Women are giving birth to themselves. A Woman's place is that place within ourselves that the hopelessness and self-hate of white men could not reach. Woman’s self-hate and anxiety come from accepting the Male Culture’s definitions of her either as an ever-nurturing mother or as an incomplete existential creature with no future.

The Male Culture is Dead. The male wasteland is nowhere land. A Woman's place is the only somewhere there is. A vision of womanhood that transforms all ways of being and seeing life is what Radical Feminism is all about. All our political actions must prepare the way for externalizing our woman's soul onto the outside world.

Woman’s Revolution

We need good paying jobs to survive while we are making a woman’s revolution. But to make entry into the male capitalist economy our top political priority would be a deadly mistake.

Equal pay for equal work, like the vote, is a piece of the Amerikan pie that is basically inedible. There is no equality in a death culture. The Capitalist system is founded on the free labor of women in the household and cheap labor in the economy. To pay women for their real services is impossible in a profit motivated society.

Energies Diverted

Better jobs for women are possible only for a select few. The token woman is used by the male capitalist order to divert energies of the most aggressive woman away from making a truly humanized society. We need the best jobs and the most skills we can obtain, but our real task is making a woman’s culture that frees all members of it—not just a few.

There is no equality in a death culture; for woman to ask parity with man is to ask to be nothing, to be dead.

As my old friend used to say, “No slogans can convey my hopes, but we cannot be co-opted because we want everything.”

By Lake Circumspect

We talk about white weight, white walls, and white whales, but I still think seasonal images are only as fitting as the calendar. Otherwise, after Winter we would fade away like white light encompassing all the spectrum colors, the step beyond that and naturally we will not. Because spring is green, of course, anybody knows that.

The seedling of this whole is that the growth of these human plantlings is limited only by one’s own estimation of the circular pot at one’s feet. Beyond that, anything is possible.

Sex Preference Vote Slated

The controversial amendment to the City of Boulder’s human rights ordinance, which would prohibit job discrimination because of “sexual preference,” has been set for a referendum vote on May 7.

The amendment, which originally included a ban on discrimination on the basis of marital status and age, has been divided up by the City Council after groups opposing the “sexual preference” part of the measure began their campaign to defeat the amendment. The sections banning discrimination on the basis of age and marital status have won the approval of the City Council, but the section dealing with the civil rights of gay people will be put to a referendum vote.

Speaking at the Denver chapter of NOW’s panel on Lesbianism on March 25, Georgia Borgen of Boulder Gay Liberation stated that most recently those opposing the referendum have taken two new approaches to defeat the measure.

They are attempting a recall of those male City Council members who supported the amendment (the female City Council members who supported the amendment have been serving in their positions for less than six months, so they are ineligible for such a recall.) The opponents are attempting to have the referendum postponed to a later date—possibly during the summer months when those members of the university would not be present. Ms. Borgen also noted that the gay community, while having a basis of strong support from many community groups, is at a disadvantage because the Boulder Daily Camera has refused to print the advertisements that Gay Liberation has prepared for them.

NOW Features Lesbianism Panel

Approximately 250 people attended the March 25 meeting of the Denver Chapter of NOW (National Organization of Women) which featured a panel discussion on “Lesbianism and Lesbian Lifestyles.”

Prior to the panel discussion, a member of the Boulder group Concerned Citizens for Civil Rights spoke on the current situation of the homosexual rights bill now pending in that city. With a recall election of the mayor and city council scheduled for May 7, the Boulder daily press has placed a “blackout” on all advertising from those who support the bill. The citizens group there welcomes all support, particularly financial.

The panel opened with a statement from each of the three members concerning her own thoughts and feelings about Lesbianism as both a political position and a sexual preference. While the link between Lesbianism and Feminism was mentioned, it was never fully discussed by any of the panel members, who occasionally drifted into apologetic tones throughout the evening.

During the question and answer session which followed, a group of “Separatist Dykes” took the floor to protest discrimination against them from the Women’s Movement and NOW. They noted that NOW had not invited any separatists to participate in the panel. A reflection, they felt, of both classism and intellectualism within the Women’s Movement and NOW. Following about fifteen minutes of sparring, the discussion moved on and closed shortly afterward.

A task force has recently been formed within NOW to focus on legislation which will help to remove legal barriers surrounding the Lesbian."

Co-op Replaces Extended Family

Harriet Hunter Ford

In these days of ever increasing  
inflation, there never seems to  
be enough money to go around.  
Not too long ago, most of us  
were part of an extended family.  
We had people to help look after  
the children, to share things  
with, and to talk with. All of  
these things were exchanged  
with one another. As people  
have become more mobile,  
many of us are many miles  
away from “family.” About  
two years ago, my neighbor and  
friend, Virginia Lehman, told  
me she had an alternative to the  
extended family. She suggested  
that we form a “co-op” in which  
we could exchange babysitting  
and other jobs we wanted done  
or wanted to do. At first, I was  
very apprehensive. I thought we  
should do things for each other  
“just to be nice.” Virginia  
pointed out to me that that was  
a very fine but unrealistic  
attitude because it is just too  
easy for one person to take  
advantage of the other if some  
kind of record isn’t kept. After  
much discussion, our co-op was  
launched. We decided that we  
would translate our “charges”  
for services or jobs into co-op  
credits. We place a co-op credit  
value on each service desired or  
offered. This is loosely based on  
what would be paid on the open  
market. One exception to this is  
babysitting. We charge one  
co-op credit per hour per child.  
A co-op credit is worth 60 cents.  
We feel that child care is  
extremely important and is too

often taken for granted. The  
children receive more than mere  
custodial care when they are  
with members of the co-op. The  
values we placed on services are  
used only as a guideline and the  
people involved are free to  
negotiate at any time. We  
exchange many services other  
than babysitting. Among them  
are: transportation,  
housecleaning, ironing,  
secretarial services, pre-school,  
food, clothes, acrobatic lessons,  
etc. The co-op now has twelve  
members which is the maximum  
number we have set for  
membership. When we first got  
started, our husbands by and  
large thought we were slightly  
unbalanced, to say the least.  
When they heard us say things  
like “I’ll give you this ham bone  
with lots of ham on it for two  
co-op credits,” there were  
certainly the diagnosis was  
accurate. Now, however, we find  
that their tune is changing. Our  
husbands are beginning to catch  
the disease. A few months ago,  
my husband became our twelfth  
member. He's a family  
practitioner and exchanges his  

Gay Coalition Needs Help

discrimination on the basis of  
sexual preference, marital status  
and age in the areas of job  
discrimination, housing, state  
certification, admission  
programs to educational  
institutions, child custody, and  
prisoner rights.

“Women in the People’s  
Republic of China have achieved  
social, economic, and political  
equality with men,” said Ms.  
Susan Klonsky, who recently  
headed the American Women’s  
Friendship Delegation to that  
country.

At a free public meeting on  
March 14, at the University of  
Colorado (Denver Center) Ms.  
Klonsky presented  
approximately 100 slides  
concerning the changes which  
have taken place for Chinese  

women since the socialist  
revolution in 1949.  
Just one generation ago  

women there were practically  
slaves in their families, had no  
legal rights, were sold into  
prostitution, and had their feet  
bound not for beautification, but  
to keep them from running  
away from their masters.

The purpose of Ms. Klonsky’s  
delegation, which consisted of  
about 14 women ranging in  
political persuasions from the  
National Organization of  
Women to the October League,  
was to “investigate changes in  
the lives of people—especially  
women—since the socialist  
revolution.”

Hold Leading Positions

“Women in China,” stated Ms.  
Klonsky, “have progressed from  
having practically no power  
whatever to holding leading  
positions in government,  
industry, education, and cultural  

institutions.”  
Chinese women are not only  

employed in almost every  
conceivable job position  
(doctors, welders, farmers,  

industrial mechanics, etc.), they  
also have control along with  
male workers to organize and  
oversee their jobs. One factory  
employing mostly women even  
shut down production for a year  
while the women there designed  
a way to protect themselves  
from lung (a disease  
common to U.S. mill workers).

“Institutions in China today,”  
explained Ms. Klonsky, “are  
geared to serve the people rather  
than to make profits.”  
(Complete health coverage, for  

example, may be purchased for  

as little as a dollar a year.)

Today there are only about  
four kinds of jobs which Chinese  
women are not permitted to do  
and these include coal mining,  
operating heavy equipment, and  
being exposed to temperature  
extremes. “The reason for these  
restrictions,” explained Ms.  
Klonsky, “is that there is a great  
emphasis on family life and it is  
feared that such jobs might  
possibly damage women’s  
reproductive organs.”  
Not Pressured To Marry  
The pressure to marry, however,  
has been taken off Chinese  
women today by making full  
employment available. Abortion  
is free on demand and child care  
centers are provided all over the  

country. Divorce is also free and  
there is no alimony to pay, but  
couples wishing to end their  
marriage usually go before a  
kind of criticism committee first  
(composed of townspeople) to  
help decide if the marriage can  
be saved.  
Women Martyrs  

Women in China are not only  
actively engaged in running the  
country today, they also played  
a large part in overthrowing the  
old system which enslaved them.  
They fought alone and with men  
in the Red Army and there are  
many pictures on display in  

Conference Held  

consenting adults for inter-  
course to occur.

The conference was split  
into four groups in the after-  
noon: counselling, health  
care, education, and legisla-  
tion.

The education group dis-  
cussed a mass media cam-  
paign to begin around April  
19. People from Denver Un-  
iversity will be making  
posters, pamphlets and other  
materials will be printed.  
There will be a speakers  
bureau set up in which  
research will be done, a  
slide-show will be made and  
people will learn to speak in  
front of a group.

The persons in health  
care agreed to develop an ad-  
vocacy program whereby a  
woman could be “on call”—  
when a woman is raped, the  
woman on call will go to the  
hospital to give emotional  
support to the victim.

Use Sexuality  

In the legislative group,  
the top priority was changing  
the prior chastity rule. At pre-  
sent, the victim's past sexual  
experiences can be used  
against her in an open court;  
whereas, the activities of the  
accused cannot be  
presented.

In the counselling area,  

the group decided to es-  
tablish a crisis center to coor-  
dinate health care services  
including counselling, court  
procedures and police. Also  
to keep the woman informed  
of her case.

The conference is only  
the beginning. The coalition  
has hopes of sponsoring  
more of these in different  
parts of the city as part of the  
educational area. All of this,  
of course, is going to take  
knowledge, concern and a lot  
of hard work, especially on  
the part of women.

Anyone interested in  
working with the Coalition or  
in more information, please  
call Dr. Katherine Saltzman  
or Julie Stark at 321-8192.  
Also, if you have been raped  
and would like to talk to  
someone call 321-8191  
(between the hours of 9 a.m.  
and 9 p.m.).

Editor's comment: In addi-  
tion to the measures taken  
concerning rape discussed  
by this conference, we think  
just as much emphasis  
should be placed on  
establishing and  
encouraging self-defense  
courses for women. An  
ounce of real prevention...

China honoring women martyrs.  
Today there is much emphasis  
on equal physical training for  
both girls and boys and both  
women and men receive training  
in the People’s Militia.

Added Ms. Klonsky, “the U.S.  
military maintains 14,000  
women to repair its uniforms,  
but in China the men must do  
this task themselves.""

Lesbians in China  
After the slide presentation  
Ms. Klonsky answered questions  
from the audience concerning  
her talk. One woman asked  
about the condition of lesbians  

STEREOTYPES  

in China. Ms. Klonsky explained  
that although lesbians were not  
persecuted outright or sent to  
institutions to become  
heterosexually-oriented, their  
sexual preference was looked  
upon as a “political deviation  
because of the emphasis on  
family structures.”

A man expressed his opinion  
that “there shouldn't be any  
question of male chauvinism in  
China because women had  
always been taught to respect  
and obey the men.”

To this utter tripe Ms.  
Klonsky said, “Well, I can think  
of about 400 million Chinese  
women who would very much  
disagree with you!”

Stereotyping Conf.  
Big Disappointment  

Randi Lornelli  

One of the problems of  
any mass movement are the  
inevitable differences in  
stages of consciousness.  
While some women are well  
along the way of developing  
totally new lifestyles, others  
are just beginning to wonder  
if maybe hubby shouldn't  
pick up his own clothes in-  
stead of leaving them where  
they fell.

Unfortunately, the Con-  
ference on Stereotyping in  
Education, held at Colorado  
Women’s College on March  
1, seemed to be aimed at  

those people who are getting  
the first faint glimmers that,  
(sexual, ethnic, religious)  
stereotyping does exist.  
Perhaps they found the con-  
ference enlightening but  
anyone who already had  
some awareness was bound  
to be bored. Who really needs  
to be told that girls are taught  
to please men rather than  
themselves?

The conference ran into  
problems from the begin-  
ning. Pre-registered par-  
ticipants had to wait as long  
as forty-five minutes to pick

Utopia in China?

So let's forget about the Women’s Movement here and
move to China. Women there, it is claimed, have achieved
social, political, and economic equality along with the men and
can supposedly even grow up to take a place on the Central
Committee someday.

While we do not intend to minimize the tremendous
strides that have been made in the interests of Chinese people
today, we would seriously question the premise that the sexes
are now really “equal” there. Certainly the Chinese govern-
ment has giant-stepped the U.S. in its efforts to combat sexism

and racism and to build a decent place to live and work for all
the people, but to assume that women have achieved the ul-
timate in what women can achieve would be a drastic mistake.

Underlying Levels

Despite the visible gains for Chinese women today, no-
thing is ever mentioned about how or if the underlying levels of
male oppression are ever dealt with or even, in fact, con-
sidered. It is these underlying levels which perpetuate a male
state where male culture and male absurdity still abound — the
kind of state that still forces women to have to ask for so-called
“equality.”

Said Ms. Klonsky in her talk Thursday night (see article,
page 3) “Go out and do it. Prove you can do it. Women have
gained respect by doing it in China.” Gained whose respect?
Proved what to whom? Why men of course. And there we are —
back at getting male approval for our existence again. And real-
ly, what is so revolutionary about that?

Granted, Chinese women are taking an active part in many
facets of the country’s operation, but “taking part” is only that.
When it comes right down to it Chinese men are still occupying
the real positions of power in China and are still making the
decisions about women’s destiny there — women occupy only
about 12% of government positions. (We'd be interested in see-

ing just how long women’s equality would last if they demand-
ed an equal share in running the government from the top
echelons.)

Who else but males would decide that women can’t be
employed in certain positions because it would “damage their
reproductive organs”? (a doubtful as well as blatantly sexist
conclusion anyway). What of the woman who doesn’t want to
have children or the Chinese lesbian, or the woman who just
might want to do one of those jobs?

Political Deviation?

Who else but men would say that homosexuality is really a
“political deviation” (just a more sophisticated way of saying
sick) not understanding that “homosexuality is a category of
behavior possible only in a sexist society characterized by rigid
sex roles and dominated by male supremacy”? (Woman Iden-
tified Woman). In spite of all Ms. Klonsky’s attempts to explain
away gay suppression in China by talking about how important
the nuclear family structure is there, the fact remains that

where gay people do not have real expression, the country is
still a sexist one underneath all its pretty layers of
achievements.
Yes women have come far in the People's Republic of China
but they also still have a long way to go.

Dear Editors:

(Re: Experience with
Separatist Dykes at March 25
NOW Meeting.)

The things I went to the
mountains to do, I’ve done.
Now I want to be with other
feminists and Lesbians, so
I've been spending a lot of
time in Denver lately.

As I listened to the state-
ments of the separatists
Monday night, I began to
wonder if I was exchanging a
positive energy environment
for a negative one. Although
I thought many of the points

I am a woman who identifies
herself as a Lesbian. For the
past year and a half I have
been living in the mountains
in semi-seclusion,
sometimes not seeing people
for days at a time and work-
ing on my own head. A lot of

Letter Continued

made by the separatists were
valid, I could not ignore the
negativism, the hatred, the
double-think and the double-
talk.

As I listened to the rap
about clothes and hair —
appearance in general — I
felt they weren't interested in
my development as an in-
dividual, my identity, or my
self-expression but only in
my indoctrination. I have long
hair and I don't feel that it’s a
cop-out; I’m not hiding my
Lesbianism from anyone. In
one way it makes things
more difficult because I have
to tell people I'm a dyke —
they can’t assume it from my
appearance. And I do tell
them — personal confronta-
tion — I prefer that to the lack
of personal contact. In one
sense cutting your hair short
is copping to the man, who
has defined woman’s
appearance. Short hair is not
traditionally feminine, and
that’s why it can be used by
Lesbians as a political state-
ment. Personally, I don’t give
a damn what anyone looks
like. I wear my hair long
because I like it and because
it happens naturally when I
leave it alone. And that kind
of thinking seems to me to be
a lot closer to freedom than
simply instating a new
stereotype is.

And work? The state-
ment was made that “we
don't work with men and we
don't work with women who
work with men” along with
statements about being the
only women where they
work. What? They don't work
with men and they are the only
women in the shops. Is there
a third sex I don't know
about? And aren’t these
Lesbians putting profits in
the pockets of the man? Now
just where are they really at?

The separatists also
spoke of classism within the
movement and about how
this divides women. I think
that’s true. But I also feel that
antagonism and hatred are

Hot Times at NOW Meeting

“THE BAD FAIRIES WHO CAME TO THE CHRISTENING
UNINVITED”

Time: Early evening, March 25th. Setting: A very polite meeting of the
National Organization for Women. Subject: Lesbianism. Par-
ticipants: Three nice Lesbians on a panel, five bad fairies, and a room
full of bewildered observers. Purpose: “To educate the public” (??!).

Panel Dialogue: We are Lesbians. We are doing our own thing. We
are living authentically. We think Lesbianism is an important issue
because NOW just formed a task force on it. We have come to
educate... 1.) I belong to the Gay Coalition and I believe in human
rights for everyone, regardless... 2.) I am a member of the Lesbian
Resource Center in Boulder and I believe I'm a Lesbian.... 3.) I am really
Cinderella... (Question: Will the real Lesbian please stand up?)

Bad Fairies: We are five women in Denver who call ourselves
Separatist Dykes. We don’t work with men and we don’t work with
women who work with men and we don’t work with anybody but
ourselves. (Question: We don’t fuck and we don’t screw and we don't
go with the girls who do?) We hate all of you straight chickies who
have long hair and wear earrings and fuck us dykes over by existing.
We get shit every day because we're dykes who are proud and strong
(not because we're loud and obnoxious) and who aren’t afraid to say
we're better than everybody else (and say it and say it and say it ad
nauseam). We never smile. We know Karate.

Audience Response: And what are you five a coalition of? ... belch...
Gee, isn't it swell that we girls can all get together like this and have
controversy in this nifty organization? ... What do you Lesbians do in
the daytime anyway? ... I'm not telling you to shut up ... shut up...
Could you tell me where the Ladies' room is please? ... Get them out of
here ... But what can we do to help you? ... Women must stop fighting
each other! Join NOW! (applause) ... Hey, I really came here to raise
money ... Pass the hat around. Throw in a dime for the dykes.

Interpretation: All kidding around aside, we realize that not everyone
has exactly the same views about Lesbianism, the political importance
of Lesbianism, or even the understanding that Lesbianism is vitally
connected with feminism. A group of women known as the
Radicalesbians wrote a statement in 1970 called Woman-identified
Woman which has been one of the most important articles ever
written on these relationships. Since they said it better than we can,
we'd like to reprint some excerpts from this statement here:

A Lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explo-
sion. .

Those of us who work that (coming to understand what this sexist
society has done to her and why it is functional and necessary for it to
do so) through find ourselves on the other side of a tortuous journey
through a night that may have been decades long. The inner peace,
the real love of self and of all women, is something to be shared with
all women — because we are all women... .

It should first be understood that Lesbianism, like male homosexuality,
is a category of behavior possible only in a sexist society
characterized by rigid sex roles and dominated by male supremacy.
In a society in which men do not oppress women, and sexual expres-
sion is allowed to follow feelings, the categories of homosexuality
and heterosexuality would disappear.
But Lesbianism is also different from male homosexuality, and serves
a different function in the society. “Dyke” is a different kind of put-

BigMammaRag,2,7,,6,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol2No7_page006.txt,"Big Mama Rag Born Out  
of Frustration, Success  

Elissa Meyer  

Big Mama Rag was born out  
of the need for expression,  
women’s expression. She began  
as an idea conceived at a  
women’s festival in Denver and  
was published for the first time  
nine months later, in October of  
1972.  

The women who worked on  
the paper and grew with Big  
Mama have learned the depth of  
meaning involved in expression  
and communication. The paper  
has become much more to some  
of us than a form of mass media.  
We have learned to share the  
frustrations and successes of  
creation, to start with nothing  
and replace the emptiness with a  
reality.  

In the beginning the  
excitement of actually seeing  
those finished and folded pieces  
of newsprint, the paper that told  
our stories and reflected our  
emotions, was sufficient to  

enhance the dedication of our  
group. Most of us had full-time  
jobs in institutions or with  
children. We met and worked on  
the paper in the evenings and on  
weekends, and although we  
encountered many difficulties in  
trying to create a newspaper  
given our time limitations, we  
managed to publish pretty  
consistently every two months  
for over a year.  

Recent Grant  

Being proud and encouraged  
by our accomplishment, we  
pursued alternative modes for  
continuing and supporting the  
publication of Big Mama. In  
January of 1974 the Aton  
foundation granted us a small  
sum of money to back the paper  
for six months. This money  
provides for one full-time salary  
of $350 per month, which we  
now split three ways among the  
co-editors, and for office  
expenses and some promotional  
money.  

Receiving this grant really  
marks a transitional period for  
Big Mama Rag. She has evolved  
from a feeling to a full-fledged  
periodical. And now the women  
who make up the staff are  
tackling the task of making Big  
Mama a successful business. Not  
in the sense of making a profit,  
but we do want the paper to  
become a self-supporting  

venture.

A great part of reaching this  
goal depends on how much the  
women’s community of Denver  
shares our enthusiasm for this  
means of expression and  
relationship with each other.  
The paper’s longevity depends  
largely on continued financial  
and volunteer support, in the  
form of subscriptions,  
contributions and work.  

We have continually kept ears,  
eyes and hearts open for ways to  
raise the necessary money. We're  
looking forward to having a  
booth at the People’s Fair on  
May 11, and we would ask any  
woman who would like to  
exhibit arts and crafts and share  
the proceeds with us to call  
Becky at 623-3423 and join us.  
We also welcome any other  
fund-raising suggestions as well  
as the energy to carry them  
through.  

Thanks for Existing  

As the paper has developed  
throughout the last two years,  
the lives of those of us on the  
staff have changed, matured and  
mingled with each other’s. And  

when we stress the continuation  

of Big Mama we emphasize this  
process. Each time we receive a  
letter that says, “Thank you for  

existing. I live in Aurora (or  
Lakewood, or Golden, or  
Kansas), and when I see Big  

Mama Rag I realize that  
Feminism is active and growing  
and even reaching out here. I am  
delighted and encouraged.”  

Every time BMA elicits that  
kind of response, the staff's  
sense of responsibility deepens.  
We grow in our commitment to  
one another and to the larger  
women’s movement. The  
recognition that women need to  
relate, to express, to exchange  
our stories and experiences has  
added significance to Big Mama  
as a paper and to our lives as her  
creators.  

Because of this commitment,  
the paper’s reputation is growing  
nationally. Presently, Big Mama  
Rag is ranked among the most  
successful women’s papers in the  
country, along with Ain’t I a  
Woman, Off Our Backs,  
Women’s Press (to name some).  
We are grateful to our readership  
and to the many women who  
have helped with the paper’s  
production.  

With this same kind of  
support, we will stay around and  
will continue to touch the  
spaces where women are  
growing stronger, where we are  
beginning to realize our  
potential as individuals, where  
women are emerging in affection  
and unity as Feminists. Because  
wherever this is happening our  
potential for social change is  
limitless.

Working Girl Mystique  

Lynda Hartman  

Have you ever heard of the  
“working boy mystique”? Well,  
neither have I. In the business  
world, there is a very definite  
“working girl mystique” where  
women are treated as girls.  

The mystique can be  
recognized by several  
characteristics. Men in offices  

are always looking for “girls”  
who will nurture them. It is not  
uncommon to be asked where  
supplies are; “get me a pencil!  
I’m helpless,” they say, “serve  
me.”  

Many men are also always  
looking for “girl’s” asses to pinch  
or trying to look at their legs  
and breasts. The shortest  
dresses, lowest cut tops (of  
course not too low) are  

excellent forms of dress. The  
men sometimes start competing  
amongst each other for the  
cutest “girl.” To call a female a  
woman often brings sexuality  
into full force. Men do  
not/cannot want to face up to  
the fact that the women in the  
office have their own sexual  
feelings, which go beyond being  
treated as “girls.”  

I have had sexual feelings  
towards the people I see eight  
hours a day. The difference for  
me is that I do not feel a need to  
compete with the other women  
for the men. I do not need to  
say how I have brushed up  
against a man’s penis or looked  
at another woman’s breasts. I  
have had fantasies about some  
of the men in my office, but I  
see them as only fantasies and  
nothing more. I can enjoy  
flirting with these men when  
both of us know all along that  
we are just playing a game, and  
we have no further intentions. I  
can also appreciate compliments  
on my appearance when it is  

done as an appreciation of my  
sexuality, and not as a pretty  
“girl” fulfilling someone  
else’s needs.  

Often the mystique role also  
comes out when one sees  
women carrying coffee to their  
male workers. How often do you  
see a man carrying two cups of  
coffee? “Girls” carry coffee as  
part of their job. They are  
considered indispensable. It is  
easy to find another coffee  
carrier! Also of course the  
female does all the kitchen work  
at home, so she can do it in the  
office. Many women today are  
calling kitchen work a job that  
should be shared by everyone  
who eats.  

It seems to me that if office  
people of both sexes cannot even  
share very simple tasks, that we  
have a long way to go before  
people will be on a more equal  

basis in offices. All office  
workers are basically  
interdependent upon one  

another. The tasks of all cannot  
be done without the other  
people in the office. We are all  
people who have to work to  
survive. Unfortunately, until  
women are treated as women,  
equality will not be seen in the  
business world.  

The “girl mystique” in the  
office must be changed.  
Nurturing, sex objects, poor  
pay, lack of privacy and  
respectability of work all lead to  
the “girl mystique.” Let's not  
forget or let people put us in  
another place; we're women!  

Work Not Important?  

The “girl mystique” comes  
into play in terms of physical  
set-up of office space. Women  
are not given offices, they don’t  

need privacy. “Girls’” work is  
not considered important  
enough for them to have the  
respect of their own office. I am  
now sitting in an area that was a  
secretary area in the entrance  
way to several offices. I am  
asked questions about the  
whereabouts of the men in the  
area even though they are in  
different departments and I  
rarely work with them.  

Salaries are another “girl  
mystique.” “Girls” do not need  
to earn much money. They may  
be supporting children and are  
sole heads of a household, but  

they’re “girls.” Also the single  
woman feels the salary  
discrimination. The trend in  

business seems to be that single  
women do not need to earn  
money! For more on women  
and job positions see BMR (No. 6 April, 1974).  

The “girl mystique” includes  
the fact that “girls” cannot  
make decisions on their own.  
They present the problems,  
bring up the solutions, and the  
male bosses make the decisions.  
This of course frees the “girls”  
from having the responsibility of  
making a wrong (bad) decision!  
Heaven forbid! Of course it also  
frees them from making a right  
decision. Part of the mystique is  
saying that “girls” cannot make  
decisions, so why worry their  
little heads!  

Personal defense classes are  
being held every Thursday night  
at 7:30 p.m. downstairs in the  
Unitarian Church at 14th and  
Lafayette. Classes will continue  
through June. The instructors  
both hold high degrees in  
Taekwon-Do but will teach a  
variety of martial arts with  
emphasis on personal defense.  
They teach other self-defense  
classes in Denver. There will be a  
minimal but not mandatory fee  
for the purchase of mats and  
pine boards. The boards will be  
used at a party at the end of the  
course. All people welcome. The  
exercise that the class stresses  
really gets or keeps the body in  
shape in addition to increasing  
physical self-confidence."

Brass Plum: Birth, Life of a Co-op

Carol Lease

wondered  
what happened to all the energy  
that dissatisfaction generated in  
the early seventies when the  
rhetoric was fading and people  
were “getting into themselves”?

Have you ever

Did anger creating its own  
frustration seek comfort in  
drugs whose banal highs eventually  
descended to religious ex-  
perience?

Many people recognized  
opportunity in the marketing  
potential of the dissatisfaction  
of “young” consumers, rounded  
up capital and invested in  
counter-culture profits. Some  
people wanted an alternative  
structure to live and work in  
that would not alienate their  
convictions from their necessity  
to survive in a city. And a few of  
these people looked around  
until they saw a store on 17th  
Street across from a small island  
park for rent and took their  
energy and made a co-operative  
for artists and craftspeople to  
make and display and sell their  
work.

The Brass Plum opened in  
December of 1970 when about  
thirty people decided that they  
wanted to work and sell their art  
and crafts through a co-opera-  
tive business structure. Annie  
Wood, an original member of  
the co-op, recalls, “a lot of  
different people were into social  
change at that time... high  
school kids from some kind of  
street academy helped build in  
the store, their teacher really  
liked the idea of a co-op and let  
them stay in the store instead of  
a classroom.

Co-op Did Well

“We opened before Christmas  
and did really well. There were  
workshops taught by co-op  
craftspeople in the part of the  
store that is now the Denver  
Free University’s coffeehouse.  
Then came the after Christmas  
sales slump and some people left  
when their work didn’t sell.

Meanwhile we learned that too  

many open doors and too many  
people wandering in and out led  
to thievery which, along with  
our lack of business experience,  
put us into debt. Our organiza-  
tion was too loose.

The Brass Plum then began to  
change from a counter-culture  
fling to a stable co-operative  
venture. Members learned that  
there is seldom instant return on  
their work, that being in a co-op  
means accepting responsibility  
not only for yourself but for the  
entire structure also through  
cooperation with each other.  
“The co-op lets each of us forget  
100% of the hassles of owning a  
store individually because we're  
all in this together and we  
support each other,” according  
to Annie.

Having the opportunity  
to meet people who buy your work  
is another advantage of the  
co-op. The artist doesn’t have to  
deal with high consignment  
rip-offs that push up prices and  
discourage sales. In a co-  
operative business the money  
exchanged for work is much  
closer to the true value of that  
work than in a profit-seeking  
business due to the absence of  
the middleperson and their in-  
come.

Co-ops Respected

People respect co-ops. A man  
stole a candle from the Brass  
Plum but brought it back with a  
quarter and an apology when he  
found out that he had ripped off  
a co-operative business.

The expenses of the co-op  
such as rent and utilities are paid  
by monthly dues and new  
membership fees. If any money  
is left over it is used for  

advertising, something that  
Bette Warren, a dressmaker in  
the Brass Plum Co-op, thinks is  
sorely needed. “No one knows  
we're here. In the past we  
haven’t done as much adver-  
tising as we would have liked to.  
We hope that the Street Fair this  
spring when the Folklore Center  
moves up to 17th and Park,  
right across from our store, will  
help us become more visible to  
the community.”

The co-op holds bi-monthly  
meetings at which business deci-  
sions are discussed and decided  
through consensus or vote.  
Every three months a new  
chairperson of meetings, secre-  
tary, treasurer, custodian, and  
advertiser are chosen. This way  
each member experiences every  
aspect of the co-operative busi-  
ness structure. Nobody wants to  
be the leader and nobody can  
become a controller. There is no  
need for a boss because cooper-  
ation tends to level the heights  
that people tend to rely on for  
survival.

Members help each other out,  
according to Jim Bednar, a  
potter from Castle Clay Co-op.  
“When I started to sell things I  
wasn't very confident. People at  
the shop were friendly and  
encouraging and now I make a  
significant part of my income  
through my craft.”

Open for Change

Even though the co-op is  
always open for changes and  
suggestions, it has basic written  
rules that are adhered to because  
it's “too messy without rules,”  
insists Annie. Being the store-  
keeper twice monthly is such a  
rule. Working two days a month  
in the shop is not as inflexible as  
it may seem. Members can work  
half days and Saturdays if they  
have other jobs and can even  
make arrangements with friends  
to work in the store for them.  
Co-op members can trade off  
days for long periods of time so  
that a member can go on long  
trips. Deals can be made as long  
as the work rule is obeyed.

As for the future, Annie says  
that the co-op “takes it as it  
comes. The reason we’re here is  
that this is the logical way to go  
about doing something you  
want to do while being in an  
atmosphere with other crafts-  
people and artists.”

There is no distinction within  
the co-op between the ten women  
members and the three men  
members. Collective action  

keeps the store going, not sexist  

stereotyping.

When asked if she experi-  
enced problems at the Brass  
Plum because of her sex, Annie  
replies, “In the co-op, no. In  
life, yes.”

Different Position

The position of a woman in  
any profit-motivated business is  
radically different from her  
position in a co-operative busi-  
ness. In the former she must  

have credentials—material and  
emotional, social and psycho-  
logical—that are indispensable  
parts of getting a job. Her life  
becomes fragmented and is split  
into the behavioral expectations  
of the boss and the customer  
and the secretary and the  
accountant. Individuality is ana-  
thema in this type of economic  
structure. Going home from  
work temporarily dulls the alien-  
ation but only change creates  
permanent relief that especially  
affects a woman who is in the  
double locked jail of capitalist  
sexism.

In the latter, each member has  
specific responsibilities in the  
co-operative store. Duties are  
cycled so that the absence of  
any co-op member cannot  
inhibit the operation of the  
entire co-op. The possible lack  
of experience that a woman (or  
anyone) may bring to the co-op  
is unimportant. Everyone learns  
and changes and hopefully  
grows, thus creating growth in  
the structure and function of  
the co-operative. A woman who  
works in a co-op isn’t seen as  
being any different from any  
other woman because she isn’t  
any different.

Theory Shattered

She shatters the “unique-  
woman-pulls-herself-out-of-  

the-baby-bottle-ghetto-theory,”  
which, like its racist counter-  
part, keeps the oppressive laws  
and practices alive and denies  
women their rights but most of  
all life.

Some of the work on sale at  
the Brass Plum Co-op includes  
photography, pottery, jewelry,  
plants, clothing for infants to  
adults, candles, toys. The store  
accepts merchandise on consign-  

ment from people who do not  
wish to become members of the  
co-op. Their consignment per-  
centage is the lowest in town.  
Anyone who may want to sell  
their work at the Brass Plum  
should bring a sample to a  
general meeting held on the  
second and fourth Wednesdays  
of every month at 5 in the  
evening at the store.

If you want to become a  
member of the co-op you  
needn't worry about elitism and  
hidden power structures. This  
co-op functions on an equali-  
tarian basis. This co-op denies  
shiny, slick, chic stores addi-  
tional income from high consign-  
ment image peddling. It destroys  
the parasitic relationship be-  
tween sellers and buyers and  
producers, insures the buyer  
high quality work and fine craft  
work at half the price, and  
dilutes the fragmentation and  
mystery of the artist's life."
BigMammaRag,2,7,,8,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol2No7_page008.txt,"Women Must Control  
Own Medical Destiny  

Barbara Hume  

The other day I picked up  
Milestones in Midwifery  
expecting to find this book  

filled with all sorts of wonderful  
things about those women  
throughout history who have  
given so much of what little  
medical care there was. Instead,  
once again, I was face to face  
with the reality of life as a  
woman. This 1967 book from  
England, a country where  
females still play a central role  
in midwifery, is by a man about  
men. Why does this book  
mention only two women? What  
can we do about it? And what  
implications does this hold for  
the Women's Movement in  
general? The answer to why this  
book is so male oriented is  
subtly provided by the author,  
Walter Radcliffe, himself. Both  
surgical techniques and  
education were the carefully  
guarded rights of men only  
historically. Of forceps,  
Radcliffe says: “...the young  
surgeons who wanted to be in  
the fashion by taking up  
midwifery...wanted to know all  
they could about the new  
forceps, which gave them a  
skill—and a weapon—which the  

midwives could not claim.”  
Though forceps and other  
surgical techniques certainly  

played a crucial role in barring  
women from the changing field  
of obstetrics, such a simple  
explanation alone does not  
satisfy why Radcliffe can claim  
all the milestones for men.  
Women were excluded from  
education at all levels. This  
meant that most midwives could  
not read or write, and so could  
not communicate their learning  
to the educated world of men.  
Thus Radcliffe is able to claim  
the use of ergot as a milestone  
for men though the female  
midwives had been using it for  
centuries before some man  
finally noticed and published his  
“new” discovery.  

No Credit  

Ergot is a parasitic fungus which  
grows on grain and in its refined  
forms is still one of the most  
important drugs in obstetrics. It  
hastens prolonged labors and  
helps the clamping down of the  
uterus after delivery to slow  
hemorrhage. Even Radcliffe  
admits that German midwives  
used it in prolonged labor, but  
he gives the credit not to the  
women who long saved lives  
with it, but to the man who  
wrote about it. We can help put  

women back into their properly  
central role in the care of their  
bodies by correcting these two  
still existent problems. This  
century has seen no increase in  
the number of women in  
medical school. Sometimes I  
think this is because women are  
too intelligent to submit  
themselves to the inhumane  
atmosphere of medical  
education today. However,  
reality dictates that as long as  
the doctor is the power  
possessor in the medical world  
instead of one member of a  
good team, we need female  
doctors—lots of them. We need  
female doctors to help reverse  
the servant roles now so much a  
part of the hierarchy. We need  
female doctors who know the  
feeling of uterine cramps as  
directly as male doctors who  
know the ache of a scrotal  
injury. We also need male  
nurses. What of that majority of  
women not in medicine? There  
is nothing which keeps medical  
personnel more alert than a  
well-informed patient who asks  
intelligent questions.  

Publish or Perish?  

The what to do about  
“publish or perish” is clearly  
important in the female-male  
battle as well as in the more  
strictly academic world.  
Education is fairly open to us  
now. Individuals and women’s  
groups can use this tool to  
rewrite the history books and to  
research more effective and  
humane techniques in women’s  
medicine, and medicine in  
general. Barbara Ehrenreich and  
Deirdre English have begun to  
counter the male version of  
history in their pamphlet,  
Witches, Midwives, and Nurses.  
This extremely important bit of  
historical research reveals for  
instance that at the time  
midwives were outlawed in this  
country, it was not as we have  
always been told, because these  
uneducated women were less  
competent. In fact, a study by  
Johns Hopkins professor in 1972  
indicated that most American  
doctors were less competent  
than the midwives. Not only  
were the doctors themselves  
unreliable about preventing  
sepsis and ophthalmia but they  
also tended to be too ready to  
use surgical techniques which  
endangered mother or child. If  
anyone, then, deserved a legal

up registration packets. The  
keynote speaker, Ms. Mamie  
Moore, Assoc. Director of  
Women and Minority Affairs  
of the Day Care and Child  
Development Council of  
America, began half an hour  
late and took an additional  
ten minutes to tell us about  
the gas lines in the East,  
(perhaps she thought there  
are no newspapers or  
televisions here in the West).  

Wrong Place?  

When that ended, my  
group was told we were in  
the wrong place. A  
messenger from the  
organizers came running in  
to assure us that, no, we  
were not in the wrong place,  
and if we would stay put we  
would be entertained/educated  
with a movie. Except there was no  
sound for the movie. And  
when they got sound, it was  
so scratchy we could only oc-  
casionally understand it. If I  
were just a bit more cynical  
than I already am, I would  
have deduced that those  
stereotypes are right: women  
really are incapable of run-  
ning things.  

The morning/afternoon  
discussion groups that I  
either participated in or  
heard reports about ran the  
gamut from the ludicrous to  
the boring. Again, my more  
charitable side says that  
some people, women and  
men, may not have ever  
thought about stereotyping  
and its concomitant problem  
of discrimination. I didn't  
happen to run into any of  
those people.  

The day’s highlight, and  
only bright spot, was Rep. Pat  
Schroeder's lunchtime ad-  
dress. Congresswoman  
Schroeder is a delight to  
listen to, for her boundless  
enthusiasm and energy if no-  
thing else. Congress is one of  
the more stultifyingly serious  
institutions around. To hear  
an actual participant joke and  
laugh about it, while also  
learning about the position of  
pro-women legislation, was  
gratifying.  

Point for Trying  

The conference  
deserves some points for try-  
ing. Coordinators, Jules  
Loventhal and Dr. Sara G.  
Zimet, obviously put a  
tremendous amount of work  
into planning: some twenty-  
one local, state and national  
organizations provided  
either or both financial and  
moral support. We were  
given some helpful pamph-  
lets on Denver resources in  
overcoming stereotyping and  
on the national laws on dis-  
crimination in educational  
institutions. A couple of dis-  
cussion groups on dis-  
crimination and the law held  
some promise, although I  
was unable to find anyone  
who attended them. Twice as  
many people (more than  
600) attended than had been  
expected. Yet on the whole,  
the conference was a crush-  
ing disappointment.  

The Women’s Defense Com-  
mittee was formed on January  
12, 1974, at a meeting held at  
the Gay Community Services  
Center in Los Angeles. Activities  
on the committee include mem-  
bers of the Tide Collective,  
National Organization for Wo-  
men, Westside Lesbian Femin-  
ists, The Gay Community Ser-  
vices Center, and the Gay  
Sisterhood at UCLA.  

The purpose of the WDC is to  
raise money for court cases  
dealing with Lesbian and Femin-  
ist oppression, and to build  
public support toward these  
causes.  

The committee is presently  
working on two separate cases.  
Lynda Chaffin has lost custody  
of her two daughters, ages 11  
and 13, to her parents because  
she is a Lesbian. Marie Nunes  
lost her job because she could  
not maintain her security clear-  
ance when it was discovered she  
was a Lesbian.  

Support is needed in the form  
of money, publicity, and women  
who can give their time. Anyone  
interested in donating money,  
please send checks made payable  
to Women’s Defense Committee

Rita Williams as Rinso White.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 7

Sharon Niederman expounds upon welfare motherhood.

“We wanted to hit them pow, pow, pow, pow,” explained one of
the performers, relaxing and still out of breath following the
rehearsal. And Harpies’ Bizarre, which played at the Changing Scene in
early April, did exactly that. *

Comprised of eight brief segments, the play barraged its audience
with statements about women and women’s roles.

The performance of Harpies’ Bizarre marked the debut of the Great
Grand Daughters of the American Revolution (GGDAR). The group,
made up of local feminists Marilee Long Saxe, Sharon Niederman, and
Rita Williams, wrote, directed, and performed the play.

Costumed in vibrant hot pink leotards and multi-colored
patchwork skirts, the trio sang, danced, and presented their poetry to
Denver viewers. With action that ranged from straightforward to
highly stylized, they focused first on one woman’s problems then on
another's pride.

Mother and daughters, wives and waitresses expressed themselves
through Harpies’ Bizarre. Three monologues, “Welfare” by Nieder-
man, “Waitress” by Williams, and “Mothers” by Saxe, provided
glimpses of disillusioned women who were either out of work or
bitter about their jobs.

Relying on a minimum of props and a maximum of energy, the
segment “Rinso White” became effective satire on women as
girlfriends, mothers, and housewives.

Somewhat more abstract, the “Ashgrove” and “Hist ye Gossips”
explored woman through poetry. These segments dealing with the
moods and sensitivities of women seemed somehow to wrap the
others into perspective and the play into an aesthetic, cohesive whole.

Harpies’ Bizarre, GGDAR explained in a Denver Post interview,
consists of “our own thoughts and views of the world.” But even
more, they emphasized, the play is an example that women can create
successfully together.

The group indicated that they are available for performance,
though they do require payment.

down from “faggot,” although both imply you are not playing your
socially assigned sex role... are not therefore a “real woman” or a
“real man.” The grudging admiration felt for the tomboy, and the
queasiness felt around a sissy boy point to the same thing: the
contempt in which women—or those who play a female role—are
held. And the investment in keeping women in the contemptuous
role is very great. Lesbian is the word, the label, the condition that
holds women in line. When a woman hears this word tossed her way,
she knows she is stepping out of line. Lesbian is a label invented by
the Man to throw at any woman who dares to assert the primacy of
her own needs.

Divides Humanity

“Lesbian” is one of the sexual categories by which men have divided
up humanity. While all women are dehumanized as sex objects, as
the objects of men they are given certain compensations... Should a
woman confront herself by confronting another woman, there are
fewer rationalizations, fewer buffers by which to avoid the stark
horror of her dehumanized condition. Herein we find the overriding
fear of many women toward being used as a sexual object by a
woman, which not only will bring her no male-connected compensations,
but also will reveal the void which is woman's real situation.
This dehumanization is expressed when a straight woman learns that
a sister is a Lesbian; she begins to relate to her Lesbian sister as her
potential sex object, laying a surrogate male role on the Lesbian...
For women, especially those in the movement, to perceive their Lesbian
sisters through this male grid of role definitions is to accept this
male cultural conditioning and to oppress their sisters much as they
themselves have been oppressed by men.

Women in the movement have in most cases gone to great lengths to
avoid discussion and confrontation with the issue of Lesbianism....
But it is no side issue. It is absolutely essential to the success and
fulfillment of the Women’s Liberation Movement that this issue be
dealt with. As long as the label “dyke” can be used to frighten a
woman into a less militant stand, keep her separate from her sisters,
keep her from giving primacy to anything other than men and family—
then to that extent she is controlled by the male culture. Until
women see in each other the possibility of a primal commitment
which includes sexual love, they will be denying themselves the love
and value they readily accord to men, thus affirming their second
class status. As long as male acceptability is primary—both to in-
dividual women and to the movement as a whole—the term Lesbian
will be used effectively against women.

... It also should be said that some younger, more radical women
have honestly begun to discuss Lesbianism, but so far it has been
primarily as a sexual “alternative” to men. This, however, is still giving
primacy to men, both because the idea of relating more completely
to women occurs as a negative reaction to men, and because the Les-
bian relationship is being characterized simply by sex, which is
divisive and sexist. On one level, which is both personal and political,
women may withdraw emotional and sexual energies from men, and
work out various alternatives for those energies in their own lives. On
a different political/psychological level, it must be understood that
what is crucial is that women begin disengaging from male-defined
response patterns. In the privacy of our own psyches, we must cut
those cords to the core. For irrespective of where our love and sexual
energies flow, if we are male-identified in our heads, we cannot
realize our autonomy as human beings.

Self-Hate

... The consequence of internalizing this role (of male-defined sexual
and family functions) is an enormous reservoir of self-hate. This is not
to say the self-hate is recognized or accepted as such; indeed most
women would deny it. It may be experienced as discomfort with her
role, as feeling empty, as numbness, as restlessness, as a paralyzing
anxiety at the center. Alternatively, it may be expressed in shrill
defensiveness of the glory and destiny of her role. But it does exist,
often beneath the edge of her consciousness, poisoning her ex-
istence, keeping her alienated from herself, her own needs, and
rendering her a stranger to other women. They try to escape by iden-
tifying with the oppressor, living through him, gaining status and iden-
tity from his ego, his power, his accomplishments. And by not iden-
tifying with other “empty vessels” like themselves. Women resist
relating on all levels to other women who will reflect their own oppres-
sion, their own secondary status, their own self-hate. For to confront
another woman is finally to confront one’s self—the self we have
gone to such lengths to avoid. And in that mirror we know we cannot
really respect and love that which we have been made to be.

... It is very difficult to realize and accept that being “feminine” and
being a whole person are irreconcilable. Only women can give to each
other a new sense of self. That identity we have to develop with
reference to ourselves, and not in relation to men. This consciousness
is the revolutionary force from which all else will follow, for ours
is an organic revolution.

For this we must be available and supportive to one another, give our
commitment, and our love, give the emotional support necessary to
sustain this movement. Our energies must flow toward our sisters,
not backward toward our oppressors. As long as Women’s Liberation
tries to free women without facing the basic heterosexual structure
that binds us in one-to-one relationships with our oppressors,
tremendous energies will continue to flow into trying to straighten up
each particular relationship with a man, into finding how to get better
sex, how to turn his head around—into trying to make the “new man”
out of him, in the delusion that this will allow us to be the “new
woman.” This obviously splits our energies and commitments, leaving
us unable to be committed to the construction of the new patterns
which will liberate us.

... It is the primacy of women relating to women, of women creating a
new consciousness of and with each other, which is at the heart of
Women’s Liberation, and the basis for the cultural revolution... We
see ourselves as prime, find our centers inside of ourselves. We find
receding the sense of alienation, of being cut off, of being behind a
locked window, of being unable to get out what we know is inside. We
feel a realness, feel at last we are coinciding with ourselves. With
that real self, with that consciousness, we begin a revolution to end
the imposition of all coercive identifications, and to achieve maximum
autonomy in human expression.

We would again like to re-emphasize that both Lesbians and straight
women are in different stages of consciousness at different times.
Consciousness raising must be done with this difference in mind,
remembering that there are countless ways to reach the objective of all
women’s culture and all women’s efforts should be encouraged in this
direction.

divisive. I'll take issue with
anything my sisters say that I
feel is a misconception, but I
don’t hate women for these
misconceptions—only the
misconceptions themselves.
Denouncing someone per-
sonally because of their
thinking is, I feel, very much a
male trait. We must re-define
and re-think the world within
our own minds, our own lives
and our own experience—
and in our own terms. And if
we can’t do it positively and
with love why are we doing it
at all?

While these women
speak of separatism, I
challenge their separatism
and their feminism. I live in a
house that I have built
myself, heated with wood
from trees I have felled
myself, loaded, hauled, saw-

ed and split myself. I service
my own car and work for a
company that is owned and
operated by a woman and
staffed almost exclusively by
women. And I don’t like being
told that I'm not as good a
dyke as they are because I
don’t hate and don’t cut my
hair.

In short then, it’s alright
to not listen to what you say,
but to miss what you're doing
leads to trouble. Separatists,
where are you really at?
Where are we all? And how
do we bring it to where we
want it to be? Not without
love.

In sisterhood,

Dear Sisters,

Nothing aggravates me or
frustrates me more than being
ripped off on repairs or work
done on my car because of my
sex. Well, it’s happened again
and this time it's particularly
depressing since it was to the
tune of $103. I’ve truly had it
and shed enough tears this time
to do something about it. But
first of all let me share some
things with you and warn you.

I've related my recent
experience to several male
friends who have told me of gas
station attendants who used to
brag about how when a woman
came in, they would disconnect
some wire or other and charge
her $10 just to stick it back in.
As for checking the oil, many of
the ladies who asked an
attendant to check it were told
the car was down a quart when
it was actually on full—then an
empty can would be brought
out, pretending to put it in and
collect the money. My
roommate and I were rapping
the other night and she told me
of a gas station she had been
going to for well over a year and
knew the people in a friendly
fashion. She brought her car in
for engine work and was too
ripped off by these “friendly”
dudes who replaced a part not
needed to be replaced.

I could go on forever. My
friends, please, please take the
time to at least learn the
minimum about your cars. It’s
time we stopped being ripped
off by these dishonest,
conniving fellows who as far as
I'm concerned are the lowest.
Take no one’s word for anything
and have things checked by two
or three different people before
making any major repairs
(mistakes).

I'd really like to hear from
you about any suggestions for
me (us) in taking care of my car
myself or what to watch for in
being ripped off as you may
have also been.

God bless all in our struggle
for equality and peace and
liberation. Peace,

Patty Kemmeter

Women and  
the Arts  

The apathy of the Denver  
public, galleries, and museums is  
stifling potential creativity; and  
offering, virtually, a dead-end  
road to women.  

In cities responsive to art,  
women have been able to  
successfully fight the  
mainstream and have built a  
creative and competitive force.  

Womanspace, a Los Angeles  
art center for women, was  
originated by L.A. women in  
January, 1972. According to the  
Women’s Survival Catalogue,  
this is the first comprehensive  
west coast exhibition space for  
women.  

Womanspace has members  
from all over the states, and  

offers unprecedented services  
and nurturance to Feminist  
artists. For twelve dollars a year,  
Womanspace members are  
offered: a slide registry,  
exhibition and voting  

privileges; and a subscription to  
Womanspace Journal.  

Other benefits available to  
L.A. women include lectures,  
workshops, and exhibitions in  
all of the fine arts. Sometime in  
the future Womanspace may  
also put on traveling exhibitions.  

Another organization outside  
of Denver which is beneficial is  
the Slide Registry. A woman  
may send up to four slides of  
her work to the registry along  
with information regarding her  
work and herself. This  
information then becomes  
available to participating artists,  
galleries, and curators. The  
W.E.B. (West-East Bag) area  
representative maintains the  
registry. Our area rep is the art  
department at the University of  
Colorado.  

Women’s art centers,  
collective and non-collective in  
membership, have sprung up in  

many cities, including: the  
Chicago Women's Graphic  
Collective, Powerhouse in  

Montreal, Women’s Art Center  
in St. Louis, AJI.R. in New  
York, and centers in  
Connecticut, Ohio,  
Pennsylvania, California, and  
Massachusetts.  

The  

non-collective  
charge a twenty to thirty per  
cent commission on works sold.  
(The average is 40 per cent.)  
Along with the art centers a  
good number of film, video, and  

theatre collectives have  
blossomed. All of these help  
bring women’s art into the  
community where it belongs.  

Denver is far behind these  
towns but some constructive  
effort is being made.  

The Thread Co., a group of  
five Denver women who pooled  
their resources and minds,  
consists of Nancy Campbell,  
Susan Cole, Nancy Deveraux,  
Pauline Olsen, and Karen White.  
These women have taken all  
kinds of fibers and turned away  
from conventional crafts to fiber  
sculpture.  

A Denver collective is now  
also being organized. They meet  
weekly at 1895 Lafayette St.  
Call Kim at 355-8950 or Ghigui  
at 756-4377 for detailed  
information.  

Although it is hard for any  
kind of serious fine art to  
blossom in Denver, it is good to  
know that a few women are  
accepting the challenge and are  
getting down to work instead of  
complaining.

“I'll Be a  

Banker”  

In working-class Irish  
Catholic Boston, even today a  
Feminist is a woman who  
asks her husband to dry the  

dishes sometimes. Few of  
the daughters in that white  
ghetto where I grew up es-  
caped; when I am in Boston  
visiting friends and relatives I  
find my childhood friends all  
living just blocks from their  
parents and sending their  
children to the same  
parochial schools they went  
to.  

To most of them, I am a  
Radical Feminist. They are a  
long way, both geograph-  
ically and emotionally, from  
my woman friends here in  
Denver who are exploring the  
possibilities of self-recognition. The one question I have  
been asked by both groups of  
women is why I have chosen  
to try to break into finance.  
The answer doesn’t come  
easily.  

Painful Choice  

In a few months I will  
graduate from the University  
with a degree in finance and  
have put out the first feelers  
toward a position as an of-  
ficer in a local bank. It was a  
painful decision at best to  
make that choice and I can  
only trace its making back a  
year to another night in April  
when I listened to a strong  
and courageous Feminist talk  
about power.  

I went to interview  
Florynce Kennedy with other  
BMR staffers there and in-  
stead of an interview got an  

amazing dose of realism. I  
had spent my few years as a  
Feminist listening to people  
talk about collective vs.  
hierarchies and group  
strength vs. individual  
power, but in Kennedy, I was  
confronted with a woman  
talking about personal power  
being used to open doors and  
about the foolishness of  
denying one’s strengths to  
help each other.  

For the first time I un-  
derstood why I felt cheated in  
classes where the professor  
had opted out of a leadership  
position in the classroom.  
Because, (let's face it), they  
still gave out the grades all  
the while they were denying  
they had anything to teach.  

One of the basic truths of  
life may be that the strength  
to help other people is direct-  
ly proportional to the  
strength you have to help  
yourself. It may seem like a  
very simple truth but its  
application changed my style  
of life.  

Soc-Fem.-Maoist?  

I have found it threaten-  
ing to have someone ask  
what my politics are. The  
people who ask this question  
all seem to expect simple  
definitive answers which I  
don't have. I have long wish-  
ed I had a ready answer like,  
“I, my friend, am a Socialist-  
Feminist with Maoist  
leanings.” (I heard someone  
describe herself like that  
once and couldn't decide  
whether I was impressed or  
scared).  

It's not a problem  
anymore. I am a woman who  
believes in the power and  
strength of women, who  
would like to see America as  
a female culture. I see no  
dichotomy between that and  
my wish to work toward that  
end by opening doors for  
others with my own personal  
money-achieved powers. To  
those who have asked me  
what I will do, “after the  
revolution,” I answer again,  
“I'll be a banker.”  
Revolutions, contrary to a  
widely-held daydream, do  
not turn countries into  
agrarian paradises. CPAs,  
bankers, pilots, mothers, file-  
clerks, and grocery checkers  
need apply.  

Dropping out is not the answer;  
fucking up is. Most women are  
already dropped out; they were  
never in. Dropping out gives  
control to those few who don’t  
drop out; dropping out is  
exactly what the establishment  
leaders want; it plays into the  
hands of the enemy; it  
strengthens the system instead  
of undermining it, since it is based  
entirely on the nonparticipation,  
passivity, apathy, and  
non-involvement of the mass of  
women. Dropping out, however,  
is an excellent policy for men,  
and SCUM will enthusiastically  
encourage it. — Valerie Solanas,  
Scum Manifesto."
BigMammaRag,2,7,,12,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol2No7_page012.txt,"High School Women:  
Denver Career Fair Sexist  

Becky Bohannan  

A Career Exploration Fair  

descended upon Denver March  
11-15. Its purpose was to give  
high school and junior high  
students a chance to discover  
what they want to do in life.  
The information booklet that  
was available to students stated,  
“Career education...will help  
you know yourself better. What  
are you like? What do you want  
out of life?” These worthy goals  
ended up on the floor of  
Currigan Hall along with soda  
cans, straws and papers to be  
swept into trash cans and  
eventually buried. For Explo ‘74  
as it was called, did not allow  
students to answer the question  
“what shall I do with my life?”  
But instead things went more  
along the line of, “Since I am a  
girl what shall I do?” and “Since  
I am a boy what shall I do?”  

Little Effort  

Little noticeable effort was  
made to interest teenagers in  
any career outside their  
traditional roles.  

The information booklet  
students received was blatantly  
sexist. Throughout the booklet  
were sketches of persons in  
various occupations. On the  
front and back cover were  
construction workers, a taxi cab  
driver, a doctor and many others  
all of whom were male. Not one  
woman was on the cover. Inside  
the booklet women were  
depicted in the usual role of  
nurse, secretary, model,  
stewardess, and housekeeper.  
Possibly the worst sketch  
showed a woman standing on a  
chair, raising her skirt and  
screaming at a mouse on the  
floor. The sketch above it  
showed a man exterminating a  
bug. How are we ever going to  
successfully combat sexism  
when students are supplied with  
information such as this? At the  
fair booths and displays were set  
up with representatives from  
practically every imaginable  
occupation. I talked with people  
in careers traditionally occupied  
by men. All those I talked with  
were men and any pictures at  
the displays of people in that  
particular field were of men.  
This also held true for fields  
generally occupied by women. I  
first talked with a man from a  
large engineering firm, who told  
me that only three women at  
the Denver plant held positions  
other than secretarial work.  
When asked about schooling  
involved in becoming a certain

kind of engineer he replied,  
“Well, if you want to become a  
lab technician...” Of course lab  
technician is about the only  
occupation in the field of  
engineering that employs  
women to any extent. He then  
said only two “girls had been  
by to discuss engineering with  
him and they were school  
teachers, one of whom was just  
collecting information to give to  
her class. He went on to say that  
usually when girls walk by a  
display that’s full of engineering  
equipment, they don’t know  
what it is so they're not  
interested. At the brick laying  
exhibit the man I talked with  
said no women were actually  
laying bricks but of course they  
did have secretaries. Three  
women had applied for a job  
though only one was called and  
she made no response and so  
lost it. When asked what he  
would say to a teenage girl who  
wanted to become a brick layer,  
he answered, “A lot of people  
think brick laying is just laying a  
brick but she’d have to be able  
to lift heavy brick slabs. And the  
language men use on the job  
isn’t always the best.”  

Men Entertained?  

Insurance is a more open field  
for women, according to the  
man I talked with. He said a  
number of women worked in  
each department but, only a  
couple were department heads.  
Few women were in his position  
though which was senior  
marketing representative. The  
reason he said was that married  
women don’t like to travel on  
business. I asked him if he was  
married. He said he was. He then  
went on to say that many men  
find it uncomfortable to be  
entertained by a woman on  
business. “But,” he added, “if  
you’re intelligent, we want  
you.” I asked two veterinarians  
how many women in the Denver

area are veterinarians. They  

started counting on their fingers,  
“Oh...two...three...who's that  
other girl...?” They finally came  
up with six definitely and  
maybe seven or eight. They  
admitted that it’s more difficult  
for women to get into Colorado  
State University’s veterinary  
school. But the situation has  
improved in the last few years  
with the number of women  
rising from three or four to  
twenty out of about ninety in  
the School of Veterinary  
Medicine. Many young women  
expressed interest in the law  
display. That field has opened  
up some in the last few years.  
One of the lawyers at the  
display was a woman. This was  
the only male dominated  
occupation that made any effort  
to reach young women. After  
experiencing so much sexism, I  
was extremely happy and  
surprised to learn that the  
Denver Women’s Resource  
Center had a table where  
information and counseling was  
available. Right next to it was a  
table with information on  
women's studies classes being  
held at various local colleges.  
This small oasis was a much  
needed respite from the sexist  
atmosphere at the career  
fair.  

Traditional Roles  

Few of Explo’s organizers and  
career representatives tried to  
reach students and interest them  
in occupations outside of their  
traditional roles. But even those  
that made an effort got little  
response (except law). It would  
have been possible to tolerate all  
the chauvinistic remarks and  
sexist displays if the students  
themselves had rejected it. But  
instead they did just the  
opposite. Young women  
crowded around the  
cosmetology, modeling and  
secretarial displays while the  
boys were at the engineering,  
construction and automotive

booths. The majority seemed to  
accept their traditional role with  
no noticeable rebellion. What is  
going to happen to this  
generation of teenagers? Will we  
be content with our parents’  
world and do nothing to change  
it? If this career fair was any  
indication, that’s exactly what  
we are going to do!  

Free To Be  

The career fair could have been  
a celebration of freedom. Free-  
dom to be what we want to be  
and do what we want to do  
instead of what society dictates.  
Unless teenagers are encouraged  
to break out of their roles, the  
majority of them are going to be  

content to stay where it's  
comfortable. Then just like  
many of their parents, years  

later they'll regret they didn’t  
do more with their lives. Explo  
'74 had the chance to be  
something great. Something  
never before done. Instead, it  
would have been better if it had  
never happened because now a  
few students who maybe were  
contemplating breaking out of  
their role have been reassured  
that such a drastic move is not  

necessary.

forces pounding away at the  
narrowness of U.S. medicine  
today.  

Working for these groups,  

researching and developing an  
even larger body of knowledge  
with which to change what is  
poor but keeping the best parts  
of medical knowledge, will  
continue to shape the medical  
care we receive tomorrow. Both  
the organization and the  
scientific content of medicine  
are open to challenge. If a  
women’s group develops a new  
idea (like vacuum extraction of  
menses) we should not just  
accept the discovery without  
question, but should keep our  
minds open to exploring both  
the positive and negative aspects  
of the new discoveries. By  
continual self-criticism and  
education we will revolutionize  
our health care and be ready  
with a better system if our  
government is ever replaced with  
a system in which better ideas  
can flourish. In this as in other  
areas of the Women’s  
Movement, knowledge is the  
first step toward gaining power  
to control our own lives. It is  
much more difficult for a doctor  
to treat you poorly if you know  
enough to ask pointed questions  
at the crucial time, or to  
recognize an omission or error.  
It is much more difficult for the  
legislature to pass poor health  
programs or prejudicial licensing  
acts if a large body of informed  
women is questioning their  
actions. It is more difficult for  
men to retain power in any area  
if we know how and why they  
attained that power or  
position.

Millions for Salaries-Pennies for Daycare

Boulder Students Unite for Quality Daycare

Jan Throndson

“A group of men, women and children have just taken over the
Alumni Center...the university police are on their way to oust them
unless we go to show our support.""

Standing in the fountain area of the Colorado University
Memorial Center, the young Feminist student shouted through a
bullhorn to 24 demonstrators, who had gathered in the cold, drizzling
rain of Monday, April 26. The demonstrators who had come to
rally at the fountain for better daycare (and who were unaware
that there was to be a building takeover) moved abruptly toward
the northwest corner of campus to lend their solidarity.

Why the drastic action? The history of the struggle for more quality
daycare on University of Colorado’s campus tells the story.

In 1971, student, faculty and
staff women at CU requested an

improvement and expansion of

existing daycare facilities, which
had changed little since they
were first established at the
close of World War II.

Baily Report

With this pressing request,
the regents, the governing board
of the university, commissioned
a study by the experienced and
widely respected educator, Bill
Baily. A year later, “The Baily
Report” was completed and
filed.

In his study, Baily documented
a need for daycare for 350
children, and recommended a
budget of $345,000. He proposed
a unique program of decentralized
“daycare homes”—private houses where
small groups of children could be
taught and cared for. Backed by
daycare professionals and
members of Boulder’s Task
Force on Women and Children,
“The Baily Plan” also sought a
central facility where children
could benefit from a preschool
atmosphere and where trained
adults could work in the daycare
units.

The study, costing approximately $25,000, was disregarded by the regents, and Baily’s contract was never renewed.

A second proposal was made
by the CU administration—the
“Taber Proposal.” This reaffirmed the need for childcare for
350 youngsters and proposed a
budget of $200,000.

It was not until April of this
year, after members of the CU
Women’s Liberation Coalition
(WLC) and other concerned individuals marched at Regent's
Hall, that the Board of Regents
appropriated funding for childcare. A total of $89,000 to
provide daycare for just 60
children was allocated.
Members of the WLC have taken
issue that this compensatory
move will do little more than bring the same inadequate childcare a bit closer to campus.

Women and Children Hold Office
Throughout Monday afternoon and evening, the
demonstrators inside the Alumni Center persisted in holding
down the director of University
Foundations, Inc., Dwight
Roberts’ office, while outside a
constant number of nearly 40
demonstrators persisted in the rain.
Not only were
protestors from the WLC, but
also from CU's United Mexican
American Students, Vietnam
Veterans Against the War, Gay
Liberation and the student
government—the UCSU.
Numerous unaffiliated students,
faculty and staff members joined
with student organizations during the entire Monday and Tuesday 32-hour takeover.
By Tuesday noon, the adults
occupying Roberts’ office felt that the children should not remain
cooped-up any longer, and at
that time the children were escorted out by the adult
demonstrators, all the time under
the watchful eye of the university
police.

Day Care is Our Right

In a prepared statement, read
from Roberts’ window to the
demonstrators below, Ms.
Jeanne Winer, member of the
WLC and staff secretary of the
UCSU, said, “...the time for
serious action has come. No
longer will we beg on our knees
for what should be ours by right.
The university is ours. We pay
for it.”

Winer continued, “Our
children are the human
resources of the entire society. It
is the responsibility of that society
to provide collectively for their
care and education. Too long has
this social duty been forced onto
the shoulders of individual
women at the expense of our
own health, careers, education,
economic well-being and personal lives... Too long have
children been confined to individual homes and limited
resources of single families. The
bonds between mother and child
should be bonds of love, not
chains of slavery.”

Winer, claiming that the
regents’ action was “criminally
inadequate,” said that the
center proposal for $89,000 will
at best provide for one-sixth of
the present daycare need and
that operational costs had not
been adequately considered.
She also stated that in the
regents’ proposal, women will
still be expected to bear the
monetary burden of childcare
costs through increases in their
housing fees.

“Individual expenses,” Winer
said, could amount to “the tune
of $81 per child per month.”

Interestingly enough, the
daycare demonstrators selected
Dwight Roberts’ office in the
Alumni Center, because it is the
“University of Colorado Foun-
dations, Inc.—one of the several
sources from which funding
could be found for childcare.”
This office solicits funds from
donations for specific projects,
such as the law and pharmacy
buildings, and the business
library, but at no time has it ever
made daycare a priority for funding.

Insensitivity to Women

Citing this as an example of
administrative insensitivity to
women’s needs, Winer said,
“There is no reason why a university with an annual budget of
over $600,000,000, that can afford to pay its figurehead president
$50,000 a year plus benefits, can’t provide $345,000 for adequate childcare.”

It was also emphasized that
there would be no need for an increase in student fees or a
decrease in student benefits to
provide for childcare.

Various speakers on
Tuesday's bright, sunny afternoon expressed several views in
support of a better quality
daycare program.

One spokeswoman from Kiddie Kampus, the present CU
childcare facility, said she per-
sonally had been working for
change for three years. Speaking
from experience in working
with low-income families, she
said, “Try living on $300 per
month and try to spread it evenly
among two adults and a
child...you can’t live reasonably
well when 27% of your income is
going to pay for childcare.”

“Besides this,” she said, “that
27% for childcare expenses
leaves nothing for the child’s
medical insurance.” She was
speaking to the issue that
besides the need for high quality
childcare, the care should be
low-cost.

Ann Markusen, assistant
professor of economics at CU,
addressed the Tuesday afternoon crowd of nearly 100, on the
importance of daycare, as a
necessity of Women’s Liberation.

“Childcare enslaves women
to the home, especially lower in-
come women...the necessary
conditions of Women’s Liberation are economic conditions.”

President Claims “No Authority”

During the entire 32-hour
dramatization for childcare, the
participants encountered
numerous difficulties with the
university police and regents’
non-responsiveness. While the
building was being held, the inside demonstrators and CU student body co-presidents, Cyndy
Calkins and Anita Sanchez,
made countless attempts to
mediate with the regents and
police.

Detrimental to the outcome of
the demands of the group was
the fact that all the regents were
out of town (some in New
Orleans at a university banquet)
and were impossible to reach in
order to talk out the demonstrators’ demands. After
a telephone session with
recently-dismissed President
Thieme, whose term lasts until
June 1, the mediators reported
that Thieme said he had no
authority left to call the regents
back for a meeting with the
demonstrators.

Later, Tuesday night at 8:30,
Thieme rediscovered his
authority, and ordered the university police to oust the occupiers of Roberts’ office. Earlier
notified by Dean of Student Af-
fairs, James Quigley, that they
had to be out by 5:00 pm, or they
would be issued summonses,
the demonstrators left two and a
half hours later, charged with
“interference with faculty, staff
and students in an educational
institution and failure to leave
the building after being ordered
to leave.”

Day Care Demands

The list of ten demands stated
by Ms. Winer, and left unmet by
the regents were whittled to two
demands after the first few
hours of the demonstration. The
two major demands included
amnesty for the inside
demonstrators and a guaranteed
meeting to discuss the daycare
problem with the regents.

Amnesty was granted for those
who left before 5:00 Tuesday
evening; however, a daycare
meeting with the regents was
never guaranteed.
Among the list of demands,
the following were included:
— That Sept. 1, 1974 be set as
the completion date for the $89,000 housing units for Kiddie
Kampus, passed on April 25,
1974, by the regents.
— That operational costs for the
daycare center be added to the
$89,000.
— That operational costs for the
daycare center be added to the
$89,000.
— That there be no increase in
married student housing living
costs to get funds for childcare
expenses.
— That the regents call a
meeting devoted solely to the
issue of committing themselves
to the demands.
— That total and unconditional
amnesty be granted to all people
inside Dwight Roberts’ office.
The Silver and Gold Record, a
CU faculty and staff newspaper,
reported that, “The only childcare facility is Kiddie Kampus, a
perpetually underfunded
program, housed currently in
ramshackle buildings...and
staffed by persons who rarely
make more than $2 per hour.”
In fact, in the past the program
was housed in World War I-vintage quonset huts and frequently staffed by work-study
students at minimal wages.
Kiddie Kampus Inadequate
Daycare professionals have
reiterated that the high turnover rates at Kiddie Kampus and
the use of barely-trained
students could increase the
problems of young children,
already burdened with the stress
of low incomes and broken
homes.

It is a widely-known fact that
some CU parents find it
necessary to bring their children
to classes with them.

After the unsuccessful
attempt on April 29-30, daycare
demonstrators again marched
on Thursday, May 9.

An educational drive is now
underway to inform all students,
faculty and staff of the inadequate daycare facilities. A survey is being taken by the daycare
committee to find just exactly
how much the need for childcare
has increased since “The Baily
Report,” and how many people
would support the drive for more
quality daycare."

Women in Transition (WIT) is
keeping on keeping on. New
staff members (Barbara and
Karen) have taken over respon-
sibilities at WIT, together with
several other volunteers.
However, WIT desperately
needs community support to pay
for phone bills, food for women
and children without resources,
etc. WIT also needs more
volunteers. If you are interested
in working at WIT, call Mona
(433-8127). For those readers
who are not familiar with the
work of the WIT house, it is a pro-
ject that provides concrete help
to women who are attempting to
change their lives. The house
receives up to 40 phone calls a
day from Denver women seeking
help, and provides temporary
residence for anywhere from 2
to 20 women and children at a
time. Kathy Disilets, who is leav-
ing for Oregon soon, has been
staffing the house almost entirely
on her own for the past several
months. BMR salutes her for the
important work she has been do-
ing in Denver, and wishes her
much happiness in Oregon.

BMR is looking for the artist who
drew the “Creating the Un-
iverse” graphic in our May issue.
We would like to give you credit
for your work and discuss a
future project with you. Please

Life in this society being, at
best, an utter bore and no aspect
of society being at all relevant to
women, there remains to
civic-minded, responsible,

eliminate the money system,
institute couple automation and
destroy the male sex. — Valerie

Morgan: We’re the  
Women That Men  
Warned Us About  

Chocolate Waters  

“We all know the male mass media stereotype of the Women’s  
Movement: ‘If you've seen one Women’s Libber, you've seen ‘em  
all—they each have two heads, a pair of horns, and are fire-  
spouting, man-hating, neurotic, crazy, frigid, castrating-bitch,  
aggressive, broom-riding witches.’ So I want to start out by saying  
that this shocking stereotype is absolutely true,” said Robin  
Morgan to a group of about 100 people gathered in University of  

Colorado's Mackey Auditorium, April 8.  

Morgan, Feminist author,  
editor, and speaker went on to  
cover a number of topics perti-  
nent to women—including  
gynocracies, women’s revolu-  
tion, rape, pornography, and the  
Church. She began by explain-  
ing that we women are really a  
colonized people who have been  
alienated from our basic  
land—our bodies. “We have  
been used for childrearing and  
sex and have been made to feel  
unclean, but the time is here for  
us to take back our own land.  
Yes, we are the women men  
have warned us about!”  

She continued by talking  
about the Women’s Movement  
itself and observed three basic  
areas which have emerged. The  
first one being the Civil Rights  
area where groups (such as  
NOW) tend to work within the  
capitalistic and patriarchal  
system. “Although these groups  
often settle for legislative  
reform, their work is still in-  
tensely valuable,” said Morgan.  

The second area is what she  
called the Women’s Liberation  
part of the movement, where the  
refugees from the Left (or the  
“boys’ movement”) gathered  
together. Said Morgan of the  
woman who had been working  
in the Left, “wiping the tear gas  
from her eyes, she would then  
go home and make supper.” She  
added, “If people wonder why  
the Left is dead, it’s because  
most of the women (who were  
doing the shitwork) have left.”  

Radical Feminism  

The third and perhaps most  
important is the Radical  
Feminist part of the movement  
where women are not interested  
solely in reform. Affirmed  
Morgan, “I do not want to be  
equal with what it is men are in  
this society.” She went on to ex-  
plain that Radical Feminists are  
interested in working towards a  
world run by and on the power  
and love of women. In clarifica-  
tion of power (a tricky concept),  
she added, “not in the male  
sense of power over someone,  
but in the context of a ‘power  
plant producing energy.’ The  
power plant itself radiates life-  
giving energy, but does not con-  
trol life.”  

In such a society there would  
probably be few of the ills which  
characterize the patriarchal  
world of today. One of these ills  
is rape. Speaking out against  
rape, Morgan defined the crime  
as “any pressure on a woman to  
have intercourse against her  
will. According to that definition,  
the bedrooms of happily-married  
couples are often scenes of rape  
and every man could be defined  
as a rapist.”  

She also stressed the need for  
rape crisis centers run by  
women and further pointed out  
that in New York City last year  
only 4% of all rapes were  
reported and for the 18,000  
cases that did get to court there  
was only one conviction.  
Statistically, white women are  
raped most often by white men  
and Black women by Black men  
(contradicting the myths). “But  
interestingly enough,” she add-  
ed, “70% of all rapists are  
men.”  

Verbal Visual Rape  

Concerning verbal and visual  
rape—pornography, Morgan  
called it “one of those areas  
where mama was right.” Sex is  
used pornographically in a  
destructive, sadistic, conquering  
manner—just one more way of  
putting women down. She com-  
mented about “judges reading a  
lot of dirty books with one hand,”  
but went on to say that women  
are finding some of their own  
ways to deal with pornography.  
In Knoxville, Tenn., for example,  
women took pictures of men as  
they emerged from dirty book  
stores and plastered these pic-  
tures up all over town.  

As Morgan came to the end of  
her talk, she explained that a  
woman had requested a reading  
of “Monster,” the title poem from  
her first published book of  
poetry. Although she doesn't  
usually read her poems during  
speaking engagements, Robin  
closed the evening with a most  
powerful and moving reading.  
Seconds of silence followed by  
tears and thunderous applause  
affirmed that the audience in-  
deed shared the pain of Robin  
Morgan's experience as a  
woman as well as her hope of a  
new and promising world for us  
all.  

- An Interview  
With Robin Morgan  

Maureen Mrizek  

Chocolate and I traveled to  
Boulder to interview Robin  
Morgan on the afternoon of April  
8. We found her conducting a  
discussion in the upstairs of the  
SMC building. She sat patiently  
answering questions and  
illuminating Feminist concepts  
with an unending supply of facts  
and analysis.  

After the discussion we walk-  
ed down to the Women’s Center  
for the interview. I may add that  
the Women’s Center was bright-  
ly festooned with pictures of  
women supporting some of the  
most recent male national  
liberation struggles, and there  
were posters advertising the  
Women’s Center presentation of  
“Lucia” (a movie about a woman's  
role in a man’s revolution). Lucia  
seemed to be the hottest thing to  
hit town since the Betty Crocker  
Bakeoffs.  

Back to the interview—we  
didn’t really push a lot of things  
into the interview because Robin  
had been talking politics all  
afternoon and her voice seemed  
to be fading away. But we talked  
about a few important topics. We  
wanted to know her view of the  
differences that exist in the  
Women’s Movement. She said  
that she felt there could be “a  
tremendous strength in diver-  
sity”—that we have a “12,000  
year old battle to fight and there  
will, most likely, be more than  
one way to fight it.” She said she  
felt that diversity is a “natural  
outcome of our growth as a  
movement,” and that “it matters  
less where a woman is coming  
from than where she’s going to.”  
She suggested that we should  
ask ourselves “What is our com-  
mitment to a worldwide  
Women’s Revolution?” She felt  
that instead of developing in  
terms of “vanguardism” and the  
“correct line” we should con-  
centrate more on “respect for  
the individual and where she  
feels most comfortable.” She  
suggested that some of our  
divisions “are the product of  
moral laziness. They are an ex-  
cuse for not confronting men,  
the real oppressors.”  

We talked about the  
differences that women face in  
working together politically,  
which I, for lack of a better term,  
labeled the “Consciousness  
Chasm,” the differences in  
women’s Feminist con-  
sciousness. She said that  
women with a more advanced  
Feminist consciousness  
“should not lose sight of where  
they themselves have been,”  
that “all of us at some time in our  
lives have thought ‘I’m not op-  
pressed’ and believed it.” She  
suggested that we view  
ourselves as “facilitators un-  
covering the layers of defenses  
women have built up for survival  
in a man's world.” She said

Political, Spiritual  
Feminism Flourish  
In New Mexico  

Linda Fowler  

“The Women's Movement in Santa Fe is really together,” a friend  
told me. It seemed like a good idea to check it out.  

Going into my second day in Santa Fe, I could feel the birth pangs my  
sisters were suffering. They had been able to establish the Women’s  
Health Services (in spite of hassles from the state over abortion  
counseling), the Santa Fe Women’s Commune which the  
women published on their own press, and a women’s center, “The  
Gathering” (I Ching), established on little more than energy. With this  
last development, social stigmas arose because the center is located  
on the edge of the barrio and had been founded by a predominantly  
Lesbian group.  

In an effort to dissolve the stigma and establish a unified sisterhood  
in Santa Fe and statewide, these activist sisters sought to join with the  
New Mexico Women’s Political Caucus during the planning session  
for the state convention scheduled to be held in Santa Fe. As so often  
happens, the situation came down to the issue of Lesbianism; in this  
case, simply the right to use the word and call oneself what one really  
is. The meeting of the by-laws committee was packed. Those who felt  
“Lesbian” is not a dirty word won out. The by-laws were rewritten,  
and many of the women who had opposed this change—some of  
whom were in a position to be politically helpful to Feminism—walked  
out of the meeting and withdrew from the caucus. Result? Same old  
story: a lingering atmosphere of debate and division within the  
Women's Movement. And in this case, giving up on the sisterhood.  
The activist women, feeling oppressed by their own sisters, have lean-  
ed heavily on Marxism and are seeking to merge with other oppressed  
groups in Santa Fe. They have abandoned the women’s magazine, and  
will instead begin publishing a general community newspaper, hoping  
to be joined by other oppressed people as the paper develops. Theirs  
has become a class struggle. Their predicament underlines a dilemma  
common to many women's efforts in the embryonic stage: until suf-  
ficient grassroots support can be established, women are forced to  
deal with the system on its own terms through coalition and com-  
promise.  

Factionalism Blurs Vision  

Is this the road the Women’s Movement is going down? Fac-  
tionalism, with the resulting blurring of vision and scattering of  
energies? Here are women who feel they are better off compromising  
their Feminism because they cannot come together with their sisters,  
and cannot, on the other hand, cease functioning. Channeling their  
women’s energies (these women alone created the new community  
newspaper) into a coalition with other oppressed groups, they can no  
longer look to their own oppression as their fundamental cause. And  
once again women’s position becomes secondary.  

What happens in this situation to a woman who wants to be active  
but not just in another splintered political group? As a woman named  
Columbine told me, “I want to live in Santa Fe. I want to work in the  
Women’s Movement. But I want to work with other women; not with  
men. And I can’t put out a paper alone. I feel torn.” She talked of an ap-  
proach other than political—another level deeper in. And we went to  
Albuquerque, to the Labe’ Collective.  

Labe’ Collective  

The Labe Collective had been formed by a group of ten Lesbian  
women, many of whom are craftswomen, activists, and spiritualists.  
They seem devoted to living together collectively and harmoniously,  
i.e. a musician, an artist, a silversmith, a creator of leather clothing, all  
living together in one house and apparently flourishing; to individual  
development—they have an awareness of the need for each woman to  
have time alone, to be in her own space; to stress individual as well as  
group activism; and to the channeling of energies not into changing  
the existing structure but into the development of a woman's culture.  

This development requires a fundamental spiritual base, not a  
political one. Although politics can get you what you want, politics can  
not tell you what you want. In order to know what you want you must  
know who you are. Knowing this is the basis for a women’s culture.  
Being it is the culture. You are it.  

In an atmosphere that is non-competitive, that is supportive of self-  
knowledge, self-ability, and personal development, in a living collec-  
tive composed entirely of women with a minimum of outside male in-  
fluence, craftswomen, writers, artists—all conscious women—come  
to discover those things which are basically, commonly woman and to  
express those characteristics through their creations. Here are the  
beginnings of a Feminist culture.  

Why within Labe? Because Labe is generative. Generative because  
being Lesbian, separation from male influence is much easier. And  
this separation may be necessary if any women’s culture is to be  
found. Generative because spiritualism (the looking inward to know  
the self) and closeness become elemental.  

The elemental, the spiritual may prove a better base for achieving  
Feminist goals than a political one. While political focus is external in  
nature, spiritualism looks inside and tells us what women are, who  
women are, who we ourselves are. It can unite us through the  
knowledge and understanding of what is basically woman, and can  
perhaps give us the rudiments of a matriarchal religion. Lesbians may  
be the ones who can lay down a framework, rather than the hand. (See  
letter p.9 from Labe Collective.)

**Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 8**

**Dr. Wolf Analyzes Women's Roles**

**Linda Fowler**

Dr. Wolf is a nationally known sociologist, a feminist, and founder of the Denver chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). She is a professor at Colorado Women’s College (CWC) where she teaches a course on women in social situations. With the termination of the academic year, she will leave CWC to become head of the sociology department at Ohio Wesleyan University.

I interviewed Dr. Wolf in her office at CWC. We talked about the influence of various kinds of social structures on the development and behavior of women in the United States today, about the development of women within the family, and through groups of other women within the Women’s Movement.

**BMR:** Dr. Wolf, could you comment on the influences of the American family on the development of women?  
**Dr. Wolf:** A while ago I thought the nuclear family was the worst thing that could happen to women. It’s been an absolute disaster. And I thought perhaps communal living might be the answer. But then I did a study of three mountain communes, and almost without exception, women seemed to be carrying the load—doing all the work. And men are doing what I call the new role for men, the male drone role where they expect all the traditional privileges but none of the traditional responsibilities. The best of all possible worlds. So I don’t think that's the answer. What we're looking for is a real sharing of roles; a blurring of roles. And the term “unisex” doesn’t frighten me one bit.

I think we're going to go on having family units of some kind. What kind of unit would provide openness for every individual to develop? I think maybe in some ways a small family is better than a large one; mostly because of cross-cultural research which points out that when there are lots of male and female adults there is a division of labor, and it seems to go along sexual lines; there isn't a crossover.

**Raising Children Collectively**

**BMR:** What do you see as possibly developing for a family situation? Obviously, the commune isn't the answer. It’s pretty evident to me that in most communal situations there are certain surface differences that are quite different from the society at large, but when you come down to the basic interpersonal relationships they are exactly the same as they have been; so that doesn’t answer the question. What do you think about the collective as a system of child-rearing and family integration where several families might live together or in the same area? The raising of children is done collectively by the entire group.  
**Wolf:** I think so far it’s one of the best ways, and certainly for children. Children cease to be the responsibility of some poor woman basically and of the couple basically, and should and do sometimes become the responsibility of the whole collective. I think, probably, the best places I've seen for women, even though they haven't lasted very long, are those that have been in cities and people all work outside the home. They are families living together in a big house or on a farm and go into town to work—like in Boulder on the Nelson Road place. There you have a lot of problems, but I think maybe it’s more conducive to the development of women.

**BMR:** Do you think there is a significant difference between women who are functioning in marriage and women who are functioning more or less alone? Do you think there are any differences in the pressures that are felt in their ability to develop as individuals?  
**Wolf:** I think it’s probably easier to develop if you're living alone and you can choose friends without pressure. I think we should have great compassion for the housewife. Financially and emotionally there is a great amount of pressure for her to stay where she is and not change; and those who do manage to isolate themselves from this situation need support. The Women's Movement is providing this support in all kinds of unlikely places that a few years ago seemed hard to get to. We who have some awareness can't simply step away from all this—we've got to help one another—we need each other—we need the grassroots—we've got to help other women.

**Middle Class—Working Class**

**BMR:** It seems to me that it’s often very difficult to get this kind of awareness from the middle-class woman about what her own personal and social situation really is, because she has privilege to make her feel she has freedom and they are not the same thing at all. Working and lower-class women, on the other hand, rarely have the same kind of privilege. Their oppression is much more overt and they can see it more clearly.  
**Wolf:** They see economic oppression more clearly; they do not see interpersonal oppression as clearly and this has always been the case. We have to face some kinds of real things that occur in terms of communication. Communication goes from the top down—how the image of upper and middle-class women is emulated by working-class women. If you can get people to realize that, that’s an important first step.

**BMR:** Are you talking about taking steps to reach women in middle and upper-class communities as a means of influencing those women who are in lower socio-economic groups?  
**Wolf:** I think these steps have already been taken—in television, certainly a lot in magazines. A few years ago women who were in the Women’s Liberation Movement were funny; humor in a kind of scaffolding fashion (you laugh and then you destroy). It’s not happening too much now. This has made it acceptable for poor women who depend on a job and have been afraid to have Women’s Liberation attached to their name. Afraid to be other than, quote, feminine. You've got to get support from other women.

**BMR:** What things do you think begin to happen when women come together in groups within the Women's Movement? We talked about women functioning alone and also within the family. But then you go on to women functioning in groups of women. There seem to be changes that occur when this happens.  
**Wolf:** I think probably one of the great things about the Women’s Movement is that we have come to desire and like our own company, and we didn't used to. To go out with women was considered the worst kind of thing to do. You know, “Can't you do better than that?” Part of the whole horrible picture of hating ourselves, hating one another and judging everything in terms of the dominant class ideology—male. I don't think this happens so much anymore. I think women who are involved in the movement really enjoy the company of other women and really like women as individuals. This great sense of solidarity has come through the movement.

**Radicals in the Movement**

**BMR:** Do you feel that radicalism within the women’s movement has value?  
**Wolf:** It frightens some women; for some it is absolutely terrifying. If you say anything in terms of the family structure it scares them.  
**BMR:** Nothing is going to change, really, in the society until the family itself changes. This is the keystone.  
**Wolf:** This is why I felt reluctant in terms of what the future might bring even if you have a communal situation or if you have families living together; the kernel of the family is the same thing. Nothing changes. It’s like a raisin pie in which the raisins are in a certain relationship to each other: you can transport the pie all over the place but nothing changes internally.  
**BMR:** There is a surfacing now of radical Lesbians in the Women's Movement. What sort of effect do you think this is having on the movement and on societal structure generally?  
**Wolf:** I think Lesbian women are a very valuable part of the Women’s Liberation Movement. I think we have to include all women in the liberation movement. Probably when I came face to face with it, was when I, as a member of NOW, was called a Lesbian. At first I said, “Oh no. No, no.” And then you think, “Goddamit, what are you trying to beat me with?” I don’t think we should let this be a club.  
**BMR:** This is one of the most potent things to hit women with because this is something that definitely steps outside of the male-oriented culture and therefore is quite a threat to the patriarchy. Thereby it is a threat to women who are still very much identified with the patriarchy. The lifestyles that are developing within the Lesbian community are certainly radically different from the nuclear family unit that holds the whole society together. And this may be something of a key to what is needed to change the society as a whole. There is an absence of dominance-subordinance patterns and sometimes collective child-rearing in collective households. Do you think this might begin to really change things?  
**Wolf:** I think that’s fine if it does. I don't think it’s happening with great enough frequency to have any effect at all. What worries me is that there will be a kind of repressiveness. Economic situations, political situations have not been very conducive to an openness. There is a fear, as with the sexual preference bill in Boulder, and if there is enough momentum here I think it will have an effect of beating people back into closets, back into kitchens. And these hard-fought gains of all of us in terms of making life a little more decent for all kinds of people—I mean how many gains can we hold on to?

**New Directions**

**BMR:** If Lesbianism is discussed...**

**Gays Meet Vice Chief**

At a recent meeting with Captain Jerry Kennedy, Denver Vice Bureau chief, Gay Coalition representatives discussed harassment of gays by vice squad officers in gay bars. Marge Johnson, coalition member, said that on various occasions vice squad officers had told women in The Three Sisters Bar, “We just came to look at all the pretty little dykes,” and “Don’t get uptight, girls—we just came to watch.” She also told Kennedy that vice officers have tried to solicit dates from female customers in the bar. “This is unprofessional conduct,” she said, and pointed out that Lesbians believe vice squad officers go there to provoke trouble.

Kennedy replied that to his knowledge no vice squad officer had recorded in the bureau log having been at The Three Sisters. He suggested that the bar managers keep a log of vice officer visits to the bar and that women record the name, physical description, and officer’s badge number and file a complaint with Kennedy if they feel they've been harassed.

Sometimes vice officers work undercover and, therefore, are not obligated to provide identification when requested to, according to Kennedy. He pointed out, however, that customers could get license plate numbers and turn them in to him.

He said he instructs vice bureau officers to “enforce the law and keep your opinions to yourselves.”

**Rape is a Vice**

Ms. Johnson also asked Kennedy whether the vice bureau is involved in surveillance of gay groups in Denver and in investigation of rape cases. He replied “no” to both questions. Ms. Johnson said she considers rape to be a vice.

Coalition members said they wanted to hold “education sessions” with vice officers and to get a liaison officer between the vice bureau and the gay community. Kennedy agreed to these requests. Gerald Gerash of the Gay Coalition pointed out to Kennedy that being gay is not the problem, per se—homophobia (fear of homosexuality) is the problem that needs to be dealt with.

Coalition representatives also recommended to Kennedy that there be gay representation on the vice bureau. Kennedy responded, “Do you have anyone to suggest?” Coalition people said not at the moment, but that they would communicate Kennedy's interest to the gay community. Any gay person who is interested in working on the vice squad is asked to contact Cordell Boyce at the Coalition office, 831-8838."

Games We
Still Delay

Anne Zeigler

The new wave of Feminism, the sisterhood we have generated
over the past few years, and the embryo accomplishments of our
new consciousness have given women a glimpse of the heights and
breadths we can reach as women. And yet, simultaneously with
our growth as Feminists, we have developed a new repertoire of
games (some of them insidiously incorporating Feminist analyses)

as a new rationale for passivity.
I have found many ac-
complices in my own self decep-
tion, and have substantially aid-
ed other women to deceive
themselves. Some of the games
we play are new disguises for old
ploys—others are developed as
we are increasingly exposed to
new and threatening situations
and need some way to hide from
ourselves and whomever we are
trying to manipulate into loving
us. As we allow ourselves to
continue to play these games,
we remain bound to the tread-
mill of non-success which has
been trapping us for centuries.
“Dancing Dog”

I call the first game “Dancing
Dog,” after an often-quoted in-
sult of Ben Johnson: “A learned
woman is like a dancing dog: one
wonders not that it is done well,
but that it is done at all.” The
woman who plays dancing dog
tends to be astonished that she
actualizes anything at all, and to
expect others to praise her for
doing much less than she really
can. This is a good way to avoid
criticism, as a dancing dog can
hardly be criticized for not being
Rudolph Nureyev.

Dancing Dog is also a very
effective way to avoid the con-
flict of not wanting to fail, but of
being afraid of success, a dilem-
ma in which many women often
find themselves. Sisters who
reinforce a player of dancing
dog, refusing her the dignity of a
loving but honest appraisal of
her work, may do so for many
reasons. I think these reasons
are mainly rooted in the issues of
identity and competition. Rather
simply put, if we are male-
identified to some extent, a
woman who does well becomes
a competitor for approval and
attention. If we are struggling to
become woman-identified, we
have to face the scary situation
of knowing that we, too, can
succeed, and deal with all the
fears that success evokes.

Another dynamic that main-
tains the game of Dancing Dog is
our ineptness in handling feed-
back. Rather than accepting
feedback as an opportunity for
growth, we often see it as a
critical undermining of our
achievements, and even more
intensely, as an undermining of
ourselves. And rather than giv-
ing feedback in a loving, tactful,
sharing way, we tend to feel
critical out of our own sense of
competition or inadequacy, and
to avoid anything like criticism,
lest it reveal our anger or fear or
insecurity. We are not so fragile
that we should be afraid of
breaking or destroying each
other by assuring each other of
our potential for growth.

“There, there, dear, you just
cry all you want to.” All the nur-
turing and caring that we have
developed are used in this game
to smother us. Nurturing should
make us stronger in the face of
obstacles, should generate
energy, should encourage us
with the knowledge that we are
loved and unconditionally
worthy of love.

“There, there” is a game in
which support becomes
crutches, and stumbles and falls
evoke attention and sympathy
for their own sakes. We need to

learn to express our concern, but

we need to help each other to
realistically analyze and con-
front setbacks, fears, con-
ditioning, rather than to wallow
in them. We need to help each
other to develop discipline and
staying power, to gain a sense of
perspective towards obstacles.
Girls Give Up

Experiments with children un-
der two years of age have shown
that little boys, when confronted
with a barrier between
themselves and their mothers,
will try to cross the obstacle or
find a way around it, with some
persistence. But small girls, if
they try at all, give up soon and
cry to be rescued. The habit of
giving up was ingrained in us
very early, and we need to
recognize it and gain a sense of
faith in our power over our en-
vironment, rather than to admire
ourselves and others for the
number and difficulty of the
adverse circumstances we find
and create for ourselves. We all
need help and love, but we must
learn to ask for and give help and
love, rather than to ask for rein-
forcement for pain and failure.

Dilettante: this is another
favorite game, which seems to
spring from several sources. The
first is that it's okay for a woman
to be bright...but not too bright;
competent...but not too compe-
tent. So when we find ourselves
getting competent, we switch to
another area of interest where
we are less accomplished. This
way, we don’t violate any
achievement taboos, but still can
find challenge and opportunity
for growth.

A dilettante is spared the
frightening responsibility of tak-
ing herself or her work seriously,
of avoiding the risks involved in
commitment to one discipline,
and some dilettantism also
seems to be a remnant of the
way we prepared ourselves to be
ready to help our man in his
work—whatever it turned out to
be; to be sufficiently informed to
be stimulating companions, but
not so much as to be
competitive. A smattering of
everything makes us more
marketable, adaptable to more
men’s lifestyles.

Begun to Explore

Another, and more positive,
source of dilettantism is the fact
that we have begun to explore
the world around us with a new
attitude, that it is full of exciting
things in which we were
previously forbidden (by custom
and isolation, as well as by law)
to participate.

But as we establish our new
identities as actors rather than
as bystanders and helpers, we
are going to have to learn the
habits and attitudes of commit-
ment and serious participation,
rather than those of helpful
amateurs and accessories.

Us-Them: one of the most bla-
tant manifestations of our in-
security is our tenden-
cy—still—to find strength and
identity in elitism. “We older
Feminists” do not have any
monopoly on the right ideas or
any superiority as women, just
because we have been aware of
our oppression for a few years
longer, or know the rhetoric a lit-

“Great Art” proves that men are
superior to women, that men are
women, being labeled “Great
Art,” almost all of which, as the
anti-feminists are fond of
reminding us, was created by
men. We know that “Great Art”
is great because male authorities
have told us so, and we can’t
claim otherwise, as only those
with exquisite sensitivities far
superior to ours can perceive
and appreciate the greatness, the
proof of their superior
sensitivity being that they
appreciate the slop that they
appreciate. — Valerie Solanas,
Scum Manifesto.

little better than other women

We are all just beginning to
ask the right questions, let alone
struggle through to the answers
that will liberate us. There are
many people with whom we may
disagree; there are many times
when we know that sharing past
experiences could provide some
guidance to other women who
are in the midst of similar ex-
periences now. But to deny
another woman's feelings or ex-
perience, or to subject her to
ridicule because she has not
learned the same lessons in the
same way will only reinforce all
that traditional conditioning to
which she has been sub-
jected—it will not strengthen
either of us or help to unite us.
There is no us-them; there are
different perspectives and
knowledge and strengths and
experiences. To push someone
over into a “Them” position
limits her, implies that she is not
capable of growing and
changing—limits us in our small
progress—and exemplifies the
caste system in its most efficient
operation.

There is more than one way to
be a Feminist, or even a Radical
Feminist; there are important
issues and trivial ones; there are
concessions we all make to sur-
vival and comfort. To make each
other feel guilty or less woman-
ly; to perceive ourselves in the
role of exemplar of
Feminism—or even more
destructively, as inadequate at
Feminism—will drain energy
that should be used for creative
and constructive solutions to our
differences and difficulties.

The games I have discussed
here are ones which I play all the
time, and help others to play.
They are especially prevalent
among white Feminists with
middle-class origins. To deny
our origins is to deny our roots;
but recognition of the sources of
fear and games will strengthen
us. We owe it to each other to
stop playing and start challenging
each other to grow.

Rebels or Collaborators
Raps Florynce Kennedy

Carolyn Agosta

Once more Denver received
an earful in the form of Florynce
Kennedy, radical, Black,
Feminist lawyer. Her “rap”
began with four songs, three of
which are take-offs from the
originals, “Richard, the Red-
Necked Reindeer,” “Abortion
Rap,” “Striped Christmas,” and
“God Rest Ye Merry
Gentlemen.” Since she was
speaking at the University of
Colorado Medical Center, her
talk centered around the

medical profession. She stated
that the health community has
been neutral in the past...but
that now, no one can be
neutral...we are either rebels or
collaborators.

“Women are still studying
nursing and if there ever was a
group of ‘niggerized,
niggerizers,’ it's the nurses.”
Niggerization is a divide and con-
quer technique, a sort of DandC
Strategy, and is a part of the mid-
dle class. But according to her
claim, there is no real middle
class, since 90% of the country is
poor and the other 10% is rich.
This was demonstrated during
the tornadoes. People who had
been labeled “middle class” lost
their mortgaged homes, cars;
people who had thought that
they were ‘above’ welfare,
suddenly were forced to turn to it
for help. This “instant niggeriza-
tion” brought on many symptoms,
like paranoia, that are
associated with poor people.

M.D. Fetus-fetish

Ms. Kennedy talked about the
nursing profession and the
whole medical profession as not
being ‘absolutely dedicated,’
that politics plays a large role in
them. Gynecological

departments are heavily
dominated by Catholic men,
fetus-fetish M.D.s, who take the
stand that any woman who
wants to terminate a pregnancy

is only going through a ‘phase’
and when the time comes, she
will “happily” become a mother.
(??) She spoke of the medical
profession losing the mythical
respect of the poor. The profes-
sion needs to reach into the
community and bring “the
message from the outside in.”
Since there is very little light
coming into the profession, peo-
ple think that doctors are always
right.

Another interesting point that
Ms. Kennedy mentioned was the
fact that “up until 1869, the
Catholic Church allowed abor-
tions of a fetus that was male up
to 40 days and a fetus that was
female up to 80 days.” (That
should be a good clue as to what
the church thinks about us
(women!!?) Now the Catholic
Church is in the forefront with its
concerns about continuing un-
wanted pregnancies...

Breakdown Elitism

Flo Kennedy praised the CU
Medical Center Women's
Caucus (who had sponsored
her). It started around faculty
and now includes students and
clerical personnel, which has
very much enriched it. ""The
hierarchical professional elitism
is breaking down.”

To close, here is a quote from
Flo Kennedy, call it a thought for
every day: “Anyone who is close
enough to hurt us has some
weak point that we can shoot
at.”

Ed's note: Florynce Kennedy is
one of the founders of the
National Organization of
Women, a member of the
National Black Feminist
Organization, co-author of the
book Abortion Rap, and
author of Pathology of Oppression."

WOMEN in the arts

Artists Show Off Talents

r.

Local

Anne Zeigler, Carol Lease

ROCKY MOUNTAIN
WOMEN IN THE ARTS
(RMWA) is a newly-formed,
non-profit group for all area
women interested in com-
munication with other women
artists, in showing and selling
their work, and in establishing
a Center where their efforts
can be centralized and
recognized.

Women working in any art
form are welcome, as are
women who wish to support
the artists’ goals. Specific
group goals range from
consciousness-raising to sales,
in an ultimate effort to en-
courage excellence in women’s
art, RMWA’s most ambitious
hope is to establish a Women’s
Arts Center in Denver where
women can show regularly,
meet and exchange ideas and
experiences, and share ser-
vices and facilities.

Women interested in Rocky
Mountain Women in the Arts
can come to meetings held
every Tuesday evening at 8:00
at 1895 Lafayette Street, or
contact Jan at 388-6590.

Soup’s On Exhibit

The serenity and excellence
of RMWA’s first show at
Soup's On, a downtown
Denver restaurant, belie the
frustration, betrayal, and
struggle that went into setting
it up, and are a tribute to the
resilience and persistence of
the women involved.

According to the two RMWA
members with whom we
spoke, the story goes
something like this:

The group had been discuss-
ing putting on a show or
creating alternatives to
showings when their meeting
was interrupted by a telephone
call from a would-be Sir
Lancelot named Richard Vin-
cent. Vincent offered, as a
political and artistic statement,
to organize a show for RMWA
at Soup's On. He extravagantly
promised to provide free
publicity, lots of wine, and
comprehensive mailing lists.
He offered to make all
arrangements with Soup's On
and with the Friends of the
Denver Symphony, for whom
the show was to be a benefit.

Although some women in
the group were instinctively
turned off by the man, their in-
experience, disorganization,
and lack of confidence made
the idea seem like “an answer
to our prayers.” So the group
made a decision to work with
Vincent.

Sir Lancelot Foiled Again

At this point the deception
began. Vincent changed the
date of the showing without in-
forming anyone, hired an auc-
tioneer that he said had had
considerable experience, but
who in fact had had none at all,
and had invitations printed that
did not even mention the art
show, thus forcing the women
to redo them. Despite such ob-
vious deviations from the truth,
Vincent's air of
professionalism, in demanding
deadlines, in seeming to know
so much, was still convincing
to the RMWA women; and it
wasn’t until almost show time
that the women realized how
thoroughly they had been con-
ned.

Despite all the frustration in
putting the show together, and
despite Vincent's “help,”
despite the fact that few, if any,
of the “Friends of the Denver
Symphony” showed up, and
despite the refusal of the
owners of the show to exhibit
two works by Fran Gottlieb
which they called “obscene,”
the show was a financial and
emotional success. Rocky
Mountain Women in the Arts
has made and is making money
from the show.

RMWA Grows

Rather than being destroyed
by their betrayal by Vincent,
the RMWA women have been
strengthened. “We learned not
to depend on others to do our
work for us. We learned to talk
about our mistakes. We see
that our group was essentially
used by a man trying to make
a name for himself.""

This summer RMWA will
participate in the Street
Festival in Denver (the date of
which has not been set). It is
organizing shows and doing
some consciousness-raising.
The RMWA women are all con-
cerned with being women ar-
tists, and there is great diversi-
ty among group members as to
whether “women” receives
the emphasis or “artists.” They
welcome all women.

“Ladies of Mexico” by Carole Katchen

Judy Chicago says women’s art comes from an inner sanctum, and
this makes women’s art intrinsically different from men’s. She has
observed four patterns in women’s art. Maryse Holder in Off Our
Backs, “...repeating forms (cylinders for instance); circular forms
(deriving from the breast perhaps); organic forms (she calls these
“biomorphic”). Examples would be plants, genitalia, gardens. ...Cen-
tral aperture, the representation of an opening in the center of a pain-
ting. These openings could appear as hearts of flowers (O'Keeffe), or
as tunnels or portals leading to a mysterious infinity beyond.”

Organic Imagery

However, organic imagery is not limited to women. I think the early
Egyptian, Byzantine, and African art to be very biomorphic and organic
in form. They possessed those same smooth curving planes as the
Surrealists later developed. Arp, Dali, Ernst, Miro, Fini, Moore, Oelze,
Oppenheim, Tanguy, and Toyen all expressed themselves with
dynamic organic and biomorphic forms, whether in painting or in
sculpture. Surrealism is these forms—not from the exterior realistic
world; but from the interior, the unconscious and the imagination.
“Expressing inner perceptions visually,” as Andre Breton put it.

Organic and biomorphic imagery have been around since the
earliest artists, and have been created successfully by men and
women. Women have also created concrete and realistic imagery and
forms. Cindy Nemser and Irene Moss from The Feminist Art Journal
express their viewpoints:

Other critics, such as Linda Nochlin and myself, are unable to pick
out any all-prevailing traits in either painting or sculpture that will im-
mediately proclaim it to be the art of a woman. This is hardly strange,
as psychologists and biologists have been unable to discover any
definitive relationship between female hormones and female ar-
tifacts. Moreover, since the two sexes have jointly built and par-
ticipated in similar cultures, it seems rather unlikely that the art of each
sex should be highly distinctive from that of each other. At this time,
however, our total culture is in a stage of transition and evolution. A
new woman is emerging, a woman who is often setting herself apart
from man, or at least is in opposition to him in order to sound forth her
own individual voice. Why not wait, hold back, and examine each in-
dividual sound for its own rhythm, beauty, and harmony as it appears
or has appeared in the recent past? Why work in the old way to create
an amorphous category and dump all females into it? All women are
not alike.” —Cindy Nemser.

Women artists should be able to paint “tender” paintings if that is
what they want to do or “bold” ones if they are so inclined, or “circles”
but, in any case, only because that is what they want to do and not
because they have a hang-up about their wombs.” —Irene Moss

Art history has relegated women to either the “decorative arts and
crafts,” or to the back pages behind men. The art world is run
predominantly by men, for male collectors and buyers, and for male
critics and jurors. Many women, art separatists as well as those who
believe art is art (men and women have equal talent but are not equal
in the art world) have found the need for an alternative system. Art
collectives and women’s galleries have shot up throughout the coun-
try, Denver notwithstanding.

Review

The Rocky Mountain Women’s
Art Show, May 1-25 at Soup’s
On restaurant in downtown
Denver was the first attempt of
area women collectively making
an effort to show and sell their
work. They couldn't have chosen
a better place for ex-
posure...downtown, crowds at
lunch time, and an almost
gallery effect from the interior
design of the restaurant. For a
first timer it was good. A lot of
women were represented and
quite a few sold; there were also
a good number of methods and
media shown—plastic arts,
prints, photographs, sculpture,
pottery, and fibers. However, the
overall quality of the work left a
lot to be desired. Sloppy techni-
que and poor realization of the
subject matter predominated.
Barbara Baer and Carol Katchen
offered the best in my eyes.

Carol Katchen had a series of
black and white prints. She uses
smooth, clean and strong lines,
expressing movement vividly.
“Fire,” a woman bent over
backwards on her legs and hips,
emanates grace and passion and
lots of energy. Barbara Baer had
two sculptures, “Chain Gang”
and “Anthro-Lectric.” “Chain
Gang” is a simple sculpture
made from plexiglass and small
link chains. The coloring and the
simple forms produced provide a
compelling design which is high
in originality. Her other piece ex-
hibited was an organic, breasty-
looking light structure. The form
is great; all I can say is it’s
beautiful and very refreshing to
see good modern sculpture
small and concise.

I am glad the show was put on
and hope there will be others, for
each of us has to work, develop
and grow with our art.

The Twenty-Second Annual
Metropolitan Show at the
Denver Art Museum came in
with over one-third of its works
produced by women. The best,
without any doubt in my mind,
was “Rocking Chair” by Marilyn
Martin. It’s a plexiglass rocking
chair with solid smooth planes;
the seat is a clear box half-filled
with different colored pebbles
and water. It reminds me of a
mountain pool, so cool and
smooth, while I rock in the chair,
daydreaming of putting my hand
in the slightly greenish water.

Kay Koch-Brown had a good
entry. Her technique is good, her
colors defined but subtle; yet her
subject matter leaves a lot to be
desired. I am not too partial to
mid-western regionalism,
though if you have nostalgia for
tractors in Kansas you would
hang it in your living room and
dream on.

“The Go Game” by Susan
Walp was recommended for a
one-person show. I was greatly
surprised; it was one of the
worst things in the show. It was
poor technically, unsanded sur-
face with lots of air holes, poor
brush stroking and muddy color-
ing. The subject matter was bor-
ing, not even inspiring your im-
agination to wander.

Other outstanding con-
tributions were made by Alice
Abrams, “Flame ring hanging,”
a beautifully simple sculptured
ring; Becky Clune, “Myth,” an
attractively designed neckpiece
made from silver, brass, amber,
garnets, and bone; “Bread Box
—B.L.T.” Peg Goldberg evoked
the pop art imagery of the sixties.
A larger than life B.L.T. staring at
you in the face brings back the
smells of the “round the corner.”

MARTIN/LYON

Metivists, Authors, Lesbian

Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin are probably the first two women you
ever hear about in terms of national exposure about being Lesbians.
In 1955 they started one of the first organizations in the country for
Lesbians and they have been active ever since, first with the Civil
Rights Movement, then with Gay Liberation, and now they are work
ing primarily within the Women's Movement. Sometimes referred to

affectionately as the “Mothers of Lesbian Liberation,”
they recently published a book called Lesbian/Woman, 
which has been a proud act
in Denver on April 5 to do as
the University of Denver Center and it was
Big Mama Rag (by Janet Sergi) and 
others who “picked their brains”

about being both

Lesbians and Mothers.

For information on the Women’s Movement,
we sought out Del and Phyllis, two of the first
engagements at Colorado University
to see that several women from

the Daughters of Bilitis, the recently-formed San Francisco
Lesbian Mothers Union and anything else we could think of.

Although they graciously gave us a two-hour interview and supplied
us with a wealth of information, we were only able to reprint a portion of
that interview here. The following are excerpts.

Choc: Do you see the Women's
Movement as just a civil rights
movement, or do you see it as a
lot more than that?

Phyllis: I think it’s both. The
Women’s Movement is running
on a lot of different levels so you
have women doing things from a
lot of different levels of con-
sciousness. NOW has primarily
aimed at civil rights, but there’s a
lot of awareness among NOW
women that they also need to
deal in terms of what's going to
happen in the future — what
kind of society do we want — and
what in the hell are we talking
about when we talk about
revolution.

Del: What kind of a society do we
want to live in? We may think in
terms of what could happen in
the next 5 or 10 years, but we
have to go way beyond that. We
think it is very necessary for
there to be some women’s think
tanks where different women
from various groups really get
together and start thinking about
the future and what is it we want
in this society. So we would like
to see Feminists rally all over the
country doing this sort of thing.
And then maybe getting
together later to see what all
we've come up with, you know,
sort of brainstorming.

Phyllis: There are a lot of women
who have decided maybe
socialism or Marxism or
whatever “ism” is the answer,
but it doesn't necessarily seem
to me in view of what we've seen
of socialist societies that that’s
really the answer for women and
gay people anyhow. I have not
seen any societies evolving
around the world that I would be
comfortable living in in terms of
being a woman and being a gay
person.

Del: Not only that. At least in this
society we know who the enemy
is, we know what we're dealing
with. Some of these other con-
cepts — like a socialist govern-
ment — would just change the
name of my oppressor and I
wouldn't have the advantage of
at least knowing the structure
and knowing the society I'm
dealing with. You talk about
revolution — you turn things up-
side down — but the way I see it
now, certainly gay people would
still be oppressed.

Phyllis: You don’t want to turn it
around so that we still end up on
the bottom.

Choc: Do you think that all
women are, or should be,
Lesbians, in order for a real
women’s revolution to take
place?

Del: Speaking personally, I'm
certainly not a Separatist. I don’t
see how you can do away with
half the population of the world. I
also wouldn’t want to live in just
a gay society. I'm really in-
terested in all human beings. I
think there needs to be a lot of
consciousness-raising...a lot of
changes in society. Every in-
stitution needs to be turned up-
side down. Some women who
want to separate out — who
don't even want to have their boy
children — this is counter-
revolutionary. I think I’m too
much of a humanist to buy all
that.

Phyllis: Yeah, I'd agree with that.
As far as all women being
Lesbians, I think certainly all
women have that potential. Or
even more broadly, all people
really have the capacity to relate
to both sexes — on a sexual
basis. A lot of switching is
happening within the Feminist
movement. A lot of women are
becoming aware of either their
own inherent Lesbianism that
they weren't aware of, or were
afraid to face. Or simply that it’s
a lot easier to deal with women
nowadays than it is to deal with
men. I've never quite been able
to understand why everybody

freaks out — all the heterosex-
uals seem to think somehow or
other that if we loosen up the
laws on homosexuality,
everybody is going to turn gay.
I've really always had a little
more faith in heterosexuality
than that — than they seem to
have.

Janet: What do you think about
the concept of a woman's
culture? The Women’s Move-
ment is not just a civil rights
movement and it’s not exactly a
humanist movement. At this
time in history, we have to focus
on women and the concept of a
woman’s culture with woman's
art philosophy, critiques of the
male-dominated culture. What
are your views on that aspect of
Feminism?

Phyllis: I think it’s really exciting
— the kinds of things that are
happening. I think that a
woman's culture is not
necessarily being developed —
it's being dredged up out of
where it’s been. It isn’t as if we
haven't ever had a women’s
culture — it’s been suppressed,
repressed, never discussed,
nobody knew about it. Now it’s
being pulled together so that
more and more women are
becoming aware of the
capacities of women to create.
Marge: I understand you are the
co-founders of the Lesbian
Mothers Union, or helped to
found it. What is this organiza-
tion, what is it all about?

Del: The Lesbian Mothers Union
grew out of the Gay Women's
West Coast Conference in 1971.
At this point I threw out the idea
that there were Lesbian mothers
and that their issues were not
being dealt with either in the gay
movement or in the Women’s
Movement. All of a sudden we
had a bunch of women deman-
ding a workshop and also
questioning why we didn’t have
child care there. Nobody ever
thought in terms of having child
care at a Lesbian conference
because of literature that’s been
handed down by the
professionals who talk about
sexual behavior rather than the
whole person — who might be a
gay person even though there
are lots of women who are ac-
ting out heterosexual roles.
We've been following all the
different custody cases and
helping and supporting women
who have custody cases going.
Then we also have rap sessions
where women can discuss some
of the problems they have with
their children, with their
neighbors, within the family —
how do you tell your kids? Are
you open in front of the kids?...
They also have socials where
they get their families together
because they think it is impor-
tant for the children to have
peers who are in the same
situations...
Marge: You said earlier you con-
sider Lesbianism to be the
backbone of the Women’s Move-
ment. Why do you think that?

Phyllis: There’s just so many of
us in it and we all seem to be do-
ing a lot of work. And we don’t
have to ask our husbands if it’s
all right for us to go to the NOW
meeting or whatever meeting.
We're free to get involved. DOB
(Daughters of Bilitis — the first
Lesbian organization in the U.S.
—Ed.) was essentially a
women's rights organization
from the beginning. It didn’t real-
ly quite know that’s what it was,
but a lot of the things DOB was
saying in the late 50’s and 60's
are the same kinds of things that
the Women’s Movement is say-
ing now. Since Del got on the
national board of NOW, we dis-
covered there are all these gay
sisters who are presidents of
NOW chapters and who are very
involved on this level or that
level. And more and more all the
time are coming out and being
open about it. There's just really
no question that a lot of the work
and a lot of the creativity and a
lot of the blood, sweat and tears
in the Women’s Movement has
come from gay women, mostly
gay women in the closet until
fairly recently.

Phyllis Lyon

Choc: You've been working with
Lesbians for a number of years. I
wonder if you could tell us of
some of the changes you've
seen. How would you compare,
say, working with Lesbians in
1974 to working with Lesbians
when you first started
Daughters of Bilitis?

Del: In the first place, it's Bilitis
(Bilitis)... a

Choc: I never did know how to
pronounce that.

Del: Bilitis makes it sound like
tonsillitis and a disease, and
we're trying to get away from
the disease concept. There's just
been tremendous changes.
When we first came out so to
speak, everybody was into the
whole butch-femme trip. You
found that that was the way you
had to act in order to be accepted
by your peers, and of course,
everybody's looking for a support
group, so we got into the role-
playing in the beginning. Except
I had a problem playing the butch
role — I was a pretty sissy butch.
I remember there were eight of
us who'd started DOB — four
couples, and there was one
other couple that the butch
didn’t seem so butchy either so
she and I became buddies. We
began to get into more discus-
sion and we decided we should
be developing our own ways of
relating instead of imitating the
only relationships we'd had as a
model — the heterosexual one.
We would have to really start to
think in terms of how best we
could work out our own
relationships and not do this im-
itation thing. As we delved into
that we began to realize then the
whole thing about sex roles —
what are called masculine and
feminine are indeed human
traits and that we all have these
varying traits to varying degrees
and that what society had been
handing down was really a
cultural thing because in other
cultures the role could be reversed.

Marge: I'd like to play the devil's
advocate for a few minutes
because in doing panels, es-
pecially in high schools, one of
the most sensitive areas is that
of gay parents and the children
in that situation.

Phyllis: That is a problem. Any
child growing up in any kind of
“deviant” family, whether it’s
hippy, divorced, poor, rich, if
they're different than their peer
group, they're going to have
some kind of trouble with their
peers. I almost died the first time
I had to go to school wearing
glasses. Everybody knew boys
never make passes at girls who
wear glasses. In those days that
was the feeling. So you cannot
protect kids from what's gonna
happen in the outside world. But
that's not a reason not to be open
and honest with your kids. You
can't raise your kids and never
tell them you're a Lesbian
they'll have all these strange
feelings about what's going on
with their mother and who are
these strange women that come
in and you never see any kind of
affection, they never know about
love between adults. That seems
to me to be a lot worse than
somebody yelling on the
playground, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah
your mother’s a Lesbian,” or
something like that. If you give
the child the support within the
home so that the child un-
derstands the whole situation
and understands why the kids
are going to yell that, it's not a
pleasant thing for them, but they
can certainly deal with the other
kids, deal with a hell of a lot. And
I think they can deal with that kind
of thing a lot better than with
growing up in an anti-affection
home or in a home where they
always know there’s something
there that they can’t quite put
their finger on. And where the
mother’s miserable. It's like kids
that grow up in families where
the parents stay together for the
sake of the children, the kids
always know there's something
wrong. Kids are very perceptive.
Marge: You mentioned that in
addition to your book
Lesbian/Woman that you have
two other publications?

Phyllis: We've done a little
booklet through the National Sex
Forum called Lesbian Love and
Liberation, which is illustrated
with photographs of gay women.

‘Rooming-in’~ Outdated?

This is a column for men and  
children as well as for women.  
This is a column about the first  
hours and days of child care.  
Since the woman is central  
physiologically in the childbirth  
process, we must reclaim our  
rights from the hospital and the  
doctor. This means knowing  
what is available today in the  
hospital, knowing what we want  
and why we want it. This means  
having the facts that give us the  
courage to stand against male  
mate and male doctor if their  
opinions are different than ours.  
(The subject here is limited to  
hospital deliveries though some  
of the ideas may relate to home  
delivery as well.)

“Rooming-in” refers to the  
newborn child’s remaining with  
the mother in her room almost  
immediately after birth through  
discharge from the hospital. This  
was the usual arrangement in all  
U.S. hospitals until the turn of  
the century, and there never has  
been nurseries for normal new-  
borns in most European  
hospitals. So why did the new-  
born nursery, with strictly  
limited parent-child interaction,  
become the norm in this coun-  
try? I have been able to find only  
suggestions, not definite  
answers.

Possible Answer

One possible answer is the  
worry over infection. It should be  
remembered that at this time  
most deliveries were still done at  
home. Women entering the  
hospital were often otherwise ill  
or had problem pregnancies. These  
women and their babies went to  
large open wards rather than to  
rooms of two to four women as is  
done today. Screening techni-  
ques for disease organisms  
were primitive or nonexistent, so  
an infected woman's bacteria or  
virus literally flew around the  
ward finding easy prey in the  
debilitated women and the new-  
borns. However, it has since  
been clearly shown that  
“rooming-in” is actually safer  
than nurseries with respect to  
infection.

At the turn of the century, a  
French doctor, Pierre Budin, was  
busy popularizing nurseries and  
incubators for premature in-  
fants. Budin sent a young stu-  
dent, Martin Cooney, to exhibit  
his methods at fairs in England  
and the United States. Cooney  
finally settled on Coney Island  
where, in 39 years, he raised  
over 5,000 premature infants.

Why the ideas for premature  
infants came to be applied to all  
infants may have to do with  
Cooney’s commercial success.  
For whatever reasons, nurseries  
soon became the rule in our  
hospitals. With this separation  
often went other rigid rules  
which discouraged breast  
feeding and depersonalized the  
childbirth process. Healthy  
women, eager to care for their  
new children, were treated as in-  
valids. Fathers were often  
treated as intruders.

Today there is a swing back to  
“rooming-in” and other more  
open procedures, but this swing  
has been slow getting started.  
The roots go all the way back to  
some problems recognized by  
Budin and Cooney, who ran into  
many trouble spots as well as  
benefits with their procedures.  
One big problem was getting  
mothers to accept their children  
after the long period of separa-  
tion caused by using nurseries.

Slow Start

Then in the late 1940s, Duke  
Hospital decided on an ex-  
perimental program of com-  
pulsory rooming-in. Interesting-  
ly, the rationale used was similar  
to that for instituting the nursery  
system in the first place—  
prevention of infection. The  
biggest obstacle wasn't con-  
vincing the mothers; it was the  
obstetricians and nurses who  
objected. Though prevention of  
infection was the motivation for  
the experiment, the primary  
rewards were psychological and  
educational.

Over twenty-five years later,  
“rooming-in” is still the excep-  
tion in U.S. hospitals, but  
evidence in its favor is piling up.  
Some of this research is review-  
ed in an outstanding article,  
which I recommend in its entire-  
ty to all of you. This is “Mothers  
separated from their newborn  
infants” by Marshall H. Klaus  
and John H. Kennell in Pediatric  
Clinics of North America, vol.  
17, no. 4, November, 1970.

Part II of this article, which dis-  
cusses specific ideas for  
women who are considering  
“rooming-in”, will be published  
next month. — Ed.

Note: Nothing has yet been  
decided about the legality and  
limits of midwifery in Colorado.  
We will report what is happen-  
ing as soon as anything does  
happen.

‘Girls,’ Start Cheering!

by Becky Bohannan

Athletics is a field which men have dominated ever since the  
Olympics of ancient Greece. But lately, with the Billie Jean King-  
Bobby Riggs exhibition and such heartthrobs as Olga Korbut, more  
and more people are taking an interest in women’s athletics. With  
this newly acquired enthusiasm, I investigated Cherry Creek High  
School's sports program. What I discovered simply reaffirmed my  
initial impression, that though the situation is not without hope,  
sexism abounds in the athletic department.

Cherry Creek offers thirteen  
varsity sports for boys, plus  
junior varsity, freshman, and  
sophomore teams. It offers the  
girls a grand total of five, which  
are gymnastics, swimming, ten-  
nis, track, and field hockey. The  
situation is improving. For the  
last ten to fifteen years (accor-  
ding to one coach) girls have  
been playing volleyball and  
basketball on the chance that  
these sports would become  
sanctioned by the Colorado High  
School Athletic Association.  
Now finally, both sports have  
been sanctioned for next year,  
which means they will be able to  
receive funds out of the activities  
budget and play in a regular  
league.

Pat Morgan is a member of the  
girls’ track team in which her  
events are discus and shot-put.  
She is also on the volleyball  
team. Pat has a number of com-  
plaints about the sports  
program. Speaking on the small  
amount of funds granted to girls’  
teams, she says, “Boys get this  
and boys get that and they  
always come first in equipment  
and privileges. No attention is  
given to the girls.” The coach of  
one of the girls’ teams says the  
same thing. She could not quote  
the figures exactly, but there is a  
large difference between the  
amount of funds the boys received  
compared to the amount girls  
sports receive. She also  
protested the fact that in the  
sport she coaches, she is ex-  
pected to coach her entire team  
herself while the boys’ team of  
the same sport has a coach and  
two assistant coaches. Each  
team has an equal amount of  
participants and events. “I’m try-  
ing to do an impossible job,” she  
says, “if I'm to come out with a  
winning team.”  
Tiny Articles

Girls’ sports are rarely  
publicized to any extent, a fact  
which especially bothers Pat.  
“There's almost never anything  
in the school paper about the  
girls’ sports except maybe some  
real tiny article. The girls’ swim  
team puts up their own signs. No  
one comes to watch the track  
team. Oh, at the district and  
state meets there will be a few  
people, but otherwise it’s zilch.  
Of course, we don't have a fan  
club following us around. In pep  
assemblies, you never hear  
about girls’ sports. The boys’  
football team has been in-  
troduced so many times you  
know every single guy. But the  
girls’ teams are never in-  
troduced. If they did, I don’t think  
the boys would take it.”  

In looking through the  
school’s annual for the last two  
years and back issues of its  
newspaper, it became evident  
that Pat had every right to com-  
plain. Cherry Creek's 1972 an-  
nual contained 22 pages  
devoted to sports. Four of these  
were about girls’ sports. The  
amount of space allotted to girls’  
sports actually declined in ‘73  
with only two pages representing  
two of the five sports. A  
number of issues of the paper  
didn't even mention any girls’  
sports. Others had one article or  
possibly two. None were in a  
prominent position on the page.  
Most of the articles just gave a  
straight news story.

One article with the title  
“Women’s Lib in Sports,” (from  
The Union St. Journal, Sept. 21,  
1973) stood out from the rest. Its  
introductory paragraph began,  
“In the age of male dominance,  
the female role in sports was sit-  
ting on the sidelines cheering on  
the varsity (all male) teams.  
Now, however, the girls are  
realizing how much exercise  
conditions their figures, keeping  
them slimmer, trimmer, and  
generally good looking...”  
“Can't Leave Out Girls’’

Another example of the con-  
descending attitude toward  
girls’ sports appeared in an arti-  
cle written by a coach. He spoke  
of the outlook for the spring  
sports program and mentioned  
all the boys’ teams and a number  
of male individuals. At one point  
he stated, “...and yes, we cannot  
leave out the girls’ program...,”  
which was the only mention of  
girls in the entire article. This  
statement seems to reflect the  
general opinion of the school.  
‘Let's not forget the girls’ but  
that’s exactly what people do.  
Forget the girls.

The major complaint of the  
two women interviewed is the  
way in which men react to them,  
especially men also involved in  
athletics. “What really upsets  
me,” said the coach, “is that too  
many of the student body and es-  
pecially the boys involved in  
athletics, cut down the girls who  
go out for sports.” Being an ob-  
ject of this contempt, Pat said, “I  
get the impression sometimes  
that we're really looked down  
on. Especially in my event 'cause  
most girls don’t go around lifting  
weights.” She then went on to  
say, “The most recognized girls’  
sport at Cherry Creek is Pom-  
Pom, Cheerleading. Wow! It's  
fine to be a cheerleader but is  
that all the girls can be? The boys  
have the idea of putting us in the  
category of cheerleaders so that  
we can idolize them with their  
great accomplishments, not to  
be equal but to stay below and  
idolize, well FORGET IT!""

Contemptuous Treatment

If Cherry Creek is any indica-  
tion of other high schools, girls’  
athletic programs are neglected  
by school administrations and  
actually treated with contempt  
among certain students. But the  
situation is changing slightly. In  
the last two years, two new  
sports have been added to the  
program and two more will be  
added next year. This could easi-  
ly be attributed to the Feminist  
movement, which has  
generated all the publicity and  
discussion of equal rights. The  
climate was right to expand the  
girls’ program. The contempt  
shown for girls in sports by  
athletic boys is probably their  
natural negative reaction to  
change that confronts their  
stereotypes of the role of women  
that we have all been indoctrinated with.

All Pat and others like her are  
asking for is a change. “Athletic  
girls just don’t have a fair chance  
to progress. None. Girls that  
want to compete should be able  
to. We have the same  
capabilities. We can compete  
against other women in the  
same events men compete in.  
But we're never given any  
recognition.” Well, the male  
athletic establishment had  
better beware, women athletes  
not only have the drive to com-  
pete, they also have the drive to  
prove themselves, and they will."

Dear Sisters,

I enjoy BMR. It’s kind of nice to feel part of something warm and unified and moving and whole. Some people call it Feminism.

To our sisters in Denver,

A group of ten women here in Albuquerque have come together to form the Labe Collective. We are concerned primarily with the Lesbian community and have begun to try to create an alternative to the bar. We have already had various activities and will continue to do so until we have raised enough money to put a down payment on a building located centrally in the City.

One of the ideas that has been discussed is a Summer Solstice Celebration to be held on property located on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest approximately 90 miles northwest of Albuquerque. Preparations are already being made; we want your help; we would like to have you join us in getting it together, i.e., planning and conducting workshops, etc. We think it will be fruitful to provide a variety of entertainment, booths, workshops and daycare, not systemized but structured enough so that it would be a creative learning experience, not just a tribal stomp run through a haze of alcohol and dope. We invite the women of Colorado to participate in any way they so desire through the above mentioned concepts.

We will be facing some problems and need many ideas to deal with them. Some of these problems are: cooking facilities, water facilities, sanitary facilities, daycare, information services. We would like to deal with these problems in the safest and most ecologically sound manner. We would like to provide a large main shelter in case of rain and a large communal cooking area. We feel the best way to deal with the sanitary question is to bury evacuation and deposit paper in a fire. We would like to set up an area and have personnel for daycare so that women with young children can enjoy the festival without the constant demands of their children.

Some of the activities we would like to provide are booths so that women with arts and crafts may have an opportunity to sell their wares, food booths for women with special interests in cooking, one-day workshops including Yoga, breathing, coming, sun-bathing, cloud watching, massage, mandala-making, silent hikes, Sufi dancing, an all-inclusive Essence of Women trip. Other workshops may include self-help, women and the law, occult studies, etc.

Any suggestions, help, participation, energy, love are welcome.

This festival will be free. The booths will cost approximately $2.00 a day to rent. We ask that sisters bring their own food, water and sleeping bags for 2 days of celebration.

Dear Sisters:

As a Lesbian peer counsellor and a resource person for matters Feminist in New Jersey and Lesbian Nation-wide, I was glad to receive the April 1974 issue of Mama Rag and especially the listing of the Colorado contacts. I see that Love/Abbott AND Martin/Lyon both spoke in your area—wow! They haven't even done so in New York!

Denver/Boulder had a DOB for a short while, but there seemed to be multiple hassles, and they dissolved a long time ago. I have no idea whether any of the women on your publication were ever connected with DOB.

I was interested in the page concerned with individual women’s stories of their personal developments, and was amazed at one woman's change from Feminism into the Left. Most of the women I knew did this in reverse, which would be my own position. But I guess we each have a different drummer to follow.

As a Lesbian I am totally committed to the female cause—although I have more disagreements than agreements with the more conservative portion of the movement, principally NOW. Yet we do work with them in New Jersey. I cannot see my lot with the Left at all, since I consider them not only sexist, but anti-gay basically.

Glad things are going great guns in Colorado. At least you got rid of the pesky sodomy laws—something we haven't done yet here.

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I’d like to share with Big Mama Rag readers my response to the NOW panel on Lesbianism and my changing perspective.

NOW was criticized for not inviting a Dyke Separatist to participate on the panel. The person responsible for organizing the panel had had previous experience with Dyke Separatists. Her experience was that wherever Dyke Separatists are included on panels the atmosphere fills with animosity and hatred, and that energies converge on the issue of separatism to the total exclusion of other Lesbian perspectives. She felt that since this was the first panel on Lesbianism at NOW, she preferred there be a broader based discussion this time and that issues of Dyke Separatism be discussed at another time.

Secondly, this panel was essentially an exchange by the Gay Coalition of Denver and NOW. April 16th two NOW women presented a panel at the Coalition general meeting. Lesbian panel members did not presume to represent all aspects of Lesbian perspectives.

Thirdly, I want to point out a double-standard I see inherent in this Dyke Separatist criticism of NOW. I hear the Separatists saying to NOW women: “You should have invited us. You should want us although we want nothing to do with you. You are all wrong and we are all right.”

If you want to speak to a NOW general meeting, Separatists, why don’t you go to the NOW board and tell them what you want? NOW women aren't mind-readers. I don’t understand why it’s important to you to zap a NOW meeting since you detest NOW women and don't want to work with them anyway.

During the evening the zappers criticized me for wearing earrings, for my clothing choice, for my choice of words, for my political priority — working on a state anti-discrimination bill. Sounds to me like they’re on the same old trip — intolerance of diversity and imposition of their values on me — just like out there in the macrocosm — whites imposing their values on blacks, Chicanas, Indians, etc.; straights on gays, men on women.

As I see it, it’s very important to you Separatists that I be just like you. It’s very important to me that all of us cultivate a climate in which we feel free to express our uniqueness rather than demand conformity of one another.

I am reminded of the medical model with which psychiatrists relate to people. This is a belief system which focuses on illness: what's wrong with you or me. Inherent in this perspective is the assumption that only certain people have the knowledge of what's wrong, and can, therefore, make the diagnosis — tell us what our wants and needs should be.

In the field of mental health, psychiatrists, of course, hold this power position. So that a depressed housewife is sick — she needs to become a better wife, mother, or whatever. A Lesbian is a Lesbian because she got screwed up in her sexual preference — she had bad experiences with men and all she really needs is a good fuck (by a man of course and of course this “good” fuck will change her sexual orientation).

The only difference in this particular situation is that it’s the Separatists who have taken the power position, the assumption of the “correct” value system, and have applied it to me, other Lesbians and NOW women. We “deviate” from the Separatists’ model code of good behavior. The terms used are different but the essence is the same. Because I wear clogs, corduroy jeans, a turtleneck top and earrings, I'm a classist. Somehow I don’t quite see the connection between what I choose to wear and how my choice discriminates against Separatists. I haven't determined for them what they should wear.

My choice of words somehow comes out of the Separatists’ version of the sickness model as being a reflection of my intellectualism. I feel like I'm back in the McCarthy era with that accusation.

In contrast to the medical or sickness model, the model I feel comfortable with is the growth or existential model, in which the focus is on being. This model recognizes and values inner experience and returns the locus of evaluation within the individual from the traditional external sources: God, men, and what will the neighbors think.

Growth is inherent within the

FEMINIST AWARDS OF THE MONTH!

The staff of Big Mama Rag would like to extend our appreciation and 1,000 thank yous to Elissa Meyer and Linda Lane, who resigned this month as co-editors. Where would we have been without you folks? Although Elissa and Linda will be functioning in other capacities on the paper, we wanted everyone to know how much they’ve helped the paper to grow and how much we will miss them as editors.

Where We're At

by Jackie Bryson

During the past four months, the staff of Big Mama Rag has been struggling with its own internal problems, while attempting to slay society's dragon of sexism. We want to share with our readers the process and outcome of our struggles.

In January, the old staff of BMR (approximately eight women) called together women of Denver who were interested in working with the paper. More than 40 women responded. We were delighted with the response, and, quite frankly, overwhelmed with some of the logistics and complexity of feelings that developed with an organization of this size. We tried to adjust our structure to accommodate. We became more hierarchical — with an editorial board, three part-time, paid staff members, and many talented and enthusiastic women who wanted to help. We tried assigning tasks to new people and dispersing responsibilities. Personal contact facilitated the growth of trust and understanding among some women, but frustrations and misunderstandings developed among others on the staff. Some new people felt left out of decision-making; staff members felt overburdened trying to work out feelings and publish a monthly newspaper at the same time. Charges of elitism, Lesbian-overkill, and editorial authoritarianism were made both face-to-face and behind people's backs. We made some mistakes. Some were mended. Some were not. We were getting uptight, so we decided to slow down and take a look at our process.

At a general meeting early in May, we all decided that we needed time to get to know each other, to share ideas and questions, to develop the kind of trust that is essential in working on a women’s paper. We have been taking time to do this, and that is why this issue of BMR is a bit late. We also decided to hold some informal “educational consciousness-raising” sessions (Radical Feminist Theory, Feminist Poetry, Feminist Journalism, and Feminist Photography). We have been discussing our personal and political ideas in these small groups in order to re-define the needs and structure of BMR.

To some extent this has worked. For the women who have stayed with the paper, there is much optimism and a re-commitment to the goal of the paper — to represent a radical feminist point of view in covering local news and feature stories, as well as to continue to develop our theories and practice of a female culture. We have found it necessary again to re-structure our group. Presently, there are 15-20 women who have a firm commitment to the paper, and with a group of this size, we have been able to return to our original structure as a collective. Meetings are held twice a month and business and editorial decisions are made by a consensus of women present at those meetings. Any women participating in decision-making or any solely “creative” aspect of the paper (photography, graphics, writing) is expected to do some share of the footwork involved in keeping the paper operating.

There are other internal decisions we have arrived at which are perhaps too petty and/or too boring to go into here. Mainly we want to let you know that BIG MAMA LIVES! We are alive, healthy, and functioning. We continue to get responses from our readers, but we want (and need) very much to hear more — letters, manuscripts, graphics, photos, etc. In addition, our monthly business meetings will be held on the first Sunday of the month at 10:30 a.m. in the BMR office (1724 Gaylord) and are open to any woman who wants to come."

individual — she is self-  
actualizing until or unless the  
Process is interfered with,  
denied or de-valued. This is a  
particular problem with women  
in America, according to Anne  
Schaef, Feminist therapist. She  
believes that we as women in  
this culture have been trained to  
feel innately inferior and to in-  
validate our own perceptions.  
From there, I think, we go on the  
trip of invalidating other women.

The Separatists spoke of the  
necessity for women to be able  
to defend themselves against  
male physical attacks. I agree —  
I recognize my need to be able to  
defend myself from assault,  
whether my defense be either a  
verbal interruption of a would-be  
rapist’s program or a form of  
physical self-defense — judo,  
karate, etc.

Throughout the past year that  
I've been with the Gay Coalition  
of Denver, I’ve been criticized by  
various Lesbians for working  
with gay men. Again, people  
telling me to deny my positive  
experiences, deny my perspec-  
tive. (Tsk, tsk, Marge, you must  
really be more careful about the  
company you keep. After all you  
are a Lesbian and we all know  
that Lesbians hate men. You're  
going to ruin our reputations if  
you don’t stop this nonsense.’’)

I have felt tremendous support  
from the people in the Coalition.  
In that atmosphere I have felt  
comfortable to be open and have  
grown. As Anne Schaef says,  
“Any way to get somewhere else  
is to be where you are."" My  
awareness has been of gay-  
straight issues and in that  
perspective I have worked.

Now I feel ready to move on —  
I want to work with women in an  
autonomous women’s organiza-  
tion. My decision is not in  
response, however, to the rejec-  
tion and animosity I have felt  
from Dyke Separatists. One  
doesn't grow in an atmosphere  
of fear and contempt.

My perspective is changing.  
The gay-straight issue is no  
longer primary with me. I've ex-  
plored it and now feel the need to  
explore sexism within myself  
and our culture.

better. I was hoping to see more

non-sexism. The women show-

beat the system and proved that  
women can show and sell by  
themselves, and that's the best  
thing to come out of Denver's art

The Oil Crisis?

be sure of is that the oil industry itself will continue to prosper and  
grow. The oil crisis may continue indefinitely for a decade or more or  
we may find a way to end it.

One idea for ending the crisis is to nationalize the oil industry. To ac-  
complish this feat would require something close to a nuclear war  
because of the amount of economic and political power the industry  
wields in relation to the government.

Another idea is to nationalize the oil industry and give the oil  
tycoons the political recognition they deserve in terms of the real  
economic and political power they have. In other words merge the  
government and the corporate state. The way to accomplish this  
merger would be in the form of a monarchy. Originally monarchs  
came into being because people needed to be protected, a King would  
form a band of warriors and promise to defend a tribe or nation of peo-  
ple. The people in return would swear allegiance to the monarch and  
would trust in the King’s discretion as their ruler and governmental  
head. Our civilization (?) has now changed to the point that people do  
not need monarchs to defend them, but they are dependent on a highly  
developed technological economy which has at its base the need for  
oil...

The idea of a monarch has not been without its place in American  
history. There were many people who supported the idea of making  
Washington King after America had won her independence from  
England. The office of the president has many of the vestiges of an-  
cient royalty and the American people have always (WELL, ALMOST  
ALWAYS) encouraged and enjoyed a type of royal pageantry for its  
leaders. A very likely candidate for King in 1976 would be John D.  
Rockefeller (of Standard Oil). Rockefeller wouldn't be losing that much  
and America wouldn't be losing a president, she would be gaining a  
King.

At last the issues of democracy and economics could be clarified.  
People would no longer have to labor under the idea that they are  
working for themselves, that if they could only pull themselves up by  
their own bootstraps or G-Strings (whichever fits) they could be  
successful. Economic feudalism would be the name of the game, and  
now people would know what to call it. People would be working in  
royal factories for the king or some other nobleman. Actually people’s  
existences wouldn't change a lot. The Constitution and the Bill of  
Rights might be abolished, but it’s unpatriotic to exercise those rights  
anyway, so people wouldn't notice that. You might see the Royal Seal  
on gas station signs in place of Standard Oil or Exxon or some other  
brand name. An incredible moral burden would be lifted from the  
shoulders of citizens who had been chasing the elusive concept of  
democracy in a capitalistic economy. Sociologists, psychologists, and  
psychiatrists wouldn't have to be sneaky about socializing people,  
they could just tell them to get back to their class or class-caste, or off  
with their heads.

So you see a monarchy would actually clear up a lot of confusion  
and clarify our society for us. The next time you sit shivering in the  
dark—think in terms of a Royal Standard Oil and ask not what Stan-  
dard Oil can do for you but ask what it can do for the Kingdom.

Dr. Wolf Analyzes Roles

From Page 4  
Wolf, do you think there are  

things happening now that  
might actually be detrimental to  
the Women's Movement?  
Wolf: With any sort of mass  
movement processes of rou-  
tinization set in and people begin  
to take it over. There are definite  
advantages to be gotten from a  
movement. It is made into every-  
day kind of stuff. It’s a conser-  
vative kind of force, and I hope  
this doesn’t happen to the  
Women’s Movement. Then, too,  
some of us who have been active  
are pulling out because we have  
our own personal lives to get  
together. You're doing things out  
here, you're saying things, then  
you're going home and picking  
up the dishes. You've got to do  
something about that. It’s dis-  
honest! It's a continual struggle  
and I think it will be a struggle  
until I die.

BMR, In what directions do you  
see the Women's Movement  
growing?

Wolf: I think we're going to have  
more and more Women’s  
Centers. I think more women are  
going to get into public life,  
which is terribly important in a  
structural way. We're going to  
clean up the language; you know  
people say you're a “sissy” and  
monstrous things like that. And  
this is terribly important; we  
think the way we have words for.  
Women’s Centers are vital;  
libraries are vital.  
Women’s history has to be  
written just as Black history had  
to be written. We've started  
already. Women’s sociology that  
reflects women. We need  
women’s coalitions if we're go-  
ing to hang on to what we've got  
and go forward.

BMR: Do you think women are  
now beginning to identify with  
other women?

Wolf: I think one of the most im-  
portant things to come out of the  
Women’s Movement is the right  
of choice. This requires that  
women be supportive of one  
another. This support is  
something that we're not going  
to get from men. I think that in  
some ways segregation is  
essential for any oppressed group  
because you've got to get it  
together and you've got to have  
some kind of support.

it’s gone.

Another cloud,  
another dream,  
another fantasy takes its place.

Close my eyes,

Photo by Pat Lang

past, present, future,  
happy, happiest, she and me.

Catch the minutes,  
collect the sunshine—  
the fun, the laughter,  
catch it all.

Close your eyes,

run through the fields with me.

Feel the cool wet grass beneath our feet.  
Feel the heat of the sun.

Try to remember the blue skies of early afternoon.  
Watch the sunset and wish you were an artist,  
dashing your brush across your canvas,

capturing the greys, pinks and oranges.

REMEMBER a love—

her smile,

her kind eyes,

her warm soft hands.

She held you against her breast.

She winked and you thought your every bit of being  
would burst with happiness.

Reach out with me,

Really try to touch.

You weren’t meant to touch it all

but believe you can and you may.

Get out of yourself now and share your happiness.  
Share your love

to your wealth.

Believe in your sister.

Give her hours of relief from pain, from worry.  
Give her love—understand.

Touch her heart with all your caring,

touch her mind with yours,

Touch her soft body and be ever so gentle.

Touch her

bring her face a smile in the morning sunlight.

Touch her and hold her in the darkness of late night,  
her sweet breath will sigh before sleep comes.

You'll feel her body come to a calm

and you'll feel peace in your arms

Sleep now,  
be there again tomorrow,

REALLY BE THERE.  
SHE'LL KNOW.

To An Anonymous Woman Disc Jockey  
from an anonymous university secretary

The only reason, frankly,

that I was up so early,

was to take a shower, prepare

my body for the daily sacrifice;  
they pay me to sit at a desk

for eight hours — food

for hungry birds who pick

me clean by five.

So usually I don’t crawl out

until after sunrise, thickly protected  
with sleep like a cheap coat

that unravels slowly as I dance

on top of my brown, wooden

desk and perform all kinds of marvelous feats for money.  
By five, I'm a bloodshot parody of myself.  
But, as I said, I rose early

and turned on the radio — music  
morning jazz a woman's  
voice something about

a sunrise and I opened my door  
and there was rose grey

yellow blue

thank you. —Jeanne Winer

OUR MOTHERS—OURSELVES

Last night, I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
with raging Army feet all cast in silver spurs and I threw up and  
over everything I lay there waiting to be tramped again  
into the floor

she only looked at me—the silver shining from her eyes  
gleaming Army boots inside

When I was young she always listened

fed herself into her young

and never made a sparrow of a noise

We tramped her in the living room

Marched upon her in the garden, buried her with tulip bulbs,  
We pushed her down the stairs

and stuffed her in the kitchen sink to drown.

One time she came around

brandishing a chair into our faces upside down

A Lion Tamer pacing round and round

jabbing at the air and stomping

stomping up and down until she cried

she cried/ran down/slumped down upon the hardwood floor  
Last night I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
The silver tears ran down her eyes

Until I couldn't see her anymore/no more/  

no more...

Chicanas Fight Welfare Injustices

Carol Lease

Chicana Welfare Rights is a
nationally organized, non-
funded group that functions
solely through the volunteer
work of welfare mothers, and
deals principally with welfare
injustice against the Chicano
community. The Chicanas
who founded this organization
had worked with the National
Welfare Rights Organization
which is, according to Patricia
Estrada who works with
Chicana Welfare Rights in
Colorado, “a predominately
black-interest group. One
reason we broke away from
NWRO was that they wouldn’t
recognize the need to have
forms printed in Spanish.”

The national headquarters
of Chicana Welfare Rights is
in Los Angeles with Alicia
Escalante as its head. Nation-
ally, the organization is in the
process of challenging the
Talmadge Amendment Public
Law 92-223 to the Social
Security Act which requires

those in need of public
assistance to register for
employment at the Depart-
ment of Employment or to
participate in the Work Incen-
tive Program (WIN). Locally,
the organization is primarily
fighting the inequities and
injustices of the welfare
system, and has become
involved in cases they term
“Parent Abuse” by the Denver
General Hospital, the Child
Welfare section of the Denver
Department of Welfare and the
Juvenile Courts.

The deaths of two children
earlier this year from child
abuse that wasn't recognized
as such or dealt with by
official agencies despite the
pleas of at least one parent
of one child and hospital and
social agency workers, has
created an “overreactionary
flood of suspected child
abuse and child neglect
cases,” says Ms. Estrada.
These cases have resulted in

Welfare

Amendment

Wages

The Talmadge Amendment to the Social Security Act requires
all those in need of public assistance to either register for work
at the Department of Employment or participate in the Work

Incentive Program (WIN).
The Chicana Welfare Rights
organization believes that to
require people to work when
they need food, clothing and
shelter is in direct contradic-
tion to the philosophy of the
Social Security Act to help
people in need. The Talmadge
Amendment cannot help peo-
ple get off welfare. People are
required to register and to
look for work although jobs do
not exist. If they do find work,
they will work for their welfare
check and not for a minimum
wage. Supportive services,
child care and vocational re-
habilitation necessary to en-
able people to look for jobs
are nonexistent. Government
training programs have failed
to provide employable people.
The rights of women are
denied when a law forces a
woman to work outside the
home. It also ignores the right
of a family to stay together.
“Rider” Not Discussed
The Talmadge Amendment
was approved by both the
House and the Senate as a
rider to a bill which provided
burial payments to bereaved
relatives of deceased service-
men whose bodies could not
be recovered for burial from
Vietnam. Discussion — sur-
rounding the actual Amend-
ment arose from only one
Congressman, Mr. Byrnes of
Wisconsin. He felt that not
enough information nor dis-
cussion had been presented
about the bill. He also pointed
out that the bill had not been
totally printed more than a day
before presentation to enable
time to read and study the bill
- much less approve it.
Congressperson Gross
supported Mr. Byrnes in
stating he had mistakenly

thought he was approving
only a burial bill. However,
Congressperson Mills of Ar-
kansas replied that this was
the same bill Congress had
passed in 1972, but due to
disagreements (not identi-
fied), it was not approved.
Therefore, the only change
required would be to change
1972 to 1973. He also
reasoned that since the
session soon had to adjourn,
there was insufficient time to
explain the bill.

Byrnes withdrew his objec-
tion and the Talmadge A-
mendment was passed unani-
mously by 326 Congressmen
with 105 members absent.

The Chicana Welfare Rights
Organization hopes to call to
the attention of the taxpayers
the fact that most Congress-
men did not even know what
bill they were passing, al-
though they voted on spend-
ing millions of the taxpayers’
dollars. In addition, the
Chicanas are asking for indi-
vidual responses from Con-
gress members as to their
stand on the Talmadge A-
mendment in order to call
their attention to what can be
done.

At present, the Talmadge
Amendment is in its registra-
tion phase in Denver. In the
surrounding rural area, it is
being implemented through a
demonstration project called
the Public Service Employ-
ment (PSE). To date, the
program has been considered
a “success” in lowering the
welfare rolls because people
have not registered. The low
number of registrants is
played up as though welfare
recipients had been placed
into jobs.

PSE Required

The purpose of the Public
Service Employment is to
assist registrants to become
job-ready by giving them the
opportunity to learn new
skills, gain valuable work
experience, and to develop a
work history. Participation is
a requirement for welfare
eligibility. The registrants do
not receive a wage for their
PSE activity. They merely
work for their welfare check.
Another problem is that actual
employment opportunity does
not exist.

PSE participants do not
qualify for union jobs, nor for
unfilled vacant positions if
they are “established” job
positions, or jobs advertised
in the newspapers. PSE
participants qualify only for
“useful public services jobs
not otherwise accomplished.”
Such jobs need not be
full-time either. In other
words, PSEs qualify for the
jobs which don’t exist and are
trained (?) for undefined jobs.

Each registrant is required
to conduct an adequate job
search. If she discourages the
employers to hire her, has a
negative attitude, or in her
personal appearance is unac-
ceptable to employers, she is
considered to have conducted
an inadequate job search and,

therefore, is ineligible for
welfare.
Thus, if she does not have

the money to dress in an
appealing manner for the
employer's eye, she is out of
luck. If she tells the employer
that she does not like the job,
and that she could do
something better for a better
wage, she is out of luck. If she
complains about the condi-
tions surrounding her em-
ployment facilities, she is out

of luck. Her actions will be
considered as discouraging
the employer, and as a
negative attitude. In other
words, she neither has the
right to choose her employer,
nor her working conditions.
Neither does she have the
freedom to dissent, nor to tell
the truth.
WIN Program a Failure

The WIN program is regarded
by many as a failure. Only
11% of 223,302 people en-
rolled were placed in jobs.
Many programs offered meet-
ings and pep talks instead of
training. Fifty percent of the
frustrated, disappointed en-
rollees dropped out of the
programs as a result. Others
were discouraged due to bu-
reaucratic breakdowns which
slowed, or stopped financial
aid. Although many could
have taken advantage of more
meaningful programs out of
WIN, such programs would
not be sanctioned for sti-
pends. Only 40% of those
people placed in jobs are
receiving an annual income.
These jobs still require fami-
lies to stay on welfare. The 67
million dollars spent in the

Bertha Romero is a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand who teaches English to blind students from kindergarten to the eighth grade. She has been in Thailand since January and has the following to say about women in Thai society.

Sumalee is a Thai woman, very verbal and active in women’s rights. She was writing articles every week until recently - about two months ago - and is still behind the lights. Rumor has it that many Thai (both men and women) have been offended by her writings and she was advised to be more careful. Also, there might be fear for her life because she apparently “knows too much.” Another woman journalist, an American named Claudia Ross, was murdered in Bangkok about that same time (two months ago). So things are slowly dying down - it’s funny how the mass media is never really made aware of how things turn out in the end. But she hasn't been writing at all lately.

I've learned too, that Thai women are very aggressive, equal, and outspoken. Sumalee also worked on a draft of the constitution to include women’s rights, wages, improved job conditions, etc. - but the House turned it down. The bill was not published, and the only thing people read in the papers was: “She was asked to remove herself from the room because she had her legs crossed. She refused, stating that all the men had their legs crossed and if she was asked to leave they should be too. (She was also the only woman there.)” She was finally physically removed, I've gathered. And when I mention her name to some Thais, either men or women, they immediately say “She's foolish and nobody pays attention to her anyway.” That’s the way it is in Thailand.

Feminist College to Open

With more than 1,000 colleges offering women’s studies courses and 80 making it possible to earn a degree in the same, is a college devoted to feminism necessary?

Such a college - it will be called an institute - will open in the summer of 1975. Founded by feminist activists, Sagaris will answer the need for the study of unadulterated feminist philosophy.

Dr. Joan Peters, one of the founders, said in an interview that there will be greater academic freedom than found at any college or university offering women’s studies.

“Present courses leave something to be desired,” she said. “In many schools the women’s studies are controlled by men or locked into a system that does not allow adequate freedom for maximum intellectual growth.”

Dr. Peters, of Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt., and Brooklyn, N.Y., told how the institute got its name.

“The name was taken from the Sagaris, the double-edged sword of the ancient Amazons, who, according to mythology, were militant only when necessary to protect themselves from aggressors.”

The Amazons, mythology holds, were powerfully strong women who waged war on the oppressors. Dr. Peters stressed that they take Sagaris in a political and not a military sense.

“Our institute, which we call an institute to allow ourselves the intellectual freedom not possible in establishment colleges, is meant to be a feminist-humanist alternative to existing patriarchal society schools of higher education,” Dr. Peters said.

The founders include writers, teachers, and activists. Among them is Blanche Boyd, author of a book titled “Nerves.” Also involved, according to Dr. Peters, is Ti-Grace Atkinson, pioneer theoretician of the women’s movement in America.

‘Girl’ Gets $9,000.

Mary Joyce, 26, who complained to her boss about calling her “the girl” and a day later she was fired, will get $9,000 from her former employer by order of the New York State Human Rights Division. Miss Joyce said in her complaint she was fired after telling assistant vice president John Maloney of AVCO Financial Services, Inc., she didn't like being called “the girl” when her title was “Commercial Paper Salesperson.”

She said she was called in the next day and dismissed on grounds of “misconduct.” Under a settlement signed by both sides, AVCO will pay her $9,000 and give her a mutually agreed upon letter of recommendation informing future employers she was “capable, competent, and satisfactory.”

Minority Women’s Task Force

Carol Lease

In March the Minority Women’s Task Force of the Denver chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) decided to leave the nationally recognized women’s rights group and become an independent organization, retaining its original name while working on issues directly related to minority women in Colorado. Accounts of the incident were published with an anti-feminist, anti-woman bias. The issues and the ideas of the women involved in the separation were ignored. The following has been written about the split after conversations with Corina Aragon, chairperson of the Minority Women’s Task Force (MWTF) and Charlotte Hebeler, president of the Denver chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW).

The Minority Women’s Task Force was formed to research and act on problems that often disproportionately affect minority women rather than non-minority women. The Woman's Prison at Canon City is currently one focal point for action. Some women on the Task Force were members of NOW and others were not. The committee itself was open only to minority women (although any woman could participate in the activities of the Task Force) because the presence of non-minority women usually precipitated problems with control and decision making that “happened so many times” in other committees with mixed minority and non-minority membership. “Minority women wanted their own identity. They wouldn’t have it with white women telling them what to do,” according to a present member of NOW.

There was considerable argument over the issues of exclusive involvement of minority women in only minority related issues and the exclusive control of all Task Force decisions by minority women. “Perhaps that’s right,” says Corina Aragon. “Maybe minority women need to work on issues relevant to ourselves and our lives so we can develop our own strengths and self-confidence. Then we can extend ourselves to other women-related issues.”

Task Forces report in at Board meetings of NOW and according to Charlotte Hebeler each Task Force “bases its own strategy on its own wisdom but must be willing to change strategy if the Board suggests it. This control was unacceptable to the women in the Minority Women’s Task Force.”

Task Force Leaves NOW

The final decision to leave NOW came after a wine and fondue meeting lasting almost 3 hours. Remaining within the nationally recognized organization included the advantages of retaining the clout that NOW wields, using its resources of lobbying, expertise, and working with and influencing attitudes of non-minority women.

Disadvantages included the continuous problem of insensitivity among many non-minority women, “and we didn’t want to spend our time” in arguments and discussion about why the Task Force wants to do certain things and why minority women feel the way they do. When I called NOW the next day to tell them our decision the woman who answered the phone said that “we are sort of sorry to hear that.”

“Well I was very sorry to have to say that we had voted to leave NOW. I did not vote to do it but I don’t regret the decision to leave. If I were in the white woman’s position,” continues Corina Aragon, “I would have attended the Minority Women’s Task Force meetings, humbled myself, shown concern for minority women’s problems, and tried to work it out.

“It seems that the real problem was a lack of communication, sincere communication from woman to woman. I hope that we can get back to the point where we can really communicate.” Charlotte Hebeler’s feeling was that the Task Force needed “to accomplish what they needed to accomplish on their own...to grow, develop their own wisdom, their own strategy, to make their own mistakes. There was some sort of feeling that even if we do it wrong, at least we do it. But it was a very amicable split... we still communicate...many of us in NOW have had the same kinds of feelings about doing it on our own. It's sad in a way to lose their knowledge and wisdom but in another way it’s kind of neat when somebody says we're going to do it on our own.”

There is currently no Task Force in NOW that deals with the minority woman's problems. The minority women that are presently in NOW seem to be involved in and committed to other things.

Sociologist’s Nightmare

NOW is a “sociologist's nightmare” says Ms. Hebeler. “We are constantly getting new people with varying levels of consciousness to minority problems. Some members are probably racist and will remain so all their lives - but they are not turned off by this Denver chapter because there are so many things to do in the organization. There is concern on the Board to have strong minority participation in NOW...we need to find that minority person to come forward to the Board to do this...we have an informal, personal relationship with our minority members, so it’s not a threatening thing but a growth enhancing thing. Most of us see minority women as women only not as women and members of a minority. We realize that minority women have special, unique problems that require continuing processes of consciousness-raising in this group and we will continue to do it.”

Meanwhile the Minority Women's Task Force is continuing to focus its attention on the Women’s Prison at Canon City. On July 5 they will help to produce a filmed documentary on women prisoners called “The Hidden Minority” to be telecast on Denver Now on channel 2, KWGN-TV. 

Target: Canon City

“Sexism in the Colorado prison system is unbelievable, shocking,” Ms. Aragon reports. Before the Minority Women’s Task Force visited Canon City, federal and state funds provided rehabilitation and pre-parole programs that were exclusively for men. Of course this is a blatant violation of the law, but I suppose that the wardens and...

Petition Alleges Discrimination; Sparks KOA Boycott

Carol Lease

A coalition of women and minorities has filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny KOA its broadcast license renewal because of alleged discrimination against women and minorities. The coalition is instituting a boycott to give their petition a financial bite.

The coalition is comprised of the Colorado Committee on the Mass Media and the Spanish-surnamed, the National Organization for Women (NOW), the Mass Media Task Force and Sundiata, Inc., and the American Indian Movement (AIM).

The controversy centers around the under-utilization of and discrimination towards women and minorities in positions at the station and discriminatory programming concerning women and minorities.

The coalition is asking all people to support their boycott of General Electric products and of companies advertising with GE broadcasting stations KOA-TV, KOA-AM, and KOAQ-FM radio until an acceptable agreement can be reached.

The coalition is also asking people to write letters to the management at KOA encouraging the station to settle the dispute.

KWGN-TV Agreement

The coalition also filed a petition of denial of broadcast license with the FCC against KWGN Television, channel 2. An agreement was reached on May 22 that resulted in the withdrawal of the petition.

Cable TV: Women and the Media

Elissa Meyer

Occasionally I have heard Cable Television referred to as an alter-
native to broadcast television, the hour after hour barrage of
stereotypes and triviality that comes into peoples’ homes through
the airwaves. Cable television is different; it is brought to homes
through wires which carry electronic signals. The range of channels
which can be brought in through the cable is much wider, and it can
provide a much more diverse and realistic selection of program-
ming. Unfortunately, after attending the national convention of the
National Cable Television Association, I feel less than hopeful
about Cable Television’s potential.

I had hoped that the conven-

tion would have one redeeming

factor—that was the Public
Access activity. According to
FCC regulations, when a cable
company receives a franchise to
go into an area, it must provide at
least one Public Access channel
through the cable. When that
channel becomes occupied dur-
ing a specified period of time, the
company is obligated to open
another channel. Under the FCC
guidelines these channels
would make studio time
available to any individual or
group with a TV message at no
cost. Again, the possibilities for
utilizing television as a com-
munications tool under this
system are opened up as never
before. So what is really happen-
ing in these two areas, Cable
Television and Public Access,
especially in terms of changing
attitudes and opportunities for
women?
Profits or People?

On arrival at the Conrad Hilton
in Chicago, the location for the
NCTA Convention, I began to
sense the tone which pervaded
the entire four days: making
Cable a profitable business.
Over three thousand smartly-
suited businessmen were
gathering to shake right hands
and to increase assets. The
overwhelming reality is that it
does take money to lay miles of
cable throughout a geographic
area, and that in order to sell
subscriptions to the cable,
Cablecasters think they must
have slick, pre-packaged
productions to compete with
broadcast. But in this writer's
opinion, they are missing the
point. They ignore the explosive
possibility that if people knew
they could get easy access to TV
time and to the necessary
production tools through Cable,
they would be more likely to sup-
port it. Cablecasters downplay
Public Access because of what
they consider the mediocre
quality of the programming
produced by the newly-
enfranchised public who have
taken advantage of existing
Public Access channels.

As to be expected, this
chauvinistic attitude was ex-
tended to and reflected in the
roles of women at the conven-
tion. There were few women
there who represented top ad-
ministrative positions in Cable;
there were a small minority of
women who were production
managers for Public Access and
local origination programming in
small metropolitan centers. But
the most conspicuous women at
the convention were those not in
positions of responsibility, but
rather those who were dressed
and made-up as models at the
equipment exhibits. In this
multi-million dollar jungle of
sophisticated mixers, switchers,
cameras, and monitors, these
women were planted by the
manufacturers to make their
brands more attractive and
saleable. If this is the mentality
of the Cablecasters, we can ex-
pect little in the way of change in
the programming provided by
them as opposed to present
programming over broadcast
television.
Best Production of the Year
I must admit, the “gentlemen”
did give token recognition to the
work of women in the field of
Cable Television. At the NCTA
Awards Ceremony, Ms. Kim
Beaman and Ms. Nancy Hauser,
the production managers for
Public Access and Local Origina-
tion programming in Jackson,
Michigan, received five top
awards including Best Produc-
tion of the Year for a videotape
called ‘Nancy.’ The tape is a
sensitive, delicate portrayal of a
woman, mother and wife, who is

approaching middle age and
feels trapped by her cir-
cumstances. In a skillful inter-

view style, Ms. Hauser and Ms.
Beaman show Nancy as her
own, individual way of life is
beginning to take shape in her
mind and is starting to unfold in
her interactions with her family
and outside her home in her ac-
tivities. Well deserving of the

acclaim, the tape’s co-producers
accepted the awards, but later
expressed some of their growing
cynicism.

At an ad hoc Women's
Caucus, twenty-five women
attending the convention
gathered to express rising
alienation with Cablecasting. At
this forum, Kim and Nancy
revealed the frustrations of their
work. They work full time for
part-time salaries, making them
the lowest paid employees
among the professional staff.
They also told us that “Nancy”
was one tape of a series shown
weekly which they created and
produced themselves about the
local community. Using portable
videotaping equipment, they
went out into the Jackson area

Filmmaker Claudia Weill shoots a scene from the T.V. special, “Joyce at 34.”

and found people, activities and
programs of local interest. From
these hours of tape they distilled
a format, and after many ad-
ditional hours of editing and

technical work, they had a final

set of polished programs which
truly realized the function of
Cable TV. This series informed
the community about itself; it

was not about celebrities; and it began a real
communications system—not
just from the studio to the home,
but also from the home to the
studio.

None of this valuable work
has been recognized. Even the
award-winning “Nancy” will be
of little benefit to the women
themselves. They told us that
they would get no bonuses
because of the rewards, but that
the Cablecasters would use the
rewards as a sales pitch to get
more subscribers to the Cable.
One woman said she was leav-

ing her position to go back to

school. “I know they will hire a
man in my place, and probably at
twice the salary.” They also
know that any new local origina-
tion programming will de-
emphasize the two-way com-
munication. Cablecasters want
slick, professional looking
products; they are less in-
terested in the real people and
what they have to say.

Among the women’s caucus
were many women from the
Public Access angle of Cable.
Stations; others were just in-
terested in working with video
and using Public Access
channels as a means of distribu-
tion. Nevertheless, we had a
very different and more
frustrating form of sexism to
confront within the meetings
and programs regarding Public
Access.

To begin with, it was apparent
from the start that Public Access
was being downplayed. There
were two rooms set aside in a
far-off corner of the Hilton for
what was called the ‘Video En-
vironment.’ It seemed that all
Public Access information was
to emanate from here, even
though all other aspects of Cable
had space and meetings
throughout the entire hotel.
There were a few sessions held
in other meeting rooms on
Public Access, but these leaned
heavily on the financial feasibili-
ty more than anything else.

The “Video Environment”

from the start was fraught with

problems of its own. Some of
them can be attributed to “lack
of organization,” but in my opi-
nion it suffered from a severe
case of schizophrenia. Most of
the time people were at cross-
purposes to one another. A
number of the people into Public
Access now have come from a
strange breed commonly called
“video-freaks.” They began
recognizing the potential of
video when the portable equip-
ment first came on to the market
about eight years ago. They
started experimenting with the
technology and using it to
promote alternative media. Not
surprisingly, the “video freaks”
were predominantly male, or at

least those who became most

technically advanced were. And
it seems that with their ex-
perience and development they
are moving farther away from
the rationale of alternative
media and closer to the

Channel 6.

traditional concept of pre-
produced programs. At one time
the attitude prevailed that with
the advent of portable, easy-to-
use video equipment, anyone
could be easily trained to use

television as a medium for their
message. Among some alter-

native groups this attitude still
prevails. And these groups con-
tinue to train people—elderly
groups, women's collectives,
high school students, working
people—to use the technology.
They will distribute these tapes
through any means available to
them. That could be Public
Access, broadcast, or simply
closed circuit TV showings with
a specific target audience. But
these groups generate and
proliferate knowledge and skills
about television; they demystify
the technology and promote a
powerful tool for information.

On the other hand, these
groups generally lack resources
and are up against some of the
regressive behavior of other
groups mistakenly taken as
alternatives. These others con-
trolled the ‘Video Environment”
in Chicago. I found them
overwhelmingly male-
dominated, arrogant and op-
pressive. Their primary orienta-
tion was a video product. Within
the small microcosm of the
“Video Environment,” a
hierarchy of status and prestige
emerged parallel if not identical
to the Cable System’s hierarchy.
Highest ranking appeared to be
those people who had managed
to hustle the most money, to put
together the slickest productions
with highly sophisticated
machinery, to talk to the right
man, and to get over Broadcast.
Next were the up-and-comers
who brought hours and hours of
their productions to the conven-
tion on the hope that some
Cablecaster might “discover”
them and offer them money.
Lastly were the struggling
groups trying to make some
sense out of media and with
media for their neighborhoods
and communities.

In and of themselves, produc-
tion and community television
need not be so divergent in
goals. One stresses a process
and the other a product. In one
sense the quality of tapes
created by community people

Letter to Denver

Feminist Guide to Tucson

May 19, 1974  
Hello

all you Denver sisters! I’m from Tucson and am

finishing a long weekend stay in Denver, which has turned out to
be one of the best times I have had in your city. This is the first
time I have been here alone, so I decided to try to contact some
Feminists and check out what’s going on here.

I was a little uneasy about calling up total strangers and

saying, “Hi. My name is Barbara,

I'm from Tucson and I want to

meet some Feminists here.” But after a couple of beers and a
long-distance call to Tucson to gain energy from my sisters

there, I got up enough courage

to make my first call.

First, I called The Women’s Voice and got the number of the
Women in Transition (WIT) House. From there on it was easy!
The sisters at WIT House were warm, friendly and full of
information about what was going on in Denver—complete with
names and telephone numbers. But most of all, they made me
feel like an accepted friend, not a stranger to be tested out.

There has not been enough time on this visit for me to connect
with all the programs, activities, and sisters in Denver that I have

learned about. Fortunately, I am
returning in June and will have
more time to follow through with
my “mission.” Everyone that I

did meet, however, was very interested about what was going on
in Tucson. So it seemed a good idea to try to give you a picture of
the situation in my town and some contacts, in case you are

interested.  
Overview of the Community  
Setting

Tucson is roughly one-third
the size of Denver. We suffer
from over-population, urban
sprawl, and an unfortunate
tendency toward “Californi-
zation.” The community is
surrounded by mountains,
which gives a feeling of
strength and security and
allows an easy “escape” from
the city.

I would describe the general
atmosphere of Tucson to be
friendly, mellow, low-parano-
ia. There seems to be an
attitude of co-existence so
that it is fairly easy to pursue
a different life-style. Contrary
to popular opinion, Tucson is
not a community of mostly
retired people. Young “freaks”
are more visible than the old
folks.

Given the political conser-
vatism of Arizona and the
smaller size of Tucson, it
came as a surprise to me to
realize that Tucson is devel-
oping into something of a
“hot-spot” of Feminist activity
in the Southwest. There is, for
example, a lot more going on
in Tucson than in Phoenix.
Here is a list of some of the
organizations and activities
currently in Tucson.

Tucson Women’s Center - 912 E. Sixth St. 792-1929

Provides a place for wo-
men’s groups for meetings
and social events. Transient
women can crash there for up
to two nights while they get
their feet on the ground and
locate other lodging. Acts as a
resource-information center.

Generally, the center has
two-to-four full-time residents
who help pay the rent. Other
donations are solicited
through individual monthly
pledges from local Feminists.
Persons using the center are
urged to contribute 25 cents
each time.

Alternatives for Women

40 E. 14th Street, #5 884-9776  
A Feminist counseling /

consultation service, this is

where I fit in. In December of

last year, three women—two
psychologists and a social
worker (that’s me) formed a
partnership to create an
alternative mental health ser-
vice for the women of Tucson.

For us, “Alternatives” is a
place where we can utilize our
skills and develop new skills
in a way that is not
exploitative of women who
seek our services. We heartily
reject the traditional “thera-

pist” role since this puts the
“other” in the role

of “patient.”  
The therapist/patient role
model assumes a hierarchi-
cal, one-up / one-down
relationship, focusing on the
“patient's"" weaknesses. It
also makes assumptions a-
bout the strengths and super-
ior skills of the “therapist”
that make us uncomfortable.
So we prefer to act as
consultants and friends to the
women we work with and
focus on their strengths.

Right now we are doing
mostly individual work, with
some groups going and others
planned. Ann has a con-
sciousness-raising group go-
ing, and will be starting
another soon. I have a
Bodywork for Women group
on Wednesday nights that
includes yoga, massage and
belly dancing. It’s an open
group, so that a woman can
drop by any Wednesday she
feels inclined; she doesn't
have to sign up for a series.
Dorothy is working on a
Lesbian Identity group.

We are a low-profit organi-
zation. The client sets her own
fee based on her own assess-
ment of what she can afford.
We explain that we need an
average of $8 per visit and that
every dollar above that helps
for those who must pay less.
It works! Most weeks we
average close to $8 per visit.
But we would like to find
sources of support so that we
aren’t totally dependent on
fees.

Center 415 N. 4th Ave.
792-3715

Located in the loft of
Antigone Books, this is a
brand new organization form-
ed by one of the women of
“Alternatives for Women,” a-
long with two others. “Alter-
natives” refers all those
seeking astrological consul-
tation to Minerva, since in

Scott 622-8821

A part of the Tucson Free
Clinic, the Women's Clinic is
open on Monday nights to
offer free gynecological care.
The clinic is staffed by
volunteer Feminist-oriented
patient advocates and nurses,
with a local gynecologist
standing by for consultation.
Instruction in gynecological

self-help (do your own pelvic

exam, etc.) is offered but not
pushed on women attending
the clinic. The atmosphere is
warm and relaxed. Contact:

Fifth Avenue House - 847 S.
Fifth Ave. 792-1890

This is a collective formed
by five beautiful women.
Although a private home, it is

a core of feminist activity in
Tucson. It is through Fifth
Ave. that we have established
and maintained ties with
women’s collectives and
Feminist activities in Arkan-
sas, New Mexico, Oregon and
Washington. Contact: Ann,
Colleen, Debbie, Leslie or
Tina.

Men’s Consciousness Raising
Group

Formed by several gay and
straight men, we consider this
group to be an important
adjunct to the Feminist
movement in Tucson. These
are men who are committed to
raising their own conscious-
ness and breaking down
sex-role stereotypes. We love
them dearly and collaborate
with them frequently. “Alter-
natives for Women” is cur-
rently exploring ways to work
together, such as in providing
some mixed women/men
workshops for those who
want to work on inter-sex
relationships. Contact Jack
Lathan 623-0994 or Perk Clark
623-1072.

This pretty much exhausts
my supply of information (and
me). I'll probably learn what I
left out when I get home. I
hope this letter doesn’t come
on like an underground
Chamber of Commerce report.
If it does, it's because I really
love the place and most of the
people.

Please feel free to contact
any of the places or people I
have mentioned—by phone,
letter, or in person. We'd love
to meet you!

We hope to see many of you
at the Summer Solstice in
New Mexico this June. In case
you don’t know about this BIG
EVENT, it’s a gathering of

women from all over the west.

There will be booths, arts and
crafts, displays, workshops,
and all manner of goings on.
All the Feminist businesses in
Tucson will be closing down
and forming a large caravan.
See you there.

Sisterhood is not only
powerful—it’s fun.

CLUW Begins  
Unifying Union Women  

The first statewide confer-  
ence of Coalition of Labor  
Union Women (CLUW) was  
held in Denver on June 8th at  
the Albany Hotel.  

The CLUW is a new,  
national organization formed  
to fight for the needs of  
working women through un-  
ion structures. It was founded  
in Chicago on March 23-24th.  

“The primary purpose of  
this new coalition is to unify  
all union women in a viable  
organization, first -- to deter-  
mine our common problems  
and concerns, and second --  
to develop action programs  
within the framework of our  
unions to deal effectively with  
our objectives.  

We recognize that our  
struggle goes beyond the  
borders of this nation and  
seek to link up with our  
working sisters and brothers  
throughout the world through  
concrete action of interna-  
tional workers’ solidarity.  

Through unity of purpose,  
the Coalition of Labor Union  
Women will seek to accom-  
plish these goals.” CLUW  
Statement of Purpose  

Colorado's first CLUW  
conference got off to a  
spirited start with Debbie  
Singer playing guitar and  
everyone singing “Union  
Maid.” There was an intro-  
ductory speech by Chairwo-  
man Joyce Newell, followed  
by a talk by Dr. Jeanne  
Stellman of the Oil, Chemical  
and Atomic Workers Union on  

Well, hi! You must be the new  
girl for the typing pool, I’m  
your supervisor, Mr. Swiney. BN  
And you're...? { .  

“Women and Health and  
Safety.” Dr. Stellman is the  
author of the book Work is  

Dangerous to Your Health.  

She said that most research  
on health hazards is done  
primarily for men, and that the  
only time they think about  
women is during pregnancy.  
“And obviously what's harm-  
ful to you when you're  
pregnant is harmful to your  
health even when you're not.”  
Stellman was followed by  
Leslie Nader of the Amalga-  
mated Clothing Workers Un-  
ion on “Childcare.” Ms.  
Nader talked about a union-  
sponsored day care center  
which Amalgamated Clothing  
Workers of America have  
started in Chicago, and which  
is completely free to the  
employee. It is quality day  
care that provides an enrich-  
ing, stimulating experience  
for children, and not merely  
custodial care. She said that  
eight percent of Amalgamated  
members are women and that  
childcare is not a women’s  
problem, it is a problem that  
should concern all people  
interested in the future.  
“Even Our Union Brothers”  
Irene Chandler, United  
Farmworkers Union, spoke on  
“Organizing, Strikes and Boy-  
cotts.” She said a big problem  
is that men don’t take women  
seriously and this even  
applies to our union brothers.  
“We must learn to stick  
together and let them know

Dear Big Mama Rag,  

My apologies for not writing  
sooner. I was really elated way  
back in January, February  
(when?) when I found your (or my)  
newspaper at the Woman’s Voice.  
It was the second issue I think,  
but I really enjoyed it. Thank you  
for the list of places where it can  
be found. I think you really cover  
a lot of ground and have a good  
variety. Do you still do a little on  
Women's History? I was really  
surprised to learn that women  
have done so much in the past,  
but the only areas that I can find  
out about are sports and  
medicine. What about law,  
politics, art, religion, etc? Do you  
have any good suggestions on  
reading? I just want you to know  
that women in Denver are

Ed: This issue is the ninth issue  
of BMR to date. Last year we had  
several articles on women's  
history, and would like very much  
to have more, but we have had no  
manuscripts submitted. Anyone  
interested? The BMR staff re-  
cently has been reading Mothers  
and Amazons and The First Sex.  

HAWK BIG MAMA!  

My charge for condescending  
remarks is 15%.  

Dear Big Mama Rag Staff:  

We have read our copy of Big  
Mama Rag with interest and  
admiration for your professional-  
ism. We are entering an exchange  
subscription; you will receive  
your first issue late next month.  

We were the first statewide  
Feminist publication in the  
United States, according to  
research at the Women’s History  
Archive. Our first issue came out  
in January 1972. We are aware of  
only three others: New Direc-  
tions for Women in Delaware, The  
Texan Woman (I have not heard  
from them lately), and Big Mama  
Rag.  

To the Staff--and particularly to  
Linda:  

I enjoyed the copy of the paper  
you just sent me. It is very well  
done, and very important, I  
believe, to the women’s move-  
ment in this area. Essential at  
this time, in fact.  

Linda, I liked the article you  
did, based on your interview with  
me. It was well written, honest,  
and genuinely reflective of our  
talk, I think. Thanks.  

Sincerely,  

Charlotte Wolf

I'm here to fix your Xerox 300.  

Good luck in your pioneering.  
We look forward to your future  
issues,

Editorial  
Just Reduction of People?  

The Talmadge Amendment has demonstrated that its goal is  
the reduction of the number of people on welfare - nothing else.  
Concern for the human condition of people who need assistance  
to survive in this country is probably written somewhere in a  
memo connected with this law but has never been a part of it.  
The distorted, prejudiced stereotypes that make receiving welfare  
a stigma in this society have been strengthened again and again  
through the work ethic. Expending physical or mental energy -  
does not make a person well-off, rich, or even maintain a  
sustenance level of life. Work has nothing to do with wealth. The  
survival of this economy necessitates the existence of a welfare  
class.  

It is the unskilled woman, minority and non-minority, who is  
forced to prostitute herself in a meaningless, dead-end, slave  
wage job for the Department of Welfare that is unaware of and  
unresponsive to her needs. Even within these “improvement”  
programs men receive priority in training over women although  
women are the vast majority of welfare recipients. But now it is  
the women on welfare who are uniting and supporting each other  
in their struggle. We support Chicana Welfare Rights nationally  
and locally in their efforts to repeal the Talmadge Amendment to  
the Social Security Act.  

One Reader’s Opinion  

Carol Hansford  

A “straight” woman is a woman without any feminist  
consciousness. A straight woman is not merely a woman who  
sleeps only with men. Defining a woman as “straight,” if she is  
not homosexual, creates resentment which ultimately can lead  
to alienation from other women.  

Some lesbians feel that all women are lesbians whether they  
know or will admit it. All women are not lesbians just as all  
women are not heterosexuals. It is lesbian chauvinism to think  
otherwise. Commitment to other women does exist - strong and  
honest without sexual involvement. It comes from a true, deep  
feeling of women as sisters; it is not dependent on sexual  
encounters.  

There seems to be a feeling of “more Feminist than thou” by  
some lesbians in the movement whose actions and attitudes say,  
“If I sleep with a woman, I am more radical, heavy, together than  
a woman who sleeps alone, with men or with women and men.”  

An aspect of feminism is that a woman must control her own  
body - all aspects of her body - in the area of sexual activity as  
well as motherhood. Feminism also demands the making of a  
woman's culture through the creation of viable alternatives and  
the denial of any oppression among people: honesty.  

Some Feminists recognize lesbianism as a viable alternative,  
although sections of the lesbian movement don't recognize  
heterosexuality as a viable alternative. Heterosexuality is not  
exclusively culturally determined. All women have the option of  
accepting or rejecting it. It is a choice that Feminists make.  
Straight women don’t make that choice. They are locked into  
societal expectations of their sexual behavior, but Feminists  
have stepped away from this and are not bound by such stringent  
social roles.  

As long as sexual preference is allowed to create a difference  
among Feminists the divisiveness rampant in this women’s  
movement will remain and be a detriment to real change. Women  
should unite around their politics not their sexual proclivities.  
Let's put our energy into fighting sexism - our common enemy."

Poetry

Our woman-heritage is one of love and power and courage and
beauty. Woman, life-giver, earth-molder, passer-down through
centuries of daughter birth the strength of humanness, corrupted
by man’s myth of evil, sapped by the man-child’s parasite’s
sucking bite, trampled with his rush to die.

In 1945, a huge and gleaming structure, built to soar and dip
and dive and top the clouds in the wake of dreams’ exhaust, was
named for two women, was made pregnant with a device more
horrible than womankind’s worst fears, was made to carry this
device to a small and remote place called Hiroshima, and in a
swift delivery, bore death and destruction. The following poem,
our life-course. It meant to cry for all women, to anger, to stir,
and to unite.

ENOLA Gay
Enola Gay
was a lady,
they say
a sleek, slender
lady
of sensuous way, to feel the void in ourselves
a dark, daring the crush of emptiness.

without any they cannot afford to let you live,

hubbub, confusion, — so calm this can mean
their eyes devour cities.

She bought
all the dreams
and went on her way,

their tongues drip honeydew
upon the wounds of the poor.

the shapes of sleep are all around us.

A sensible lady ~-Janet McReynolds
as Enola Gay
doesn't buy dreams
to fill up the day.
So they took her
and wrapped her
in concrete and gauze,
so nicely removing
the proximal cause,
and the dreams, hopes,
and plans
of Enola Gay
were washed down
the drainpipe
and mixed with red clay.
When they had done
on that horrible day
they put on
a death mask
and hauled her away.
Such is the story
of Enola Gay,
a wonderfully womanly
lady,
they say.

WOMAN ALIVE!  
Women Recorded

Elissa Meyer

WOMAN ALIVE! above all  
else celebrates the diversity of  
women. The program does not  
pass judgment, nor offer an  
evaluation of lifestyles or  
struggles. Each segment of-  
fers insight into the unique  
circumstances of each wo-  
man's life. The camera probes  
into the interpersonal difficul-  
ties of Pat and Charles  
Sackrey who are “working  
hard on being together.” And  
it records the concerns of  
Iowan women encountering  
disrespect and discrimination  
on their jobs. The stereotype of  
“women’s movement - as -  
white - middle - class” is  
beautifully denounced as  
black women of the National  
Black Feminist Organization  
discuss the peculiarities of  
their dual oppression, and  
finally as Crystal Lee’s story  
of union organizing unfolds  
for us. Crystal Lee Jordan of  
Roanoke Rapids, North Caro-  
lina does not talk with her  

Pat Sackrey talks with  
Charles. She goes each day to  
picket lines and union rallies,  
whereas Pat works long hours  
at the Everywoman’s Center in  
Massachusetts.

And like the women’s  
movement itself, the program  
sets off a melody singing  
inside you; the refrain echoes  
in your mind and you want to  
hear more. I felt like I wanted  
to put every woman in front of  
a camera to tell her story, to  
elaborate on her struggles.  
Because I share the profound  
belief that in respecting, and  
indeed celebrating, the u-  
niqueness and strength of a  
woman’s character, regard-  
less of her particular situa-  
tion, women will break the  
bondage of stereotype, self-  
denigration and roles for  
good. As Milissa Manchester  
sings at the end of the  
program, “Oh heaven how  
you’ve changed for me now...  
the miracle is in my soul....”

Comment

It was remarkably appro-  
priate to have Maya Angelou  
follow WOMAN ALIVE! Maya  
says of Aesuit “I, a woman;  
I, a black; I, a human.” It is  
society which attaches labels  
and stereotypes to these facts  
because then society need not  
deal with the human element  
in all of us. She goes on to  
comment on the validity of  
struggles for liberation. Even  
though she differentiates be-  
tween white women’s issues  
and black women’s issues she  
conveys a respect, more than  
that, a necessity, for each  
group to deal with its own  
oppression. Similarly, as to  
race relations, Ms. Angelou  
regards Watergate as the most  
important matter for white  
folks because it affords us the  
opportunity to confront our  
own morality and integrity, to  
clean up our own backyard.

last three years trying to save
4 million dollars of welfare
grants reflects the inadequacy
and incompetency of such a
program. However, Congress
still chose to fund it again.
WIN program became the
vehicle to implement the
Talmadge Amendment.

In November of 1971, Nixon
vetoed a child care bill which
proposed free child care
centers to families earning

less than $4,000.00 a year. 

These child care centers
would have been communi-
ty-administered, yet his rejec-
tion was based on the
reasoning that child care
centers were a threat to the
most fundamental institution
in this country - the family!

The child care centers,
Nixon reasoned, would offer
more opportunity for women
to leave the family and go to
work. It is ironic that a year
later, the poor welfare Chica-
na is mandated (by the
Talmadge Amendment) to
leave her home to look for
so-called “employment” or
“training” and to leave her
children at child care centers.
Where was Nixon’s veto this
time around?

Mothers Cannot Choose

It should be emphasized
that the welfare mother is
mandated to leave her child-
ren at a child care center if
there is one available. If she
rejects the child care center
because of its location, its

facilities, its program, or its
personnel, she will be “dere-
gistered”--rendered ineligible
for welfare. Thus, if the center
is not bilingual, bicultural and
totally negates the family life
style as well as usurping the
authority of the parent, the
Chicana on welfare has no
right to accept or reject
programs concerning the wel-
fare and education of her
children. Presently, the num-
ber and the quality of available
child care centers is insuffi-
cient to meet the working
mothers’ needs, especially the
poor working mother.

If the Chicana is forced to
put her children into educa-
tional centers which have
traditionally failed her people,
her children may become
drop-outs at a much earlier
age. The child’s life can be
surrounded by not only racist,
monolingual, monocultural
institutions, but the child can
also come to contend with the
stigma and harassment en-
countered from the educa-
tional institutions towards
people on welfare. Unfortu-
nately, the taxpayer accuses
the child as the source of his
financial burden. Welfare
mothers want to prevent this
victimization of their children.

Amendment

—Jay Schatz
CWRL Challenges Welfare

The Chicana Welfare Rights
organization challenges the
Talmadge Amendment to real-
ly deal with the problems of
welfare. In doing so, it hopes
to work for a program which
will provide good training and
valuable jobs. In addition, it is
striving to have the work and

the rights of poor women

recognized.

In general, minimum wage
laws are applicable to all
industries and occupations
except domestic service and
farm workers. The Talmadge
Amendment creates a new ca-
tegory of workers who are also
exempt from the minimum
wage law - the welfare recipi-
ent worker. In order to ensure
that people really get off, or
stay off welfare, the standard
minimum wage should in-
clude all working people. In
addition, a welfare recipient
should receive the same
salary as other workers doing
the same job.

Chicana Welfare Rights
requires all training programs
to include a community labor
council to help identify the
needs of the labor market in
order to prevent wasting time
in being trained for obsolete
jobs with no future. Jobs
should be open for individual
advancement in that field. The
quality of training should be
sufficient and adequate rather
than provide instant short-
lived panaceas.

Traditionally, civil service
jobs have used tests as a
selection process in hiring.
These tests do not necessarily
reflect the kind of jobs applied
for. Chicana Welfare Rights
recommends that training
include preparation for civil
service jobs. It feels civil
service test requirements
should be withdrawn, or
substituted through partici-
pation in the training pro-
gram.

In the case of college
scholarships or other valuable
training, equal recruitment
should exist for both men and
women. According to the
Talmadge Amendment,
unemployed fathers and youths
sixteen years and older were
identified as priority targets in
the WIN training program.
CWR believes that this atti-
tude ignores the fact that the
majority of adults on welfare
are women as heads of
household. These women
should have equal opportunity
in training and for employ-
ment.

A widow of 56 years, having
raised five children who are
now over the age of 18 years,
cannot receive social security
benefits. Her children are too
old for aid to dependent
children, and she is too young
for the old age plan (for people
62 years and over). As far as
her employability is con-
cerned, there is little demand
for a woman her age in the
labor market. Her employable
status is greatly reduced
because housework and
motherhood are not counted
as work experience.

Three Point Program

CWR has identified a three
point program insuring the

can be improved; in another
sense people making produc-
tions for profit can share some of
their resources to help
proliferate skills and access. A
balance can be reached if people
shared similar attitudes regard-
ing the need for true alter-
natives. Unfortunately, the taste
for money and technical
chauvinism have pushed some
of the public access people
beyond caring whether they
create alternatives or not. Just
as creating a profitable business
out of cable television has
become the only concern of
companies rather than offering
relevant programming as an
alternative to broadcast and
rather than promoting use of the
media by the public to create
their own TV.

Gladly enough Community
Television is gaining strength. In
places around the country at-
titudes are changing and oppor-
tunities for women look more
promising. At Input in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the staff
includes skilled and dynamic
women. They stress training
rather than production and
maintain a library of community
produced tapes. In another part
of the country, a group of women
have leased an entire channel of
cable and are producing video
exclusively for, about and with
women. Minority women are ac-
tive producers of “survival”

rights of poor women on
welfare. First, recognition of
woman's work in the home as
a mother and as a housekeep-
er must be provided through
Social Security benefits. Se-
cond, women on welfare
should be given the right to
choose whether to work in the
home, or out of the home.
Third, free, 16-hour commun-
ity controlled child-care cen-
ters must be provided for
families earning less than
$4,000.00 a year.

It is an injustice when the
Equal Rights Amendment,
which demands equal pay for
equal work, does not extend
to the mother whose work is
not considered part of the
labor force. Society forgets
that she is responsible for the
maintenance of the labor
force. The ERA is a victory
only for the “recognized and
organized” employed. The
“unrecognized” worker - the
mother - has still to fight for
her equal rights in order to
secure payment for her job,
and to secure social security
benefits for her service.

The middle class commun-
ity as well as the low-income
community must be educated.
They must be made aware of
the fact that the welfare
recipients are not the only
victims of the educational and
economic system. The great-
est criminals - who hurt the
taxpayer are the corporations
which can legally avoid paying
taxes and the landowners
such as Talmadge of Georgia,
who are subsidized not to use
their land. It is not the people
struggling for food, shelter
and a decent job.

Nurture

Barbara Hume

Cross-cultural studies indicate that, almost universally, mother and child are close together the first few days after delivery. The father may or may not be included in this togetherness. The degree to which the father is involved usually reflects his later role in child-rearing. Some people suggest that it is the early contact of father and child which triggers his increased participation in parenting. The system of separation of mother and child, at its extreme in high risk and premature nurseries, is unique to our society.

While studies on other animals clearly show a critical period during which separation of mother and child leads to severe problems or rejection of the child, there has been a reluctance to extend these ideas to the human animal. Now, however, evidence indicates that human beings have their own species-specific routine pattern of behavior which crosses cultural lines. Filmed observations show a routine pattern beginning with fingertip touching of the infant's extremities and proceeding to massaging and palm contact with the trunk. Mothers of premature infants follow a similar sequence if allowed to touch their infants, though at a slower rate. At least some researchers feel that eye-to-eye contact is also crucial as one innate releaser of maternal caretaking patterns. Yet other studies indicate that mothers separated for 20 days have more trouble bottle feeding than mothers who have early contact with their infants. Cuddling was diminished for these late contact mothers as was eye-to-eye contact. This is very important for the child’s subsequent development since it has been shown that “...early maternal attentiveness facilitates later exploratory behavior in infants.” (Klaus and Kennell, p. 1025)

“Observations in human mothers suggest that affectional bonds are forming before delivery, but that they are fragile and may be easily altered in the first days of life. A preliminary inspection of fragments of available data suggests that maternal behavior may be altered in some women by a period of separation, just as infant behavior is affected by isolation from the mother.” (Klaus and Kennell p. 1035)

The newborn nursery is a medical fad which became the norm despite limited evidence in its favor. Before we risk a similar mistake with respect to rooming-in, more evidence should be gathered and alternatives explored. Home delivery and maternity hospitals are successful in many countries. A local alternative is the newborn nursery at Colorado General Hospital where parents enter and leave the nursery freely at any time of day or night. Conversely, babies go out to the mother’s room any time, for any length of time. It has been found that adequate handwashing and isolation of diseased mothers and babies is all that is required to provide a safe place for mother and child.

If you are about to deliver a child, consider (1) what you feel your needs are, (2) what facilities are offered in your community, and (3) insist on using the most suitable of these facilities to its maximum. If you plan to breastfeed, a hospital which forbids breastfeeding the first 12 hours, and then brings the child every four hours only, certainly isn’t going to help you develop a good milk supply.

Minority Task Force continued from page 4

other state corrections officers consider their decisions part of natural law.

The men’s prison has a pre-parole program that allows prisoners to live in special housing thirty days before their release. The men have a period of readjustment into community life, attend orientation groups, get their driver's license, and use real money instead of the wooden tokens of the prison.

Now, because of publicity from the Task Force, women prisoners can attend lectures. They cannot get a driver's license, use money, and of course they cannot live (read sleep) in the pre-parole facility. Certain petty rules apply only to women prisoners such as no talking in the T.V. room, no leaving until a show is over, no exchange of food in the dining room, no talking from table to table while eating.

“Say Something Nice”

After the first visit of the Task Force the women prisoners were told by their female warden to “say something nice” about their home away from home. A few rules have been changed since then. Women can now dye their hair, can choose their own seats for meals, and now women can leave the prison in pants suits. The former rule was that no woman could go outside of the prison walls in anything but a dress. Now all women must wear pants, not dresses.

Two women were punished for hugging each other when one heard of her release. Women are subjected to dehumanizing medical exams whenever they return to the facility from the outside. There is no male-female socialization because of the fear that the women might get pregnant.

Women still do not have a work-release program that men have which allows the prisoner to live and work in a city outside of prison. Women prisoners must remain in their prison and do the laundry and sewing for the prison.

KOA Boycott

From Page 3

This agreement will provide for the creation of a women’s and minority advisory council to help locate qualified and qualifiable women and minority employees and to recommend programming for the station in women's and minority affairs. KWGN also agreed to a 10 percent reduction of commercials during children’s programs, and to hire a woman or minority person as an affirmative action director and another as a minority affairs director.

Negotiations with KOA have been handled through the president and vice-president of GE Broadcasting from New York, “because we had communications problems with KOA management,” according to Virginia Woodard, chairwoman of the Media Monitoring Task Force of NOW. “GE is having similar problems all over the country. The owners haven’t been too prudent in their negotiations with the coalition. This would have been a brushfire - easy to put out - but now...”

KOA Talks Breakdown

“The biggest problem has been and is now a breakdown in communication,” continues Ms. Woodard. “The coalition presented an agreement to the station. KOA objected to some things in the agreement, the coalition agreed to change these things and the station then sent back a completely new agreement - things were in it that we had never even discussed before. Can you believe that KOA wanted to pack the proposed Advisory Council with station selected people, effectively making it a rubber stamp for the station instead of giving women and minorities the voice we demand?”

The coalition is willing to participate in further negotiations with the station but has meanwhile ordered bumper stickers. Money seems to be the ultimate negotiator.

On June 20 the vice-president and general manager, the operations manager, and the production manager, all of KOA-TV and all male and non-minority members, were fired from KOA. The coalition has had difficulty working with these station employees due to their alleged racist and sexist attitudes, according to a member of the coalition.

The new general manager seems to be “more reasonable and rational in his thinking and more aware of community needs,” says Ms. Woodard. The coalition is now waiting for negotiations to reopen with the management hopefully to create a working agreement between the two groups."

EnerGizing the Feminine Principle Today

Linda Fowler

Women form the oldest and largest continually oppressed
group in the family of humankind, their subjugation dating from
the downfall of communal society and the rise of private
property. The oppression of women exists today at all levels of
social, economic, political, and psychological interaction.

At the social and personal
levels, women’s oppression is
manifested through a lack of
personal identity. Women are
recognized, not as individu-
als, but through their men,
i.e., fathers, husbands, or
family. Through discouraged
relationships with other wo-
men, particularly in groups,
women have grown up with
the idea that they did things
with women socially, only
when they could not have the
company of a man. Through
the frequent threat or actuality
of open hostility and physical
aggression, women are kept
“in line.” In the case of
Lesbians, who are sometimes
physically assaulted, this is
primarily because they do not
relate to men physically or
emotionally, and are not
dependent on them either
economically or psychologi-
cally—are not the property of a
man or men. In the case of
women, wife-beating is not at all uncom-
mon. When Women’s Aid (a

society to aid women who
suffer physical abuse from
their men) opened its doors in
England, fifty-four women
and their children appealed for
help the first day of operation.

“The origin of caste (and the
beginning of class) was the
subjugation of the female sex.
The struggle against the basis
of oppression is at a higher
stage of revolution than the
archaic strategy of the present
radical analysis. In a time
when nearly every American
male is economically capable
of possessing a household
slave or a pretty toy, we
consider women to be the
proletariat.” 1

Economically, women are
now and always have been the
most exploited members of
any working class. Women
receive lower pay for equal
work. In fact, U.S. Govern-
ment statistics show that
white women earn less pro-
portionately than black men
(one example of caste within
the system of class). The
housewife, working endless
hours in the home (99 hours
per week, according to a
Chase Manhattan Bank esti-
mate), is the chief source of
unpaid labor in this or any
country in the world. Without
her slave labor, the entire
economic system could col-
lapse. “The rationalization is
usually that women are
inherently altruistic, which
makes about as much sense
as Senator George Murphy’s
remark that Mexicans are
better suited to stoop labor
because they are ‘built low to
the ground.’ ” 2

All men, whether intention-
ally or unintentionally, have
benefited from the social
position of women, just as all
whites have benefited from
the social position of blacks.

Engels saw the middle-
class man’s woman as a
domestic slave, not a middle-
class person. He wrote: “The
first oppression that occurs in
history coincides with the
development of the antagon-
ism between man and woman
in monogamous marriage,
and the first class oppression
coincides with that of the
female sex by the male.” It is
no accident, Engels said, that
the enslavement of the woman
coincides with the rise of
private property; in fact,
woman (her labor and her
product) was (and still is,
psychologically) the most
valuable property that a man
could possess.

Political oppression until
recently has been total. The
right to vote was not granted
until 1920, many years after
the black man had received
this privilege. This fact is
testimony that all women,
regardless of the social
position of their husbands or
families, are members of a
caste which is considered
lower than that of any man,
whether he be black, white,
upper, middle, or lower class.
Even today women hold less
than 1% of elected offices in
the United States.

WOMEN’S IDENTITY

Although certain social and
legal adjustments can be
documented, mass consci-
ousness itself has not
changed accordingly. The
most severe oppression, and
the crux of all others, has
been and continues to be
psychological. Women suffer
extreme identity confusion,
lack confidence in their
abilities, have little sense of
self-worth, and experience
alienation from other women
and from their own feminine
principle.

They are apart from someone
else. Just as blacks live in a
world defined by whites,
women live in a world defined
by males. (The generic term
for human being is “man”;
“woman” means “wife of
man.”) Thus identified and
defined, a woman has little if
any sense of herself as an
individual entity. (We do not
suggest that there are no
women who have escaped this
situation; certainly, all of us
could cite a few obvious
exceptions. But the excep-
tional woman is not the
problem. The problem is the
situation of the vast majority
of women today.)

With little confidence and
almost no sense of self-worth
(impossible without a sense
of “self”) or the worth of other
women, she looks up to and
identifies with men, particu-
larly those to whom she is in
the closest proximity, i.e.,
those of her political lean-
ings, social position, or race.
For example, the black poet-
ess, Nikki Giovanni, was
quoted by the Denver Post
(Feb. 28, 1973), “The first
thing we must do as black
people, as black women, is
get power for black men.” And
Kathleen Cleaver in a San
Francisco Chronicle interview
stated she wanted nothing
more than a private life as
mother and housewife; that
she was only fighting to help
her man out, so he could be a
good father and breadwinner.

This socially conditioned
sense of altruism, coupled
with derogatory attitudes to-
wards women, and especially
towards Feminism, produces
in women a dislike of other
women, and thereby a hatred
of themselves.

THE FEMININE PRINCIPLE
As long as this abject image
of Woman remains intact,
women will have no incentive
to attempt a rediscovery of the
feminine principle. This re-
discovery of and reintegration
with the feminine principle is
the crucial point for both the
society and the individual.
The feminine principle of
life, nurturance, balance, and
harmony is the principle of the
earth itself. And it is this
principle which is being des-
troyed in the individual, in our
interpersonal relationships,
and in the earth which has
given us birth and continues
to give us life. The life-giving
energy manifest in the form of
woman, in the feminine
principle, is being destroyed
through the male principle of
power.

“It is no accident that the
second wave of feminism has
coincided with the interest in
the earth’s ecology. Our
ecology is in an almost
unbelievably perilous state.
Balance has been upset to the
point where all our lives are
threatened. The earth, the
eternally feminine, has been
brutally raped. Man’s desire to
“master” nature has become a
mastery of death-force.

This feminine principle—
that which is maternal,
materialist and peaceful (non-
competitive)—must, for the
survival of us all, be reassert-
ed at all levels of interaction.
It is woman, the biological
female, who can reaffirm this
principle through her own
self-knowledge.

THE POLITICS OF GROWTH

Woman in her present
condition does not know who
she is, through either her
history (almost totally de-
stroyed) or her identity, and
hence, cannot begin to
reaffirm what she is (the
feminine principle). The right
of every entity, indeed the
necessity, is to know who and
what we are. Without this
knowledge, no growth is
possible.

Men and women have
reached a point of combative
interaction at which all move-
ment stops. And with it all
growth. And with that, all life.

Both men and women must
assume responsibilities for
eliminating that combative
interaction—for seeing what
is happening at all levels of
interaction.

Presently, every sphere of
government and influence is
controlled by men. Personal
solutions or exceptional ad-
justments to political problems
are not revolution. The solu-
tion is found in uniting with
other women to assert the
integrity of us all. Conscious-
ness-raising is more than the
awareness of one’s condition;
it is the ability to move.

When a woman is just
beginning to establish her
own identity, to explore
herself as a full person in her
own right, rather than as an
appendage of some “other,”
she is on very shaky ground
personally—unsure of any-
thing. Previous to this point,
she has had some identity
(through men, family), if not
her own. Now, with nothing to
rely on, she is more easily
than ever intimidated.

Passivity has been woman’s
accommodation to oppres-
sion on all levels. Through
years of social conditioning to
be passive, it is now impossi-
ble for her to assert her
identity in association with
the male. She is so condi-
tioned to non-assertiveness in
association with men that she
cannot possibly get it
together to assert something
of which she herself is
unsure.

It makes no difference at
this point what the particular
attitudes of men may be,
either positive and encourag-
ing or negative and discour-
aging. She is so well-condi-
tioned and so insecure that
she cannot function in their
presence.

She does not know her
identity and needs her sisters'
parity and support to discover
it. Working together on
projects and in discussion
groups, women start to see
each other not as competitors
or inferior companions, but as
sisters in a common struggle.
Identity with other women on
all levels is the ideal for the
Feminist seeking equality,
self-realization, and reinte-
gration with her feminine
principle. She attains an
increasing sense of self-worth
in an atmosphere of real
equality in which no party has
the social advantage. This
atmosphere is created in
centers and groupings which
are specifically women’s. We
need places to encounter
ourselves and each other and
places to affirm our culture.

The feminine principle must
be reaffirmed by us all. It is
woman who is in touch with
this principle. She must have
a conscious awareness of
this, a firmly established
sense of personal being and
personal worth, a sense of her
own entity—she must know
who she is—before she can
meaningfully contribute to an
evolving society; before she
can effect social change. The
“feminist’s withdrawal as far as
possible from the source of
her oppression can in no way
be construed as a political
cop-out. On the contrary, it is
at this point that the conflu-
ence of the personal/political
(articulated but not sufficient-
ly explored by feminists as a
whole) attains the dimension
of imperative reality, . . .” 3

Feminine Principle  
continued from page 13

down from above. We must  
fight our own battles without  

paternalistic assistance. We  

must fight our own oppres-  
sion with our own force. This  
requires a sense of our own  
identity. Because we have  
traditionally been identified  
through men and families  
rather than through ourselves,  
we now need a certain degree  
of withdrawal into ourselves. In  
order to realize a deeply  
personal identity. This means  
women functioning together  
with women in order to know  
the essence of Woman. Only  
as women come to know  
themselves will they be able  
to function successfully in  
coalition with men. “Once  
women have shared the  
process of self-discovery and  
the experience of independent  
decision-making, they are  
ready for the great struggle...  
This is not a struggle against  
men... Women cannot be  
free until men are free... . The  
solutions for women lie in  
solving far-ranging social  
problems. But this involves  
nothing short of revolutionary  
restructuring of the most  
basic institutions in society.”  

RADICAL FEMINISM

As the radical Feminist  
sees it... “The Feminist  
movement generally is still  
basically a ‘reform’ movement  
directed toward bigger and  
better participation in the  
male privilege through equali-  
ty in his system and thus a  
further denial of her own  
identity in the wages of power  
in the same sexual caste  
system which she claims to  
be the source of her depriva-  
tion.” Until sexual oppres-  
sion is eliminated, oppression  
itself will continue regardless  
of any social, political, or  
economic adjustments. Radi-  
cal Feminists do not want  
equal privileges in the existing  
society, do not want equality  
with what maleness is -- with  
aggression, destruction, and  
death. We want to restructure  
society, changing its existing  
definitions of masculine and  
feminine. We see that we  
must begin creating the new  
person within ourselves. We  
want men and women to reject  
their programmed roles and  
question every single aspect  
of this society, their role in it  
and their behavior.

Male supremacy is not a  
personal problem, but a  
pervasive social force. We will  
begin to solve the problem  
when women organize and  
back each other up. That is  
the immediate goal of Femin-  
ism -- to get women together,  
to make them see each other  
as sisters and allies instead of  
competitors for male favors.  
As yet we have no clear vision  
of the new society. That will  
develop with time. But we do  
know that sexism, like racism,  
is incompatible with human  
dignity.

Chicana Welfare Rights

From Page 1

the separation of children
from their families “especially
in the Chicano community.
They are reacting to their own
incompetence and using the
Chicana mother as their
scapegoat,” she continues.
Since the Chicana Welfare
Rights has been using space
temporarily in the Legal Aid
office at 820 Santa Fe, 55
cases have come to the
welfare rights group from
parents who want to institute
legal proceedings to have
their court-separated children
returned to their custody.
Chicano Culture Ignored
Patricia Estrada says that

much which has been written
about the child abuser is
misused, misinterpreted and
misdirected to the Chicana
mother. “No research has ever
been done on Chicano culture
in the areas of child abuse.
Black and Anglo women who
were known abusers were the
groups studied that furnished
profiles for Dr. Henry Kemp’s
book The Battered Child
Syndrome that is used by
hospitals to recognize a child
abuser.

“In the Chicano culture it is
normal for the young Chicana
to help raise her mother's
family. But this past experi-
ence of a Chicana mother who
takes her child to the hospital
for treatment cites her as a
potential child abuser accord-
ing to the prevailing accepted
studies,” she continues.

The separation of a child
from its family, especially if it
is prolonged or repeated
during the child’s first three
years, can have damaging
far-reaching effects according
to John Bowlby, an English
psychiatrist, in his book
Attachment and Loss, Vol. II,
Separation. The child's feeling
of detachment may last an
entire lifetime stunting “the
child's personality, outlook on
life, ability to trust, to love
and eventual independence.”

William Byler, executive
director of the Association on
American Indian Affairs, test-
ified that 25 to 35 percent of
all Indian children are placed
in foster or adoptive homes or
institutions. He said that
social workers who are ignor-
ant of Indian customs “fre-
quently discover neglect or
abandonment where none
exists.”

Estrada Lifestyle

Patricia Estrada came to
Colorado from California
where she worked for seven
years with the problems of
welfare and their effects on
people. She receives welfare,
has one daughter with her in
Denver and two other daugh-
ters and three grandchildren
in California. She is personal-
ly challenging being forced to
go into WIN since she is busy
working with Chicana Welfare
Rights. “I have a job. I’m just
not getting paid for it. I did this
same thing when I was on
welfare in California and was
considered a Case Aid and got
paid for it. I helped to get a
group off the ground to fight
WIN. Then I decided to come
to Colorado, principally to put
my daughter in Escuela
Tlatelolco. The public school
system is so bad. I am also
refusing to accept child care
provided by the Welfare
Department. I am the only one
who can provide child care to
my child because of our
culture. So I should be given
child care money for doing so
this summer.

“The foster homes that
Chicano children are placed in
when they are taken from their
parents do not provide Chica-
no culture. The Welfare
Department says ‘Well, get us
more Chicano foster mothers.’
Bullshit. We all know that we
can’t meet their qualifica-
tions.

“When we win a case in
court by having the child
returned to its home, what
do we really win? There is
always a Stipulation of so
many visits per month by the
visiting nurse and social
worker. That social worker,
their expert Spanish-speaking
Anglo, is the one who causes
the trouble in the first place by
imposing her middle-class
standards on the Chicana.
Having her return to the home
just makes the mother more
defensive.”

Chicana’s Babies Taken

In one case, Ms. Estrada
says, all but two children were
returned to the mother. The
two who were kept had the
lightest skin. “How can she be
a good mother for all of her
children except the two with
the fairest complexions?” She
feels that the prevalence of
birth control and abortion in
the country has caused a
shortage of adoptable child-
ren. “The gringo is no longer
producing the blue-eyed, light
skinned baby. So the Chica-
na’s babies are being taken
away from her.”

“Women who are on wel-
fare,” she continues, “are
forced to go to clinics where
the personnel try to convince
them to use birth control
methods to limit the size of
their families. This is simply
preparing the Chicana for
forced sterilization.

“Living on welfare is a
matter of survival. If there
were any other place to go
other than to welfare, we
would be there. With welfare
money you get only enough to
survive on - enough to exist.
You can't buy soap or toilet
paper with food stamps and
so when your kids are dirty
you are accused of neglecting
them. We need the support of
all women's groups to fight
the Talmadge Amendment. I
would like to see a woman
lawyer working with Chicana
Welfare Rights. We mothers
do this work because it has to
be done. We're doing it for the
agencies that don’t do the job
that they are supposed to be
doing.”

we are serious.” One thing
she said women would have to
try to do is hold their temper
because sometimes it seems
pretty hopeless. She pointed
out that Third World women
have the most trouble as they
can’t afford babysitters and,
as with the United Farm
Workers boycott, they had to
take their children with them
to the picket lines.

After the guest speakers,
we broke into the following
workshops: (1) Affirmative
Action, (2) Women's Partici-
pation in Their Unions, (3)
Legislative and Political Ac-
tion and (4) Organizing the
Unorganized. A consensus of
the workshops wasn’t given at
the conference but will be
mailed to the participants.

Area Caucuses Planned

Area caucuses were then
held with the largest number
of women being from the
Denver and Boulder area.
Denver voted to have their first
Denver chapter meeting on
Sunday, June 30th at 1 p.m. at
the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union Hall on 1636
Champa. Any women inter-
ested should contact Debbie
Singer, PO Box 4274, Denver
80204 or Shirley Jackman,
8441 McDougal St., Denver
80229, for further information.

Although as a group CLUW
did not call themselves
feminists they can be a very
strong arm for the women’s
movement. I left feeling
strength that comes with
being able to experience
women working together.

OF WOMEN PERFORMERS
WHO COULD DONATE THEIR
TIME AND TALENT. ANY
WOMEN INTERESTED SHOULD
CONTACT CHRIS, 843 17TH ST.,

CU to Offer 2-week
Institute on Women

Who is the American woman?
What is her history? Where is
she now? The opportunity to
explore this new research, to
connect it with contemporary
experience and future possi-
bility, will be available this
summer at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, during a
two-week Institute, July 29
through August 9.

The Institute will make an
intensive examination of the
myths and realities of women
in society. Its basic approach
will be sharing: the sharing of
ideas and information among
academic disciplines and the
sharing of experiences and
insights among students and
teachers. Participants should
find this orientation both
scholarly and congenial. Day
care will be provided for those
participants who bring child-
ren. For further information

VICTIM

I had just moved into a house. A friend of mine was coming to Colorado and we were going to share the house. I was talking on the phone to her when all of a sudden the line went dead. I thought that we were disconnected but then I realized that the phone was completely dead - I couldn't get the operator or anything. I followed the cord into the hallway where I found it in two pieces. I thought that my cats had chewed it and got some tape to fix it. Then I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye.

I knew that someone was there so I said “Who is it?” A young, scruffy hippie walked into the living room. He had on an army jacket and blue jeans and wore shoulder-length hair. He stood there with both hands in his pockets. I asked him what he wanted and then I went cold. I thought: don’t mess around with this guy - see what he wants.

I remembered going to a rape conference of Radical Feminists in Philadelphia, where rape victims talked to other women about their assaults and the thing that these women said over and over was that they kept talking to their assailant at first while they tried to piece things together and decide what to do.

All this time my body was cold. I was so scared with fear. He didn’t match my image of a rapist. He looked like an ordinary guy. I pleaded with him not to hurt me - not to kill me. I thought he had a knife in one of his hands. He said “I don’t want to hurt you. I want to love you. Relax, baby, you'll love it, baby.” I thought of escape but realized that I had locked myself into my house by all the safety precautions I had installed. If I screamed, I thought, no one will hear me since it’s so late and maybe it will make him mad and then he will hurt me. The whole time I didn’t know if he was going to kill me or beat me up.

He pulled me into the bedroom and raped me. While he was raping me he grabbed my hand. This was the first time I felt that he wasn’t going to kill me. We were both victims.

He left. I called some friends of mine who came right over. I was very calm but I was hysterical. I wanted to go to the hospital for the examination before I talked to the police. I didn’t want to go to Denver General. I called Rose Memorial but they refused to take care of me in their emergency room. Then I called a private gynecologist to see me. (He is the head of OB-GYN at a big Denver hospital), my friends took me there. All the doctor said while he was there was “disgusting.” Nothing else except when a nurse gave me some DES and I questioned the side effects, he yelled from an adjoining room “that only happens in 1% of all cases.”

""+ Sex Detail Strikes -

The police had arrived at the hospital and gave my friends a hard time for being there. I told the officer in charge quite clearly that I wanted to talk to a policewoman. He said that I couldn't because there were no policewomen on the detail. Women have recently been put on the detail to placate everybody although the women they have on it are not supportive and are out to prove that we're lying.

I told them that I didn’t want to talk at the hospital and that I would meet them at my house. I was told that my friends couldn’t come when they talked to me. “We prefer to do interviews alone. We don’t want you to be influenced.” The police always seem to prefer not to have any other people there when they talk to you. And make you believe it is “law” or “preference.” The attitude of the

RAPE

LEGISLATION

The second rape that takes place in the courtroom has finally been recognized as possibly the biggest detriment to a woman's reporting her assault. Feminism is creating a consciousness in women that can no longer accept the existence of the rapist whether he be of the body or of the mind. But criminal codes that define rape and traditional courtroom proceedings that determine the treatment of the alleged rapist and his victim have been created by and for a patriarchal society that is blatantly sexist and anti-woman. And it is the confluent conflict of these socio-political forces that have provided adequate motivation for the District Attorney’s office to present proposals on rape and victim compensation that are to be given top priority for legislative action.

Richard Wood, a chief deputy district attorney who represents the office in legislative matters, says that the D.A.'s office is “very open to any input into this legislation.” He has already met with representatives of almost all of the organizations in the Denver area that are concerned with rape.

Although some of the proposals are controversial, he expects to see some legislative action and would like to see the Colorado District Attorney’s Association sponsor the bill but “if they won’t then the D.A.’s office will.” According to Wood, the former chief deputy of Public Defenders of the State supports the bill. The Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News have come out editorially in favor of the legislation. “I haven't seen any broad opposition to this legislation,” says Wood.

Abolish “Lord Hale”

The first proposal deals with the “Lord Hale” instruction that most judges in Colorado give the jury at the beginning of a rape trial warning them that the charge of rape “is one easily made and once made, difficult to defend against.”

This instruction unnecessarily singles out rape cases for special treatment, for special “comment” on the victim’s testimony and allegation, and in doing so, tends to prejudice the victim's case. The proposal is that this instruction is not to be given in any rape or sexual assault trial.

The second proposal is one which will prohibit admission into evidence in rape or sexual assault cases testimony relating to the victim's previous sexual conduct on the issue of consent or submission except as it may relate to the victim’s prior sexual conduct with the defendant.

“We think that anyone can be raped. A prostitute can be raped. A jury holds it against a woman if she doesn’t have a sexual life they feel she should,” says Wood. “The testimony that a woman can be forced to give concerning her previous sexual life is often highly irrelevant and can go back several years. Some judges won't allow this kind of fishing expedition of a defense attorney but it is still up to the individual judge and it is generally admitted into evidence.

“Half of the victims reported that if they had to do it again they wouldn't report their rape because of the cross-examination that occurs at the preliminary hearing and at the trial.

“The prohibition of such testimony would hopefully have the effect of encouraging victims to report and prosecute rapes and sexual assaults without fear of public humiliation.”

A proposal similar to this was defeated in Iowa but a substitute was passed that stated that if the defense counsel wanted to inquire into the victim's past sexual history he or she would have to do so in court chambers. If the judge felt that the testimony was relevant then that and only that would be brought out in the trial. This idea has been incorporated into the Colorado proposal.

HELP

The Denver Coalition on Sexual Assault was organized in March of this year for the purposes of education, rape prevention, encouraging women to report rapes, and providing advocacy services for women.

An ACTION grant that was to be used to recruit volunteers for the coalition was initially approved and then delayed due to alleged budget error on the part of Congress.

The coalition was initially formed to meet the increasing demand for a city-wide agency to deal with victimization. When the Southeast Denver Neighborhood Services Bureau opened it was deluged with calls from all over the city concerning rape victimization programs. It didn't have the money, space, or people to work in the entire city. “We were racing all over...trying to do everything...there just weren't enough of us...so the coalition was formed,” says Dr. Katherine Saltzman, victimization coordinator for SEDNSB.

The coalition sponsored four conferences in May and had a city-wide conference in March. There are task forces to deal with specific areas of concern such as counseling, legislation, victim rap, speakers bureau, health care, minority member, and mass media.

“The coalition needs people power,” says Ms. Saltzman. The summer months have a greater incidence of rape compared to other seasons. The general public that composes juries in rape trials and who are traditionally unsympathetic to rape victims need to gain understanding of the entire issue of rape and the victim. The coalition does not take any particular political approach to the rape issue. Screaming and ranting turns people off. We require some kind of political sophistication.

“The coalition has both men and women, some of whom are victims working with it who need periodic rests.”

Almost any organization or institution in Denver that deals with rape (with the exceptions of the Denver Police Department and their Sex Offense Detail) is represented in the Denver Coalition on Sexual Assault. Both the professional from the District Attorney's office and the woman who works all day at home work together on a common concern - rape.

A Child Advocacy Task Force is being formed in the coalition with the intent of making the child the primary concern in any courtroom proceedings. Often parents won't prosecute their child's molester because of fear of the treatment that the child may get in an open courtroom.

The Counseling Task Force is currently working on a pamphlet for preventive counseling, on counseling immediately after the rape and on long-range counseling through professional and victim-rap groups.

In the past the Victim Rap Task Force has taken part in guided fantasy which is a non-threatening way to get in touch with your feelings. Each rap session will have a specific topic or area of discussion.

The Speakers Task Force has people available to speak to any group that requests it.

The Health Care Task Force is investigating the indiscriminate use of DES (diethyl-stilbestrol), the morning-after pill that is given by emergency room doctors to women who have been raped and were using no form of birth control at the time. The objection is that women are usually not told, or are told after they have taken DES, that it may be harmful to them, cause cancer, affect future children. Often OB-GYN residents are

Dear Big Mama Rag:

I think that the NOW  
conference (Ed. Note: Held in  
Texas in June. See article p21)  
was a near total disaster as  
were the Sexuality and Lesbi-  
anism workshops. Virtually all  
that was accomplished in  
three days was election of  
officers - the rest of the time  
was frittered away by parlia-  
mentary procedure, politick-  
ing, and factional in-fighting.  
This has definitely got to be  
the low point in NOW’s  
history and from here we  
either move ahead or strangle  
to death. My faith in NOW  
would have been destroyed,  
except that Karen DeCrow, by  
far the most radical of the  
presidential candidates, was  
elected along with a progres-  
sive National Board.

When the Sexuality and  
Lesbianism workshops finally  
did happen, they were poorly  
organized. The National Task  
Force (on Lesbianism) has  
nothing to show for its 18  
months of existence. As far as  
I know, only five to ten chapters  
in the country have a thriving  
and active Lesbian Task  
Force. Gay caucuses were  
held several times, but I didn’t  
get very many constructive  
ideas to bring back to our  
chapter. I heard one horror  
story after another of mis-  
treatment of Lesbians in local

chapters, ranging from un-  
conscious misunderstanding  
to outright oppression.

NOW has two good resolu-  
tions standing from the last  
two National Conferences,  
but implementation is the  
problem. Many chapters have  
actively disregarded these  
resolutions in order to pre-  
serve their community reputa-  
tion, especially in the vulner-  
able regions where the ERA  
has not been ratified. All in all  
it was a discouraging scene  
and I left the conference with  
more doubts about the Lesbi-  
ans' place in NOW than I went  
with.

I pretty much feel now that  
the Lesbians in Ft. Collins  
must unite politically as a  
separate group and articulate  
our common oppression. In  
the meantime, Lesbians with-  
in Ft. Collins NOW are  
coming out and becoming  
more and more visible (as am  
I). We can educate and  
influence our fellow NOW  
members on matters dealing  
with Lesbianism, but the real  
action has to happen outside  
the NOW chapter...

Congratulations on your  
recent publications of BMR -  
they've been packed full of  
good, enjoyable reading.

Dear Brothers & Sisters:

I am writing to you from a  
Federal Prison Hospital, where  
I am involved in trying to start a  
Gay group. And also in getting  
Gay books put in the library, and  
at least one Gay book sold in the  
commissary. The straight people  
have the Playboy sold to them  
every month when it comes out.  
And there are books on every  
subject except the Gay people in  
the library.

So if you have any ideas that  
might help me get done what  
I want done and what needs done  
in ALL PRISONS, please let me  
know, I will answer all letters that  
come to me.

Please excuse the form letter,  
but I am writing to all the people  
that I have addresses to. So that  
I can get all kinds of information  
that will help.

BigMammaRag,3,2,,4,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol3No2_page004.txt,"RAPE

I have never been free of the fear  
of rape. From a very early age, like  
most women, I have thought of rape as  
part of my natural environment—  
something to be feared and prayed  
against like fire or lightning. I never  
asked why men raped; I simply  
thought it one of the many mysteries  
of human nature.

I was, however, curious enough  
about the violent side of humanity to  
read every crime magazine I was able  
to ferret away from my grandfather.  
Each issue featured at least one “sex  
crime,” with pictures of a victim,  
usually in a pearl necklace, and of the  
ditch or the orchard where her body  
was found. I was never certain why the  
victims were always women, nor what  
the motives of the murderer were, but I  
did guess that the world was not a  
safe place for women. I observed that  
my grandmother was meticulous  
about locks, and quick to draw the  
shades before anyone removed so  
much as a shoe. I sensed that danger  
lurked outside.

At the age of eight, my  
suspicions were confirmed. My  
grandmother took me to the back of  
the house where the men wouldn't  
hear and told me that strange men  
wanted to do harm to little girls. I  
learned not to walk on dark streets,  
not to talk to strangers, or get into  
strange cars, to lock doors, and to be  
modest. She never explained why a  
man would want to harm a little girl  
and I never asked.

If I thought for a while that my  
grandmother's fears were imaginary,  
the illusion was brief. That year, on  
the way home from school, a school-  
mate a few years older than I tried to  
rape me. Later, in an obscure aisle of  
the local library (while I was reading  
Freddy the Pig) I turned to discover a  
man exposing himself. Then, the  
friendly man around the corner was  
arrested for child molesting.

An Uncle, A Father

My initiation to sexuality was  
typical. Every woman has similar  
stories to tell—the first man who  
attacked her may have been a  
neighbor, a family friend, an uncle,  
her doctor, or perhaps her own father.  
And women who grow up in New York  
City always have tales about the  
subway.

But though rape and the fear of  
rape are a daily part of every woman’s  
consciousness, the subject is so  
rarely discussed by that unofficial  
staff of male intellectuals (who write  
the books which study seemingly  
every other form of male activity) that  
one begins to suspect a conspiracy of  
silence. And indeed, the obscurity of  
rape in print exists in marked contrast  
to the frequency of rape in reality, for  
forcible rape is the most frequently  
committed violent crime in America  
today. The Federal Bureau of  
Investigation classes three crimes as  
violent: murder, aggravated assault  
and forcible rape. In 1968, 31,060  
rapes were reported. According to the  
FBI and independent criminologists,  
however, to approach accuracy this  
figure must be multiplied by at least a  
factor of ten to compensate for the  
fact that most rapes are not reported;  
when these compensatory mathematics  
are used, there are more rapes  
committed than aggravated assaults  
and homicides.

When I asked Berkeley, Cali-  
fornia's Police Inspector in charge of

The All-American Crime

small part has been edited.

woman might prevent being raped, he  
was not so reticent, “I wouldn’t advise  
any female to go walking around alone  
at night ...she should lock her car at  
all times.” The Inspector illustrated  
his warning with a grisly story about a  
man who lay in wait for women in the  
back seats of their cars, while they  
were shopping in a local supermarket.  
This man eventually murdered one of  
his rape victims. “Always lock your  
car,” the Inspector repeated, and then  
added, without a hint of irony, “Of  
course, you don’t have to be paranoid  
about this type of thing.”

The Inspector wondered why I  
wanted to write about rape. Like most  
men he did not understand the  
urgency of the topic, for, after all, men  
are not raped. But like most women I  
had spent considerable time speculating  
on the true nature of the rapist.  
When I was very young, my image of  
the sexual offender was a nightmarish  
amalgamation of the bogey man and  
Captain Hook: He wore a black cape,  
and he cackled. As I matured, so did  
my image of the rapist. Rape, I came  
to believe, was only one of the many  
unfortunate evils produced by sexual  
repression. Reasoning by tautology, I  
concluded that any man who would  
rape a woman must be out of his  
mind.

Rapists as Insane

Though the theory that rapists  
are insane is a popular one, this belief  
has no basis in fact. According to  
Professor Menachem Amir's study of  
646 rape cases in Philadelphia,  
Patterns in Forcible Rape, men who  
rape are not abnormal. Amir writes,  
“Studies indicate that sex offenders  
do not constitute a unique or  
psychopathological type; nor are they  
as a group invariably more disturbed  
than the control groups to which they  
are compared.” Alan Taylor, a parole  
officer who has worked with rapists in  
the prison facilities at San Luis  
Obispo, California, stated the ques-  
tion in plainer language, “Those men  
were the most normal men there. They  

had a lot of hang-ups, but they were  
the same hang-ups as men walking  
out on the streets.”

Another canon in apologetics of  
rape is that, if it were not for learned  
social controls, all men would rape.  
Rape is held to be natural behavior,  
and not to rape must be learned. But  
in truth rape is not universal to the  
human species. Moreover studies of  
rape in our culture reveal that, far from  
being impulsive behavior, most rape is  
planned. Professor Amir’s study  
reveals that in cases of group rape (the  
“gangbang” of masculine slang) 90  
percent of the rapes were planned; in  
pair rapes, 83 percent of the rapes  
were planned; and in single rapes, 58  
percent were planned. These figures  
should significantly discredit the  
image of the rapist as a man who  
suddenly is overcome by sexual needs  
society does not allow him to fulfill.

Far from the social control of  
rape being learned, comparisons with  
other cultures lead one to suspect  
that, in our society, it is rape itself  
that is learned. (The fact that rape is  
against the law should not be  

considered proof that rape is not in  

fact encouraged as part of our  
culture.)

This culture’s concept of rape as  
an illegal, but still understandable,  
form of behavior is not a universal  
one. In her study “Sex and  
Temperament,” Margaret Mead de-  
scribes a society that does not share  
our views. The Arapesh do not “…have  
any conception of the male nature that  
might make rape understandable to  
them.” Indeed our interpretation of  
rape is a product of our conception of  
the nature of male sexuality. A  
common retort to the question, why  
don’t women rape men, is the myth  
that men have greater sexual needs,  
that their sexuality is more urgent than  
women’s. And it is the nature of  
human beings to want to live up to  
what is expected of them.

And this same culture which  
expects aggression from the male  

expects passivity from the female.  
Conveniently, the companion myth  
about the nature of female sexuality is  
that all women secretly want to be  
raped. Lurking beneath her modest  
female exterior is a subconscious  
desire to be ravished. The following  
description of a stag movie, written by  
Brenda Starr in Los Angeles’ under-  
ground paper, “Everywoman,” typifies  
this male fantasy. The movie “showed  
a woman in her underclothes reading  
on her bed. She is interrupted by a  
rapist with a knife. He immediately  
wins her over with his charm and they  
get busy sucking and fucking.” An  
advertisement in the “Berkeley Barb”  
reads, “Now as all women know from  
their daydreams, rape has a lot of  
advantages. Best of all it's so simple.  
No preparation necessary, no plan-  
ning ahead of time, no wondering if  
you should or shouldn't; just whang!  
bang!” Thanks to Masters and  
Johnson even the scientific canon  
recognizes that for the female,  
“whang! bang!” can scarcely be  
described as pleasurable.  
You Loved It!

Still, the male psyche persists  
in believing that, protestations and  
struggles to the contrary, deep inside  
her mysterious feminine soul, the  
female victim has wished for her own  
fate. A young woman who was raped  
by the husband of a friend said that  
days after the incident the man  
returned to her home, pounded on the  
door and screamed to her, “Jane, Jane.  
You loved it. You know you loved it.”

The theory that women like  
being raped extends itself by  
deduction into the proposition that  
most or much of rape is provoked by  
the victim. But this too is only myth.  
Though provocation, considered a  
mitigating factor in a court of law, may  
consist of only “a gesture,” according  
to the Federal Commission on Crimes  
of Violence, only 4 percent of reported  
rapes involved any precipitative  
behavior by the woman.

The notion that rape is enjoyed  
by the victim is also convenient for the  
man who, though he would not  
commit forcible rape, enjoys the idea  
of its existence, as if rape confirms  
that enormous sexual potency which  
he secretly knows to be his own. It is  
for the pleasure of the armchair rapist  
that detailed accounts of violent rapes  
exist in the media. Indeed, many men  
appear to take sexual pleasure from  
nearly all forms of violence. Whatever  
the motivation, male sexuality and  
violence in our culture seem to be  
inseparable. James Bond alternately  
whips out his revolver and his cock and  
though there is no known connection  
between the skills of gun-fighting and  
love-making, pacifism seems suspi-  
ciously effeminate.

In a recent fictional treatment of  
the Manson case, Frank Conroy writes  
of his vicarious titillation when  
describing the murders to his wife:

“Every single person there  
was killed.” She didn’t move.

“It sounds like there was  
torture,” I said. As the words  
left my mouth I knew there was  
no need to say them to frighten  
her into believing that she  
needed me for protection.”

The pleasure he feels as his  
wife’s protector is inextricably mixed  
with pleasure in the violence itself.  
Conroy writes, “I was excited by the  
killings, as one is excited by  

catastrophe on a grand scale, as one is  
alert to pre-echoes of unknown  
changes, hints of unrevealed secrets,  
rumblings of chaos…”

To: The Denver Sustaining Fund

From: The BIG MAMA RAG Collective

The Big Mama Rag Collective has decided that it will not be
returning to the DSF for additional funding in the future.

BMR has also decided to withdraw its membership in the DSF
because we feel that such participation is a drain of our energies
and a waste of time. We will be working with the women’s
community to raise the money we need to continue.

This decision was made by an overwhelming majority of the
women present at our meeting of July 14, 1974.

BMR also wants to state officially that we deeply appreciate the
support and help we received from the many community women
who attended the July 10 meeting of the DSF and from Kathy De
Paolo and Jim McNulty of the Board of Directors of DSF.

THE BOARD

The boys were playing their inherited role as bankers. We
unfortunately fell into the position of answering their absurd
questions of financial projections in similar terms instead of our
own politics - the necessity and vision of a woman's world...

The boys are only interested in supporting their own sense of
self-importance, $400 per month worth while funding the sacred
community $200...

I think the main issues were not dealt with. The underlying
conflict was the leftist male analysis and with it their priorities -
which are the male-defined community and a class analysis which
excludes the real status and experience of women in a sexist
society.

Janet Sergi

When the women from different groups offered support to BMR
at the DSF meeting, I was very excited. While I’ve been in Denver, I
have not seen support and strength to the degree I saw here. I felt
our roots growing together, strengthening the women’s
community. The fear I saw from some other people makes me
wonder how the DSF can presently hope to work with the
community if it is threatened by the community and the potentials
within it! The fund itself has a potential which won't be met until it
deals with its own fear...

Lynda Hartman

THE AUDIENCE

Putting out the newspaper is our first priority and the reason we
originally went to the DSF. Many hours of the staff's time was
spent writing and reworking proposals. It was our feeling that the
constant demand for new proposals was a way of evading the
issue of funds for BMR...

It is hypocritical for groups within the DSF with no working
class basis to criticize BMR for not having that basis. To us,
working class can be defined as living from paycheck to
paycheck. This definition applies to many of the women who
read BMR. It can therefore be stated that we do have ties with the
working class. We doubt that this is true of most of the groups
within the DSF.

—Carol Hansford, Kate Sharp

THE STORY

The following is a recapitulation of basic facts which led
to the controversy with the Denver Sustaining Fund:

1. BMR was a member of the
Denver Sustaining Fund
(DSF), a “radical” funding
source for “alternative”
groups.

2. June 18 - BMR found
herself broke.
3. June 19 - BMR submitted a
proposal to DSF for money:
$3500.

4. July 19 - BMR sent home
with empty pockets.
5. June 20 - BMR pissed off -
wrote new proposal: $1500.
6. July 10 - BMR and 50
female supporters submitted
second proposal and raised
hell.
7. July 10 - Being a chip off
the old block, the DSF sent us
home with $250. Told us to
“Come again, ladies.”
8. July 14 - LIBERATION DAY!
BMR decided to bring it all
back home. i.e.,
a.) to not return to the
DSF
b.) to withdraw from the
DSF

BMR found

c.) to get it together with
the sisters for support.

THE EDITORS

Bringing it all back home is what this confrontation has been
about. Though surfacely - and even in an unconscious lie to
themselves - the DSF feels ultimately liberated that they don’t
need to be educated, their actions show they are missing the
point. The “radicals” turned out to be the Establishment Wed.
night—their $250. A “no” to a vision. They did not see women
forced to go before them as anything more than the girls trying to
get their shit together. The terms for granting money were
superlatively capitalistic - the justifications were in terms
of money, cost flow charts, return probabilities, etc...

Men have had print since Gutenberg. They sought in the word a
reflection of themselves AND in 500 years have failed to make the
word real, to give back to the earth sinew and life. Since 1968, six
years of birthing, the Women’s Movement has realized the full
capacity of media and sisterhood to be unifying. That by joining
together with paper and bookstore as part of the focus, women
can renew the journey. This time around that train full of poetry,
not dialectic, calling women on board in true coalition, has
arrived.

Sandy Belgrade (“the woman in the purple shirt”)

I was under the impression that the DSF represented some sort
of counter culture community here in Denver. Upon closer
analysis, however, I find that the member groups do not seem to
represent any kind of broader community... Therefore, I believe
that we do not have anything to gain by dealing with this group of
people. We have a large and growing women’s community here in
Denver that is visible and supportive and ready to move. This is
the area we should concentrate on...

Basically I’m bored with the boys and with their games,
intellectual masturbation and static social hierarchies. I think we
can get alternative funding without demeaning ourselves or our
sisters. The DSF is basically a boy’s illusion and we've had the
privilege of exposing it.

Maureen Mrizek

I feel like I just been had and with my assistance. What fools! A
$250 “NO.”... For the kind of time and effort we have given the
DSF we could have brought together the entire women’s
community of Denver... I am saying right now that my life and my
energies are for women - not for the male ego and not for male
political games... BIG MAMA LIVES!

Local Women’s Band

Says What They Think

Bourge Miller

Beverly Mayes, Sylvia Brady, Sharon Bankes. Three talented women who, as individuals, have come together to form the musical group known as B.S. Sugar and Company. Although the group is now in what they call its “infant stages,” none of the women are strangers to professional music. Beverly and Sylvia, who are sisters, started performing as a duo 11 years ago in California. They have performed together off and on ever since. Two and a half years ago Sharon, who sung with various rock groups, joined them and a close personal and musical bond was formed.

Sylvia, who plays primarily lead guitar, designed and built the sound system they now use. Beverly, who along with Sharon, lends her considerable vocal talents to the group, plays both 12-string and bass guitar.

In a small room in the Capital Plaza Inn, crowded with the activity of preparing for the evening's show, they talked about their music, its message, and its place in raising a larger consciousness in all of us.

BMR: As women, do you generally dress for your audience, giving a great deal of thought to projecting yourself visually in a certain way?

SHARON: We're not trying to get into a bag of three women looking alike, but we are trying to project a group image. Too often the people are maybe attracted to one thing on the stage and not us as a group. It’s like we want...we’re blending in with each other as much as with our music.

BEV: We do wish to produce a very solid front. A very solid group image. The group is a coordination of all of our efforts and we want our group image to be a coordination of all of our efforts.

The women consider that they are a local product musically. Beverly and Sharon had given up music in California because of the ways in which they felt they were being taken advantage of as women. Never quite being able to escape those particular circumstances until recently, they had not performed for ten months prior to this current engagement, preferring to devote their time and energy developing their other talents and strengths.

BEV: The bar scene is very difficult to handle because you constantly have people pulling at you and drawing everything away from you and not really adding anything back.

But they decided to regroup and start again after realizing that music was their deepest interest and because

BEV: ...from an economic standpoint we found that as women we can make more money doing music for a few hours a day.

SYLVIA: We're not being sold as sex objects either in our performances or otherwise. And I think perhaps that’s what was wrong before. We became a product.

BMR: Are there any specific problems or disappointments in marketing your music or yourselves as a group that you feel have grown out of being an all-women’s band?

SYLVIA: There is wonderment on many people's part at first. It’s a relatively new thing. Women coming together in groups to do things has been an unusual thing culturally. I would say we meet reluctance, but not non-acceptance. So far.

BEV: Of course whenever you're doing this type of thing, you’re in essence in a fishbowl and people are going to pick you apart. But from a behind-the-scenes standpoint, when Sylvia and I were together, I felt we were a freak. People would come just strictly to see what two girls were doing.

SHARON: (laughing) Now they come to see what three are doing.

BEV: In some instances we were catered to because we were women. In other instances we met with very strong opposition because we had more or less crossed a barrier.

BMR: Women aren’t supposed to do that sort of thing?

BEV: It’s alright if they do it, but they can’t be good at it.

SHARON: And that can’t be their main objective.

BEV: Not if you're playing an instrument. If you were a singer or a tambourine player or wore a sexy gown, that was fine. You were in your place and limited.

BMR: Don’t you think that’s symptomatic of the culture rather than the music business?

BEV: Yes, but that’s being alleviated. We don’t seem to meet the same opposition now. There is a certain acceptance now that we are women, we do this thing, and do it reasonably well. We’re not put down nor do other people feel threatened by us.

BMR: Don’t you think the women’s movement has helped that?

BEV: Yes, and we've found we appeal to a very wide variety of people... so ultimately we would like to have a message.

BMR: Is there one group of people or a particular audience you ultimately want to speak to through your music?

BEV: I think my message, and I don’t know if Sharon and Sylvia would go along with me completely, would be the total raising of everyone’s consciousness. To help people accept one another as human beings. First. Second, whatever else. I am a person first,

“We have to get our foot in the door first,” says Sharon Bankes, a member of the all-women band known as B.S. Sugar. From left to right: Sylvia Brady, Sharon Bankes, and Beverly Mayes. Photo By Germain Munoz

then a musician, then a woman. I feel that human beings can accept each other as human beings on a more open level. I feel we should look at one another first as persons and then whatever you do. And not put somebody down because they do something different than you or feel differently or act differently. I feel we have to learn to allow space for one another and at the same time being careful that our space doesn't infringe on someone else's.

BMR: That’s a very humanistic philosophy. Are any or all of you strong Feminists?

SHARON: In my own little realm I never had that much difficulty being a woman. I mostly spaced everybody out anyway. Lately, I’ve come to realize the difficulty in being a woman first. First you've got to prove something there. Then maybe they’ll look at your other talents. If they think you have one.

SYLVIA: I have a very humanistic feeling about the whole race. But there are problems women face, I’ve certainly faced a few in my life, that need to be equalized.

BEV: I think there are a lot of inequities in many areas. And until we as human beings can learn to live with one another those inequities will exist. The Feminist Movement, Black, Chicano, Gay Liberation. To me that’s like taking an aspirin when you should be taking penicillin. I think it’s treating the symptoms, not the cause.

BMR: You must be aware that to many women you may already be a certain symbol of success. Another group of women who've “made it.” Do you feel a particular burden for that?

SHARON: No. Absolutely not. I feel like marching for it. But marching for it in my own way, O.K.? I can't go out and march for Gay Liberation, or march for women. I don’t have the time for one thing. But if we ever do make it big, maybe I could be in a better position to help someone or something.

BEV: At this particular moment we don’t have the space to allow for a lot of things we’d like to allow for. To sum up our feeling about the whole thing: you can only raise someone else to your level. So if you're here (indicating waist level) you can only bring them up this high. But if you're here (indicating a level above her head) you can bring them up this high. And so I think our primary effort at this time will be devoted to our music because our music is our method of communication. And it's not all that we want it to be because there's not been time to say everything we want to say. But it will get said.

BMR: So in a way you're making some concessions, in a sense, as a means to an end.

BEV: Right.

SHARON: Exactly.

SYLVIA: I don’t know what you mean by concessions.

BMR: I meant that there are certain things you want to do with your music. The type of music you were doing Saturday night was very middle of the road, popular tunes and so forth, but by and large designed not to offend. Commercial. I assume this is not the music you'd rather be doing, ultimately, but you're doing it for a purpose, i.e. to establish yourselves on a firm foundation to go on and do other things. In that sense I meant making a concession.

SYLVIA: Right. Exactly. That's the concession. I'd hoped you'd done it right.

BMR: There is an immense amount of power that any form of mass communication wields. Advertising is one. Music is really no different. And there is an enormous responsibility that goes with that power. With music, the means of communication are even broader because music is more universal. It transcends the language. Putting myself in your place, and being a strong Feminist, if I had your talents I'd want to use them to further that particular cause. I wonder if you feel the same and if you feel you have to hold yourselves back in some areas so as not to offend now in order to someday...

SHARON: ...we have to get our foot in the door first.

BEV: Right.

BEV: We intend to lay a very concrete foundation. Because of our ideas of Ourself, and I say Ourself as one, because we are as one. Individually we are stronger about some things than we are about others. Sylvia and Sharon are both probably stronger Feminists than I am. But by the same token, with Ourself, yes, I would say we are somewhat Feminist. And yes, I feel we have some messages in that.

SYLVIA: I think what she’s trying to get at... People need to work at all levels for their particular cause each person has their own little thing that suits them to work for. And we would work for something like that (Feminism) because things like that need to be done first before the larger consciousness that Beverly is talking about can be achieved. The Blacks need their freedom first, then they'll be equals and able to function on this great consciousness level... women, I think, need equality, then everybody’ll be able to function a little better. And I think you have to meet those things in very small ways. And that’s the thing we try to do that we aren't making any concessions about. For instance, something that we use when we go on the stage and it’s probably misleading culturally. Everybody does it and if we can do one small thing to change that, we will have done something. We say “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome” to wherever we are. Beverly said...don’t you think we should be using something like hello everybody, good evening persons, or something like that. To let people know those differences don't exist.

SHARON: That separation.

SYLVIA: And I feel things get done in these small ways. A person who is aware that there is an injustice or an inequality has to try to change it. People are culturally habituated to saying things that are not equal or not just. Habits are really hard to break, and people like us, who have some influence over what goes on... if we start changes, perhaps they'll manifest themselves in other people... I think it’s the small things you have to

officer in charge was “well, for every
victim who thinks that I don’t treat
her well, there are 5 who think that I
do.”

The next day when I went downtown
to do a composite drawing of the
rapist the man who I worked with on
the drawing said, after a few minutes
of work, “You're not so bad.” It seems
that the rumor had been circulated
that a real man-hater (me) was coming
down that day. When I was describing
the man they kept trying to talk me
into describing him as being a
Chicano. They practically told me that
it was a Chicano because the area I
lived in is near a Chicano neighbor-
hood.

The men at work didn't know how to
approach the fact that I had been
raped. Typical comments were: “did
you enjoy it?” “could you get off on
it?” There weren’t any visible signs of
what happened to me because I wasn't
beaten up. It was very shattering in a
middle-class way. This great tragedy
had happened inside me and some
people were so intolerant of what was
happening to me. Their attitude was
“sure you should be angry but get a
hold of yourself.”

My mom was so upset but she tried
not to show it. First she cried all the
time. She didn’t tell any of her friends.
She didn’t talk to me for two weeks.
She thought of me as a soiled,
shameful thing. Then one night I
called her and told her that I was not
guilty that the rape had nothing to do
with sex. It is violence. I am not
promiscuous, mother. It’s a good
thing that I had a good sense of my
own sexuality. The attack reinforced
things for me. It made my feminism

stronger. Men fuck women over. See, I
wasn't trying to say anything but,
he didn’t ask questions. He was just
there. He was my friend. Very
supportive. He boarded up the
basement window that the rapist
broke in through. The guy would never
have gotten on the first floor of the
house if the latch to the basement
door had been hooked. A friend had
been moving stuff into the basement
that day and had forgotten to latch it.

Friends got on me as to why I wasn’t
going out with men. The police felt
that the attack made me hate men. I
don’t hate men. I hate the male
system.

I see that rape is not a sexual crime.
It is a violent, aggressive, intimidating
crime. Sex is the way it is expressed.

Rapist Returns

About two weeks after the attack I
got home late with a friend. We went
in the house through the back door
and discovered that someone was
trying to get in through the front door.
It was the rapist. He had come back.
He ran down the street. We called the
police and five rookies showed up.
There were footprints in the snow and
fingerprints on the door, but they
didn’t take any of them. They didn’t
fingerprint the first time he broke

in. Another woman reported that a guy by the
same description had attempted to
attack her in a parking lot. She
scared him off and saw him disappear
into an alley. A car emerged with him in
it. She told police but I don’t know if
anything was done about attempting
to locate the car.

Then one rainy day I was driving
down Colfax when I saw him walking
on the street. I recognized him
immediately. I followed him and
reached up to clear my windshield of
fog when I accidentally hit the horn.
He saw me and ran into a house. I
called police and was criticized for not
having called earlier. But I didn't think
that they would get there on time and
he would have been gone. The car that
the other woman reported seeing him
in was parked in front of the house. He
lived within two blocks of me.

The police came to my house with
pictures of him which I identified. He
was arrested. I didn’t hear anything for
weeks. Then I was subpoenaed to be a
witness. I didn’t know why I was being
called since there was no explanation
of what I was appearing for.

The guy had attacked 15 women in a
6 block radius in 18 months. It
seems, he had been abused as a child.
Strapped to a bed when he was 5. A
loner - he had indecently exposed
himself 60 or 70 times. He had normal
sexual relations with other women. He
was a normal guy, just quiet and
withdrawn.

Two days before the preliminary
hearing I got a call from the District
Attorney’s office. They came with a
paralegal to get my story.

I wanted to know exactly what might
happen in the trial and what the
alternatives were for the defendant. A
woman lawyer kindly gave me an hour
of her time and explained what
penalties he might face if he was
found guilty. If he were found
innocent he would be free. If he were
found guilty he could be sent to Buena
Vista or to Canon City for 5 to 40
years, and could be paroled in as little
as a year. If he were sentenced under
the Sex Offenders Act, which was
established for the mentally or
criminally ill, he could be sentenced
for 1 day to life.

The Trial

His attorney was an older man and
the defendant put on the innocent
routine. He was charged with rape
seven times, breaking and entering
and deviant sexual intercourse. He
was such a scrawny little kid in the
courtroom. He seemed so big and
brutal that night.

He pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity and was sent to the State
Hospital at Pueblo for examination.
He admitted that he went around the

There are two definitions of insanity
- criminal and mental. The criminally
insane don’t know the difference
between right and wrong or are driven
by a force that they can’t control. The
rapist wasn’t found criminally insane.
He was found sane and the D.A. office
plea bargained - they figured, or so I
was told, that if he pleaded guilty he
could have been sentenced to Buena
Vista (since he was 18) and been

Kicking

To Block A Kick Or Punch
There is only one thing to remember in
doing a block, your third essential
technique. Sweep. The sweep ensures
that you will catch the blow (with your
arm instead of your body) no matter
what stage it’s in. In other words,
striking directly out at an incoming
fist will most likely result in a miss for
you and contact for him. But if you
sweep over the general area he’s
aiming for, you'll deflect the blow.
And if you do it firmly enough, you'll
hurt his arm as well as surprise him.

Heel of Palm Blow — flex your wrist,
stretch fingers back, tuck thumb in
(always do this; so that you don’t
accidentally catch your thumb on
something). Striking surface is that
nice strong bone called the heel of the
palm. Hit him under the chin, hard, or
on the end of his nose, a blow which
can be fatal if delivered with enough
force."

RAPE: The All-American Crime

From Page 3

The attraction of the male in our
culture to violence and death is a
tradition Manson and his admirers are
carrying on with tireless avidity (even
presuming Manson’s innocence, he
dreams of the purification of fire and
destruction). It was Malraux, in his
“Anti-Memoirs” who said that for the
male, facing death was the illumina-
ting experience analogous to child-
birth for the female. Certainly our
culture does glorify war and shroud
the agonies of the gun-fighter in veils
of mystery.

And in the spectrum of male
behavior, rape, the perfect combina-
tion of sex and violence, is the
penultimate act. Erotic pleasure
cannot be separated from culture, and
in our culture male eroticism is
wedded to power. Not only should a
man be taller and stronger than a
female in the perfect love-match, but
he must also demonstrate his superior
strength in gestures of dominance
which are perceived as amorous.
Though the law attempts to make a
clear division between rape and sexual
intercourse, in fact the courts find it
difficult to distinguish between a case
where the decision to copulate was
mutual and one where a man forced
himself upon his partner.

The scenario is even further
complicated by the expectation that,
not only does a woman mean “yes”
when she says “no,” but that a really
decent woman ought to begin by
saying “no,” and then be led down the
primrose path to acquiescence. Ovid,
the author of Western Civilization’s
most celebrated sex-manual, makes
this expectation perfectly clear:

..and when I beg you to say

“yes,” say “no.” Then let me lie

outside your bolted door....So

Love grows strong....

Rape in Heterosexual Relations

That the basic elements of rape
are involved in all heterosexual
relationships may explain why men
often identify with the offender in this
crime. But to regard the rapist as the
victim, a man driven by his inherent
sexual needs to take what will not be
given him, reveals a basic ignorance of
sexual politics. For in our culture
heterosexual love finds an erotic
expression through male dominance
and female submission. A man who
derives pleasure from raping a woman
clearly must enjoy force and domi-
nance as much or more than the
simple pleasures of the flesh. Coitus
cannot be experienced in isolation.
The weather, the state of the nation,
the level of sugar in the blood—all will
affect a man's ability to achieve
orgasm. If a man can achieve sexual
pleasure after terrorizing and humilia-
ting the object of his passion, and in
fact while inflicting pain upon her, one
must assume he derives pleasure
directly from terrorizing, humiliating
and harming a woman. According to
Amir's study of forcible rape, on a
statistical average the man who has
been convicted of rape was found to
have a normal sexual personality,
tending to be different from the
normal, well-adjusted male only in
having a greater tendency to express
violence and rage.

And if the professional rapist is
to be separated from the average
dominant heterosexual, it may be
mainly a quantitative difference. For
the existence of rape as an index to
masculinity is not entirely metaphori-
cal. Though this measure of masculi-
nity seems to be more publicly
exhibited among “bad boys” or aging
bikers who practice sexual initiation
through group rape, in fact, “good
boys” engage in the same rites to
prove their manhood.

In Stockton, a small town in
California which epitomizes silent
majority America, a bachelor party
was given last summer for a young
man about to be married. A woman
was hired to dance “topless” for the
amusement of the guests. At the high

point of the evening the bridegroom-
to-be dragged the woman into a
bedroom. No move was made by any
of his companions to stop what was
clearly going to be an attempted rape.
Far from it. As the woman described,
“I tried to keep him away—told him of
my Herpes Genitalis, et cetera, but he
couldn't face the guys if he didn't
screw me.” After the bridegroom had
finished raping the woman and
returned with her to the party, far from
chastizing him, his friends jeered the
woman and covered her with wine.
Force in Group Rape

It was fortunate for the dancer
that the bridegroom's friends did not
follow him into the bedroom for,
though one might suppose that in
group rape, since the victim is
outnumbered, less force would be
inflicted on her, in fact, Amir’s studies
indicate, “the most excessive degrees
of violence occurred in group rape.”
Far from discouraging violence, the
presence of other men may in fact
encourage sadism, and even cause the
behavior. In an unpublished study of
group rape by Gilbert Beis and Duncan
Cahpell, the authors refer to a study
by W.H. Blanchard which relates,
“The leader of the male group...appa-
rently precipitated and maintained the
activity, despite misgivings, because
of a need to fulfill the role that the
other two men had assigned to him. ‘I
was scared when it began to happen,’
he says. ‘I wanted to leave but I didn’t
want to say it to the other guys—you
know—that I was scared.’ ”

Thus it becomes clear that not
only does our culture teach men the
rudiments of rape, but society, or
more specifically other men, encour-
age the practice of it.

“Every man I meet wants to protect
me. Can't figure out what from.”
—Mae West

If a male society rewards
aggressive, domineering sexual beha-
vior, it contains within itself a sexual
schizophrenia. For the masculine man
is also expected to prove his mettle as
a protector of women. To the naive
eye, this dichotomy implies that men
fall into one of two categories: those
who rape and those who protect. In
fact, life does not prove so simple. In
a study euphemistically entitled “Sex
Aggression by College Men,” it was
discovered that men who believe in a
double standard of morality for men
and women, who in fact believe most
fervently in the ultimate value of
virginity, are more liable to commit
“this aggressive variety of sexual
exploitation.”

(At this point in our narrative it
should come as no surprise that Sir
Thomas Malory, creator of that classic
tale of chivalry, The Knights of the
Round Table, was himself arrested
and found guilty for repeated
incidents of rape.)

In the system of chivalry, men
protect women against men. This is

not unlike the protection relationship
which the mafia established with
small businesses in the early part of
this century. Indeed, chivalry is an
age-old protection racket which
depends for its existence on rape.
We Call It Chivalry
According to the male mytholo-
gy which defines and perpetuates rape,
it is an animal instinct inherent in the
male. The story goes that sometime in
our pre-historical past, the male, more
hirsute and burly than today’s
counterparts, roamed about an uncivi-
lized landscape until he found a

desirable female. (Oddly enough, this

female is not pictured as more
muscular than the modern woman).
Her mate does not bother with
courtship. He simply grabs her by the
hair and drags her to the closest cave.
Presumably, one of the major
advantages of modern civilization for
the female has been the civilizing of
the male. We call it chivalry.

But women do not get chivalry
for free. According to the logic of
sexual politics, we too have to civilize
our behavior. (Enter chastity. Enter
virginity. Enter monogamy.) For the
female, civilized behavior means
chastity before marriage and faithful-
ness within it. Chivalrous behavior in
the male is supposed to protect that
chastity from involuntary defilement.
The fly in the ointment of this
otherwise peaceful system is the
fallen woman. She does not behave.
Therefore, she does not deserve
protection. Or, to use another
argument, a major tenet of the same
value system: what has once been
defiled cannot again be violated. One
begins to suspect that it is the
behavior of the fallen woman and not
that of the male, that civilization aims
to control.

The assumption that a woman
who does not respect the double
standard deserves whatever she gets
(or at the very least “asks for it”)
operates in the courts today. While in
some states a man's previous rape
convictions are not considered admis-
sible evidence, the sexual reputation
of the rape victim is considered a
crucial element of the facts upon

which the court must decide inno-
cence or guilt...

According to the double stand-
ard a woman who has had sexual
intercourse out of wedlock cannot be
raped. Rape is not only a crime of
aggression against the body; it is a
transgression against chastity as
defined by men. When a woman is
forced into a sexual relationship, she
has, according to the male ethos,
been violated, but she is also defiled if
she does not behave according to the
double standard, by maintaining her
chastity, or confining her sexual
activities to a monogamous relation-
ship.

“Bad Girls” Get Raped

One should not assume, how-
ever, that a woman can avoid the
possibility of rape simply by behaving.
Though myth would have it that
mainly “bad girls” are raped, this
theory has no basis in fact. Available
statistics would lead one to believe
that a safer source is promiscuity. In a
study of rape done in the District of
Columbia, it was found that 82 percent
of the rape victims had a “good
reputation.” Even the Police Inspec-
tor’s advice to stay off the streets is
rather useless, for almost half of
reported rapes occur in the home of
the victim and are committed by a man
she has never before seen. Like
indiscriminate terrorism, rape can
happen to any woman, and few
women are ever without this knowledge...

Clearly the white man’s chivalry

is aimed only to protect the chastity of
“his” women.
As a final irony that same
system of sexual values from which
chivalry is derived has also provided
womankind with an unwritten code of
behavior, called femininity, which
makes a feminine woman the perfect
victim of sexual aggression. If being
chaste does not ward off the
possibility of assault, being feminine
certainly increases the chances that it
will succeed. To be submissive is to
defer to masculine strength; is to lack
muscular development or any interest
in defending oneself; is to let doors
be opened, to have one’s arm held.

Anne-Marie Sandquist was  
interviewed at one of her  
games by two young reporters  
from BMR, Sally Morgenstern  
and Jessica Fowler: BMR:  
Why did you start to play on a  
boy’s baseball team?  
Anne-Marie: There weren’t  
any girls’ teams and I wanted  
to play baseball.

BMR: How does your coach  
feel about your playing on the  
team?  
Anne-Marie: He was the one  
who let me play in the first  
place.

BMR: What did you want to  
do when you grow up?  
Anne-Marie: Play baseball.

BMR: How do the other  
players on the team feel about  
your playing?  
Anne-Marie: They all like me  
and don’t care if I play except  
for one guy and I can’t tell you  
his name.

BMR: Do your friends and  
neighbors care if you play on a  
boys’ team?  
Anne-Marie: My friends like  
me to play. Some of my  
neighbors don’t think I should  
be playing baseball.

Anne-Marie Goes to Bat

Anne-Marie Sandquist, a 9  
year old girl, is playing  
baseball for the Catholic  
Youth Recreation Association  
(CYRA), but it took a court  
order to do so. The CYRA,  
headed by Thomas E. Wilson  
of 850 Milwaukee St., took  
Anne-Marie off the Most  
Precious Blood Tigers team  
and forfeited two games in  
which she had played. They  
also fired coach Michael  
Ousley, who allowed her to  
play.

Following this, the Sand-  
quists went to court. Jean  
Dubossky, an American Civil  
Liberties Union member, filed  
a suit stating that Anne-Marie  
be allowed to play or the  
CYRA be unable to use  
city-owned parks. Denver Dis-  
trict Court Judge Robert  
Kingsley issued a 10-day  
restraining order on June 19  
which let her play until the  
case went to court.

The restraining order turned  
into a preliminary injunction  
on July 3, when the CYRA  
dropped its case. Anne-Marie is  
now able to participate until  
the end of this season and  
theoretically next season al-  
so. However, any other young  
woman wishing to play in the  
CYRA will also have to go  
through the court procedure.

The Sandquists are not  
satisfied with this, and an  
amended complaint has been  
filed, which will probably be  
heard this winter. While not a  
class action suit, the attor-  
neys hope for a declaratory  
statement that will affect  
more young women than  
Anne-Marie.

The real issue is not  
Anne-Marie Sandquist, but  
whether or not young women  
belong in organized team  
sports such as baseball.

One commonly repeated  
reason to keep young women  
out of team sports is that they  
are not as strong as boys.  
However, studies show that  
both sexes are equal in  
strength. Further, according  
to a Physician and Sports  
article, “Sex and the Little  
League,” women are in fact  
more advanced than men in  
bone development from ages  
8-12, the years of “little  
league” sports. There is also  
no evidence that women are  
more prone to bone breaks  
than men.

Another excuse is that  
traumatic impact, i.e. getting  
hit by a baseball, leads to  
breast cancer. Physician and  
Sports states that there is not  
any evidence to support this  
theory.

It is important that  
the sexes begin competing on an  
equal basis at an early age. It  
seems the only reason young  
women are kept out of team  
sports is male chauvinism on  
the part of directors, coaches,  
and parents.

Feminist Guide to Santa Fe

Hello sisters:

You may have read Linda’s
article on New Mexico Femin-
ism in the June issue of BMR.
Since Linda’s visit a lot of
exciting things have been
happening in Santa Fe that I’d
like to tell you about.

The biggest and best of all
those things is that we've
finally secured a huge new
women’s center! It’s a large
house at 220 Manhattan St.,
which will provide space for
Santa Fe women's health
services, our office and library
facilities, a large meeting
room and a place for our one
resident to live. The Women’s
Center is called the Gathering
(405-982-4716).

The Women’s Health Ser-
vices, which has been strug-
gling to survive financially,
recently received a small (very
small!) grant, and will now be
able to carry on three days a
week (W. - F. from 9-5). ~

Another recent develop-
ment in Santa Fe is the
Feminist Media Collective.
These sisters are working on a
series of films titled, “Women
of New Mexico”. For more
information about this contact
Mary or Ann at 405-982-8073.

We also have, at last, an
organized rape crisis line
which works out of the Santa
Fe Crisis Intervention Center
(listed in the phone directory).

The Santa Fe Women’s
Press has now become the

Santa Fe Community Press.
The women forming the core
of this group are heavy duty
Feminists, but are also
dedicated to Marxist-Socialist
principles. They want the
press to be a viable political
tool, available to all op-
pressed peoples and crossing
over the barriers of racial,
ethnic, sexual, economic, and
age backgrounds. For more
information call Maria, Kathy,
or Sue (405-983-1963).

Two other established pro-
jects which are currently
meeting at the Gathering are
the Women’s Prison Project
and Older Women’s Libera-
tion. The Lesbian Alliance
and a radical Feminist Rape
and Study group are in the
formative stages (ask for Pat
at the Gathering for more
information).

We welcome all of our
sisters to come for a short
visit, a long stay, or a lifetime.
There's a lot going on here and
a lot of beautiful sisters
struggling to make it happen.
In addition, Santa Fe itself is a
lovely place, surrounded by
rainbow deserts and high
mountain ranges. So please
come when you can. You will
be welcome!

Much love and energy;
Pat Aspen

Albuquerque Woman Shares Feelings on Monogamy

Dear T-,

Entering into this letter has
been most trying. My mind
goes into spasms of thought
leaving me too tired to write it
down, and usually goes too
fast for me to stop it long
enough to communicate it.

I am alone for the first time
in a while. I try not to think of
it as a long time, because I
have a feeling only loneliness
knows how long time can be.
Being alone isn’t as frighten-
ing as it once was. As I have
gotten older I have developed
a few distractions that really
work, but it is more a
confusing situation than any-
thing else. Confusing for its
blatant simplicity. In most
everything else there are at
least two sides to reason out,
why, where, etc., when I am
by myself, there is nothing to
figure out - I am. I might
question do I want to be by
myself, but then I am
confronted with the thought
that maybe I have something
to learn through it. Of course
that seems most logical, but I
guess my energies feel at an
incredible stalemate. The pro-
verbial question ‘why’ is
replaced by ‘what’ a seemingly
healthier question but equally
frustrating.

We are certainly living
through one of the most
difficult periods of evolution
our species has ever encoun-
tered. It sometimes seems that
through all our genius we have
figured ourselves out to be
extinct. No longer do we have
immediate goals to be fulfilled
ritually, filially, maritally, etc.
We are here as free beings to
note our essences, but to do
what with them?

When I think specifically
about our relationships with
one another, our honest
efforts in trying to figure out
our needs and desires, when I
then think about sexual
monogamy, celibacy, polyg-
amy, I become wary about
what we are really doing.
There seems to be a total
awareness between two peo-
ple when they first begin to
learn about each other, of
each other. There are two
living patterns of ideas,
feelings, attitudes, that, for
whatever reasons, try to
merge, move together, not
necessarily compromise
themselves but rather learn to
peacefully co-exist with each
other. All of this takes time,
weeks, months, years, but
when those people have
achieved an understanding
with each other, there is a
time of respite and almost a
honeymoon of sharing and
knowing; but then after that,
what?

It seems that what happens
is that the result has been one
finding someone else to be
alone with, depending upon
what those individuals want.
It can be a time of incredible
creativity or it can be a time of
frustration. That is where
monogamy sometimes ends
and the cycle begins anew,
flavored slightly with either
the original two not being with
each other, or both trying to
maintain the peacefulness
they've found with each other,
as well as attempting to
expand it with others.

The way I have seen and
experienced the latter has
meant an incredible amount of
pain with the results being
shattering. I am going through
it now and feel angry about
the waste of energy and
denial. I guess what I believe
is that the only time we can
honestly deal with a polyga-
mous situation is only after we
are sure that we can live with
ourselves first, and one other
happily, only then do we know
honestly what we are expand-
ing. Polygamy as it happens
now is just another way for us
to be distracted from whom
we are, in my opinion a
dangerous distraction.

With love and strength and
smiles......

We Got Your Number...

In July, Big Mama Rag, who has been a member of the Denver
Sustaining Fund since that group's inception, approached the
fund with her first request ever for funding. Through the events

that followed, we found the DSF not to be radical (going to the 

roots) in its analysis of society, economics or its own functioning.
Rather, it is a reformist group whose interest is in wresting power
from that part of the system presently in control, in order to hold it
for another party of that same system, Patriarchy. The age-old
struggle of the sons against the fathers; both against the women.

As requests for funding by various groups were reviewed, it
became apparent that decision-making was based more on politics
than on need. Our politics did not fit the “radical” mold. Another
version of Animal Farm. The “radicals” have a stake, become the
reformists, become the capitalists. To wit: The “boys on the Left”
(a term borrowed from Robin Morgan) were more concerned with
whether BMR could show a profit (this information was not
sought from other groups applying) than with whether BMR would
continue to exist in this community, without DSF support. BMR
tried to point out that our purpose for existing is an evolutionary
Feminist revolution — not the amassing of money. We are
concerned with communication, not profits.

While some 50 women, representing individuals and women’s
groups with memberships of close to 1000, turned out to show the
need for and support of a women’s paper in Denver, some DSF
members questioned our base of support in the community! It's
apparent the DSF sought evidence of our support not from among
the people, not from among the women's community, but from
within its own narrow vision. Once again, the definition of reality
was that which is male-dominated and controlled.

Because the women of this community asserted themselves
and sought to influence the DSF, they were labeled Mau-Mau, both
by a member of the Tenant's Union and later by the Straight Creek
Journal. Interesting. That people supposedly dedicated to the
elimination of oppression—sexist, racist, or political—used a
term designating a Black uprising (one that should have a positive
connotation) as a put-down. It can be so only if one is in
allegiance with the system whose foundations are being
challenged.

Dealing with such bigotry is a waste of our time and a
dissipation of our energies. “We will not attempt reform of our
oppressors while women are in such need. All women. We are
telling you, yes, there are working women here, yes there are
Lesbians, yes, there are heterosexuals, yes, there are children,
yes, there are Blacks and Chicanas, yes, there are differences in
our oppression, but we are all oppressed first because we are
women, and we know it. Yes, we are looking to our own
oppression. And yes, we've got your number: a revolution which
ignores the needs of women will produce a society which ignores
the needs of women. The freedom of women is a world to be
fought for.

RAPE
Denver Doing Enough?

Rape will always exist in a patriarchal society. It keeps a woman
in her place, both physically and mentally, by making her afraid to
act as an individual. It reinforces marriage and encourages women
to seek men as protectors. Even when a rapist has been caught,
convicted, and sentenced, a woman is still not free to move in this
society. She is still seen as property.

Women are subject to the violent abuse of their bodies and are
denied humane treatment and the equal protection of the law
every day in this city. Although the incidence of rape has
drastically increased in recent years, causing some to refer to
Denver as the “rape capital of the world,” the conviction rate for
rape remains lower than for any other crime.

The rapist mentality permeates the police, the courts and the
medical profession by forcing the victim to prove that a crime has
even taken place! She must also fit the stereotypical female role
that is determined by this patriarchy in order for her to be worthy
of the “protection” of sexist laws. It is no wonder that women
often refuse to report this crime. The socialization of women
demands that women be dependent, passive, submissive -
characteristics that invite the hostility of the rapist - and then
women are criticized for not being independent, strong and active in
reporting and prosecuting their rapists. Another example of the
insensitive, schizophrenic male mentality that runs this city.

Rape hotlines in Denver provide support for a victim after she
has been attacked and discovers that her life has been drastically
altered by the experience. They offer preventive education,
lobbying, and speakers for citizens groups. But they are funded by
federal anti-crime money and basically present no threat to the
system that they actually claim to oppose.

Police Paternalism

The police department has proven that it cannot or will not act
to effectively limit this crime. This is understandable since the
police department is a male institution. Men basically view
society as being composed of the criminal and the citizen, the
good and the bad, the good will conform and the bad will not. A

POLICY STATEMENT:

LNS

“She has taken a woman lover
whatever shall we do

she has taken a woman lover
how lucky it wasn’t you” 

Gossip is one of our worst enemies. And hard to counter. But
“political criticism” — now that’s something concrete and direct
that we can handle. The episode we're referring to happened at the
July 10 meeting of the Denver Sustaining Fund (See p. ) when a
member of the Radical Information Project stated that RIP
believes that working class women do not want to relate to BMR
because of the paper’s history of “Radical Lesbianism.”

Someone finally said it out loud. Lesbianism. BMR is pleased
to take the opportunity to confront controversy head-on and stop
gossip by telling the truth. We believe this is so important that we
have decided collectively that this article would be our “policy
statement” on the subject, endorsed by the women of Big Mama
Rag — united.

To clear the air. Many responsible positions on the BMR staff
are held by women who identify themselves as Lesbians; the
collective itself is made of women, less than 50% of whom are
Lesbians. This is not a confession; it is an affirmation. BMR has
dealt internally with this issue, and continues to do so, in an
atmosphere of respect and trust. BMR recognizes that Lesbians
are women who have affirmed a primary commitment to women,
and as such, deserve a place of respect among women. We also
recognize that at least 10% of women are Lesbians, and that our
newspaper should reflect that fact. It seems that the community's
own homophobia (fear of homosexuality) has allowed it to judge
BMR on the basis of one issue of our paper (May 74) in which we

An Open Letter to the Women’s Movement

ED. Note: The following open letter to the Women's movement concerns a lawsuit which was brought against Robin Morgan, Random House, and Vintage Books by Lucinda Cisler because of allegations that her bibliography was plagiarized in Sisterhood is Powerful. This lawsuit is depleting the money in the Sisterhood fund which ordinarily goes to women’s groups. At the beginning of this month Big Mama Rag attempted to contact Ms. Cisler by writing to her and asking if she wished to tell us about her side of the story before we published any of the criticism concerning her action. She did not respond and so we can only print one

Sisterhood, we say, is powerful. It is springtime, and while the male politics of the sixties grow less relevant in their rhetoric to people’s lives, women move on. This is a period of rapid expansion and outreach for the Women’s Movement as Feminism finds form in new health centers, community women’s centers, women’s studies programs, rape crisis lines, and similar projects which are opening and thriving in every city in the country. As we resurrect/create a female culture, so we find ourselves continuing to walk the tightrope above a crevice of self-destruction. We live constantly with the internal threat of that “woman-hating” characteristic to which we all are socialized, infecting and ultimately destroying all we are trying to build. The often vicious internecine warfare of the Women's Movement is still a present enemy.

But SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL; it is our strength; it is the title of an anthology that introduced thousands of women to the Women’s Movement; it is a Fund—or rather, it was a Fund. It was an access to money for women’s projects supported by all the royalties from the book Sisterhood is Powerful. The Fund was established by Robin Morgan, who compiled and edited the anthology, to provide financial support for Feminist projects and actions. There are women who have grown rich on the movement. Robin Morgan is not one of them. Rather than profiteering from Feminism, she gave an effective example of real sisterhood in creating the Fund.

It was the first such Feminist “foundation,” and for four years it has given money to a wide spectrum of women's groups. Many of you reading this will know from first-hand experience that funding has gone to women’s centers and health projects, newspapers and anti-rape groups, Lesbian groups, welfare mothers, women’s cultural projects, third world Feminist groups, abortion campaigns, and more. The book royalties to date have approximated $40,000, yes, forty thousand dollars. And there has been no male-style “politicking” in the form of dissemination—groups requested funds, and the checks went out.

Only one example: Two years ago, when the Los Angeles Feminist Self-Help Health Clinic was busted, the Sisterhood Fund sent $2,000 for their legal defense. But two months ago, when three midwives of the Santa Cruz Birth Center were busted also for “practicing medicine without a license”—which will mean a heavy court case challenging the California law against midwifery and the concept of childbirth as a disease—the Sisterhood Fund could do nothing. Because the Fund is being destroyed through a lawsuit brought by a woman, Lucinda Cisler.

Contending that the bibliography at the back of Sisterhood Is Powerful was plagiarized from her “Women: A Bibliography,” Cisler is suing Robin Morgan, Random House, and Vintage Books for a minimum of $300,000. (One might ask: Will she turn it back to the Movement as Robin Morgan did the royalties? But then, again, who ever heard of plagiarizing a bibliography? Many women all over the country compiled bibliographies before or at the same time Cisler did. Similarities in all these bibliographies abound, as anyone doing research in Women's Studies well knows—so the question is really rhetorical.) In addition, Cisler is attempting to get an injunction to stop the printing of Sisterhood is Powerful. The standard book contract requires that all legal fees in such a suit against the publisher are to be absorbed from royalties. Morgan and the fund are powerless to stop this. So, while women in Santa Cruz are fighting to survive the man’s courts, the lawyers hired by Random House are depleting our fund at the rate of approximately one hundred dollars an hour because Cisler is suing.

Robin Morgan, when first faced with the suit, offered Lucinda Cisler the opportunity to settle this within the Women’s Movement, by the establishment of a Feminist court, or by Feminist mediation. But seeking to play a male game by male rules on male turf and with a male lawyer, Cisler proceeded on her original course.

As a result, legal fees for the suit have presently depleted the fund until at least 1976, and if Cisler persists into court the fees will destroy the Fund utterly. And, if Cisler is successful in stopping the printing of Sisterhood is Powerful, the book, a substantive part of the literature of our new and growing culture and a basic women's studies text will go out of print.

Some large questions beg to be answered:

Why?

Why did Cisler wait four years to take this action?

Why did she never approach Morgan personally?

How on earth is it possible to plagiarize a bibliography?

Why is such an apparently futile action being taken when its only effect can be to destroy part of us—the Women’s Movement?

If sisterhood is powerful it must be beyond self-destructiveness. If this case cannot be terminated very soon, the fund is not merely depleted for two years but destroyed permanently, a valuable book will be lost, and another sister will have been taken to the stake by one who claimed to be our own.

We have written this open letter for two reasons: We thought the Women's Movement has had a right to know what is happening with our sister, our book, and our fund. We would also welcome support, including any ideas or statements of solidarity. They can be sent to: Kathy Barry, 2327 J Street, Sacramento, California 95816.

It’s a long way from the self- and sister-lacerating realities of today, to our Feminist vision. But Sisterhood can be powerful, if we dare make it so.

NWPC Cont. Evokes Response

Libby Denham

The events of the National Women’s Political Caucus conference held June 27-29 in Wichita, Kan., brought strongly to mind a Happening at a Michigan college I once attended.

In both instances, the depth of understanding of each participant was the measure of the benefit received. The good listener at the conference must have deepened her awareness of the female plight and some of the ways to alleviate it. The good speaker would have enjoyed the satisfaction of having influenced the thinking of a group.

At a national conference, such as this, no legislation can be enacted but some 600 delegates can, and did, express themselves in all the areas of the struggle for women's rights.

The ordinary functions of sleeping, eating and drinking were temporarily suspended as participants attended workshops designed to “awaken, organize and assert” women's political power, responded to intense discussions of Feminist issues from sisters from all over the country and then heard the broader issues of Women’s Liberation defined anew by Congresswoman Bella Abzug, Ms. Editor Gloria Steinem and others. A lot of mileage can be gotten from hot baths instead of hot dinners, cheese, crackers and coffee cake.

In the worst tradition of group action, the present financial plight of the National Caucus was left unresolved, unless a miraculous generosity develops among state caucuses — and soon. The national body says it should have 60 percent of its budget financed by membership dues — and suggests at least $10 per member. A determined group of “grass rooters” wants the organization to continue to distribute its political expertise for only $1 per member, citing benefits of broader membership. NWPC has been able to pay only salaries and postage for the past two months.

The better aspects of group function, I thought, were demonstrated on the day of the shooting of Mrs. Martin Luther King Sr. on the last morning of the meetings.

Chairman Sissy Farenthold made the announcement at the plenary session. The full details of the tragedy were not known and most assumed the civil rights leader's mother had also been a victim of a racially-motivated radical.

An adjournment was announced while a Caucus formed to prepare an expression of sympathy. Consensus was hampered by the earnest desire of one member to make specific reference to racially-motivated violence.

After time for discussion of this point ran out, the objecting member was given responsibility to present the statement expressing sympathy and stressing racial violence to the whole assembly. At this stage she was

The longest day of the year. That's what June 21 was.  
Summer Solstice. From sol - the sun, and sistere - to cause to  
stand still. And sisters from Albuquerque, Tucson, Denver, Min-  
nesota, Missouri, New York and various locations in between kept  
arriving throughout that long day, celebrating the solstice. Mak-  
ing that weekend stand still in a peaceful out-of-the-way camp-  
ing area in New Mexico.

A place marked with pine trees and swimming holes,  
streams, water fountains here and there, campfires, children, two  
hundred women with their hands joined singing: “We are one  
in the spirit, we are one in the soul, and we know that unity will  
some day unfold, and we know we are sisters by our love.” The  
sounds of women telling fortunes, reading poems to each other,  
the freedom of women together - in various stages of dress and  
undress and body paint and bare skin. The seeds of a world some-  
day guided by the power and love of women.

On the evening of the Solstice there was music and  
dancing until the sun set. Maureen shaking the tambourine. Judy  
and Sharon strumming homemade bass drums, fashioned from  
wash tubs and rope and broom handles. Gail plucking a banjo.  
Congo drums of bone and hide. Guitars, whoops. Shouts.

Chants. Dancing in circles. Dancing hand-in-hand. Alone or to-  
gether, hugging the earth with our feet and our bodies. Not the

kind of music you'd see in a bar, but dancing that came from some  
place deep inside each woman's soul. Fishtailing, spiraling out-  
ward, sketching patterns on the sky with arms and hips and knees  
moving back and forth steadily - slow or fast but always in time  
with the music each woman heard herself.

Strong Amazon voices, singing the songs that tell  
the story of woman. Sharing our evening meals together. Bathing  
together in the small pool under the waterfall. Tai Chi, movement,  
Yoga, massage. Women with their speculums, seeing their  
cervixes for the first time. ""Smile if you're a Lesbian.”

A peyote ceremony underneath the pine trees.  
Psychic Feminism; feeling in tune with the Great Goddess  
and with our Indian sisters who once roamed the ground where  
we stayed. Attempting to call down our sisters in outer space,  
sighting their spaceships. Talk of the matriarchy and of its return,  
of parthenogenesis, of Amazon culture.

Feminist astrology, learning about herbs for our own  
health. Walking arm in arm. No one can walk up to each other  
without hugging, smiling, laughing. Happiness is contagious!

Women together without men can do anything,  
‘Amazon nation here in the mountains. If only for a short while.  
A precursor of what is to come!

BMR CLASSIC REPRINT

Resistance to CR

Irene Peslikis

Thinking that our man is the exception and, therefore, we are the exception among women.

Thinking that individual solutions are possible, that we don't need solidarity and a revolution for our liberation.

Thinking that Women's Liberation is therapy. This, whether or not you belong to the organization, implies that you and others can find individual solutions to problems, for this is the function of therapy. Furthermore, the statement expresses anti-woman sentiment by implying that when women get together to study and analyze their own experience it means they are sick, but when Chinese peasants or Guatemalan guerillas get together and use the identical method they are revolutionary.

Thinking that some women are smart and some women are dumb. This prevents those women who think they're smart and those women who think they're dumb from talking to each other and uniting against a common oppressor.

Thinking that because we have an education privilege and can talk in abstracts we are somehow exempt from feeling oppression directly and talking about it honestly and, therefore, think of personal experience as something low on the ladder of values (class values).

Thinking that women consent to their own oppression (or that anyone does for that matter). This is a statement which puts the blame on the oppressed group rather than on the oppressor class which ultimately uses brute force to keep the oppressed where they are. It is an anti-women and anti-people statement.

Thinking that only institutions oppress women as opposed to other people. This implies that you have not identified your enemy, for institutions are only a tool of the oppressor. When the oppressor is stopped he can no longer maintain his tools and they are rendered useless. Present institutions and our feelings about them should be analyzed in order to understand what it is we want or don't want to use in the new society.

Thinking in terms of them and us. This implies that you are setting yourself off or apart from women (the people). In doing this you neglect to recognize your own oppression and your common interests with other people, as well as your stake in revolution.

Thinking that male supremacy is only a psychological privilege with “ego” benefits as opposed to a class privilege with sexual and economic benefits. The former implies a considerable amount of individual variation among men, therefore permitting you to find an individual solution to the problem.

Thinking that the relationships among men and women are already equal and thus immersing yourself in utopian fantasies of free love in spite of the fact that the objective conditions deny it. Love between men and women, free or unfree, is millennial, not real, and if we want it we will have to struggle for it.

Thinking you can educate the people. This implies that you are educated and you will get a revolution going by teaching other people what you know. Education does not bring on revolutions; but consciousness of our own oppression and struggle might. Unfortunately, formal education and political consciousness do not usually coincide.

Even formal education in Marxism-Leninism tends to make people think that they know more than they really know. When we think of what it is that politicizes people it is not so much books or ideas but experience.

The problem of sexual assault is one which affects us all, whether directly or indirectly, no matter what our age, race, or life-style might be. Sexual assault is not limited to the rape of young women, but includes attacks on infants as well as senior citizens. The following information was collected from various resources. These facts are not pleasant, but it is important that we all become familiar with them.

* Denver now has the highest reported rate of forcible rape in the country (52.1 per 100,000 population — FBI Uniform Crime Report.)

* The majority of victims are single, Anglo females between the ages of 16 and 34 (71% Anglo, 15% Black, 11% Chicano — Denver Anti-Crime Council, The Crime of Rape.)

* There has been a 121% increase in the number of forcible rapes that occurred from 1960 to 1970. In 1970 a forcible rape occurred once every 14 minutes in the United States (FBI Uniform Crime Reports.)

* The true rate of rape may be three to four times higher than police figures show because of the reluctance of many women to report the crime (National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago.)

* Most rapes in Denver are stranger to stranger. In 67.1% of the cases studied between July 1970 and June 1972, the victim and the offender were total strangers to each other (The Crime of Rape in Denver, DACC.)

* According to the DACC report most victims (50.4%) attempted some sort of resistance, the most frequent being physically frightening off the attacker or verbally trying to dissuade him (The Crime of Rape in Denver.)

A Woman's Place

Janet Sergi

Unfortunately, there are two forms of rape: physical rape and mind-rape. These two man-made inventions serve as political terrorism over every woman in this patriarchy. They keep every woman in her place, that is in the shadow of every man.

Physical rape is when any man has intercourse with any woman without her total and free choice. It can and does occur at any time, in any place, by any man, friend, lover, husband, father, neighbor, or stranger.

From early childhood, every girl is socialized to forget herself and serve the interests of all males in her family. This conditioned response of submission of the female to the male sets the stage for physical rape. This background of female submission is the first and most pervasive form of mind-rape. A girl child in the patriarchy has no independent self-definition.

Thus she is the perfect prey for the rapist. She is mind-raped out of a consciousness of self.

So to go one step farther, most acts of sexual intercourse are rape: the submission of the female without free self-consciousness choice. So most men are rapists, and all women are rape victims.

Mind-rape is the permanent violation of our woman soul in the patriarchy. When we walk down the street and think of the danger of physical rape, we may avoid their occurrence, but in the process we are being thoroughly mind-raped. This second form of mind-rape occurs when we spend our psychic energy thinking about men, i.e., the rapist, instead of thinking about our woman soul, or our self-created identity. Mind-rape is the impingement of a male identity on the female consciousness.

Mind-rape is the loss of the freedom to be ourselves. Freedom for women equals our women friends, our art projects, our pets, our children, our lovers, our developing woman's culture, our poetry, and our mother earth. We are the unconscious participants in our own mind-rape when we unthinkingly look to men for our sense of self-worth, or as a source of income, or for protection, or as the only source of sexual intimacy. Mind-rape is the search for male approval.

Here is the precise point where we can begin to stop the patriarchy’s cycle of physical rape and mind-rape. If we stop looking towards men to protect us from their own institution, Physical Rape, we kill two birds with one stone. We take into our hands the task of education and defending ourselves against the traditional rapist on the streets. When we very consciously choose when and whom we make love to -- we stop the cycle of automatic submission to males. When we develop our own culture, we begin the task of undoing the patriarchy. When we create our own self-definitions we begin to define a woman's place.

Our woman vision is of that place where the mental or physical dominance of one sex over the other is unthinkable. In a woman's place, the bodies and souls we are born with will be honored, not violated. In a woman's place, we ourselves will create who and what we are. A woman's place is simply everyone's place."

Itching, scratching, burning... va-

are they physically irritating, but they  
can also cause premature bankruptcy

every time they come up. All the more  
reason to learn to diagnose and cure  
them yourself! The following informa-

the three most serious infections (not  
including syphilis and gonorrhea,  
which are serious!), their diagnosis  
and ways of curing them (both through  
prescribed medicine and so-called  
“home-remedies”).

In order to diagnose your own

items: a speculum (the instrument a  
gynecologist uses to spread open the  
walls of the vagina for a look inside;  
get one through your local self-health  
clinic or through a medical supply  
house), a mirror, a flashlight, some  
clean cotton swabs, a glass slide (or  
you can use the mirror’s surface),  
and... if you really want to get  
technical, you can have a microscope  
on hand.

Taking the speculum in one hand,  
holding the bills closed, and spread-  
ing the lips of the labia with the other,  
slowly insert the bills into the vagina.  
If this is hard or uncomfortable put a  
little K-Y surgical jelly on the blades  
(NOT Vaseline which can alter the  
environment of the vagina and allow  
infections to occur).

Using the Speculum

After the blades are in, turn the  
speculum so that the handle is facing  
up. Now find the thumb press lever  
and push it in and down until you hear  
it click. The speculum will then be  
open. Using the mirror with one hand  
and flashing the light on the mirror  
with the other, so that light is  
reflected into the vagina, you can now  
see the interior of the vagina.

Using one of the cotton swabs,  
scrape off some of the secretion  
inside. By smearing this onto a slide  
or the mirror’s surface, you will be  
able to gauge the texture, color, and  
consistency of the secretion and  
hopefully tell what type of infection  
you have.

Let’s start with a description of what  
normal mucus looks like. Your normal  
discharge will be transparent or  
slightly milky. When it is dry it may  
look yellow. This discharge causes no  
inflammation or irritation and varies in  
amount throughout your cycle. It will  
either have an inoffensive smell or no  
smell at all. The normal vagina is acid  
and contains many types of bacteria  
which keep out harmful germs. If you  
douche too much or use vaginal  
sprays and deodorants, these can  
destroy the bacteria and upset the  
natural balance of the vagina.

Now for the infections. We'll start  
with:  
1. Yeast - fungus, monilia, or candida.

Symptoms: You will find itching  
and inflammation of the vulva and  
outer vagina, which will just about  
drive you nuts! The discharge, when  
spread out on the slide, may be light  
or very heavy and thick like cottage  
cheese and stringy (this is more  
common) and will smell rather yeasty,  
like baking bread. There will be white  
patches of the yeast on the walls of  
the vagina, and if you scrape them off,  
there will be red raw patches  
underneath.  
Treatment: In order to relieve the  
itching on the outside, you can paint  
the whole area with gentian violet. It's  
a mess but it relieves the pain. The  
best and fastest way to get rid of yeast  
is by using Mycostatin suppositories,  
but these can only be obtained with a  
prescription (which means you will  
have to go to a doctor, who will  
probably insist that he check you over  
before he writes the prescription,  
therefore costing you mucho bread). If  
you have any friends who are doctors  
or druggists, have them get it for you.  
The suppositories should be inserted  
in the morning and at night for a full  
ten days to make sure that you  
completely get rid of the infection.  
Other Remedies

There is also a jelly called Propion  
Gel that you can put in once a day with  
an applicator. If the infection is not  
large you can sometimes cure it by  
putting in a tablespoon of plain yogurt  
(the type you can buy at the market). I  
have also heard (although not  
personally tried) that tea douche made  
from two herbs - osha root and golden  
seal - will sometimes completely cure  
a yeast infection. I would be interested  
in hearing from other sisters about  
other herbal remedies.

Circumstances that can make yeast  
infections easier to get:

1. Diabetes - causes sugar in the  
urine and extra carbohydrates in the  
vaginal walls, both of which provide  
good food for the yeast and help it to  
grow.

2. Antibiotics - when used anywhere  
in the body to fight infection, they  
also kill the bacteria in the vagina.

3. Pregnancy, birth control pills,  
bad diet, obesity.

7. Wearing nylon underwear keeps  
the vulval area warm and moist and  
yeast love warmth!

MINNIE WOMAN

In 5th grade the boys went to the gym  
and the girls went to the library  

when the librarian opened the door  

I realized it was the first time  

I'd ever seen her smile  

Woman of white, the school nurse,  
introduced the film we were about to see  
on the facts of life  

which turned out to be a cartoon  

called the “Story of Menstruation”  
starring Minnie Mouse  

The mouse came on, her tail twitching, nervously,  
a 40 piece orchestra accompanied Minnie  

through what she called the “Beautiful Moment”  
and I twitched thinking about my anemia  

‘Everything on the screen was enlarged  

so we could understand it  

but the distortion confused me  

til I wasn’t certain which was the egg  

and which was the kotex.  

I had difficulty with Minnie’s language too  
which made it hard to know where to laugh  
and I tapped my shoes anticipating lunch  
while the mouse told all she knew  

about being a woman  

When it was over the nurse came out again  
and said the egg catchers were available  

in her office:  

never having anything wrong with me  

I'd never been to her office  

She asked if there were any questions  

and it was silent til the bell rang  

-Lallo

A WOMAN WITH ME  

Rain on me with your mouth  
As soft and winning as my favorite Scotch  
I have known you many times before sweet love  
A woman nestled against my arm  
A woman twitching at the cheek for want of  
touching me  
A woman with her legs around me—  
clutched so tight and looking at me with her toes,  
Some small respite from the world of men  
A woman  
Her eyes as bright as sparklers  
Her loves as warm and different as a patchwork quilt  
Let me sew myself into your hair  
Comfort you and listen to our noses pressed together  
They sound like us  
They sound like women  
Together many times  
Before and now and sometime in the future  
She will always be a woman  
With me  
I will always have a woman  
With me

SONGS FOR DELIUS*  

When does blindness have its turn?  
When do eyes used to seeing stretch marks on stomachs  
isolated hairs on nipples  
pick out their benchmarks  
from black landscape  
behind closed eyelids  
and give hurt a chance at its own joy?  
When?  

Tell me about the when?  
It lurked in the corner  
then moved over the edge of today  
holding hands with a hammer in a sea of nails.  
Every time I threaten to play carpenter  
and rebuild tomorrow  
when comes and peeks over the roof  
and through the floor beams.  
Its grimace scares away the ark  
and washes me on shore with no people.  

My self is seeking the event of its birth.  
The fractured egg nebula  
can no longer hide  
in pubic hair  
or inward stare  
I am not too old to learn about the Phoenix.  

The I/me/you/us/them split is healing.  
The salve lies within my own juices  
and I am drinking at my own well  
prefiguring, configuring the celebration:  
a female rite  

which the whole universe is invited to witness.  
And I am writing the songs  

for I have also found my voice  

and will sing to you.

of tone poems.

I want to sing to a bird

In the forest the women come and go

Speaking of them all.  

Speaking of woman, the beginning and end,  
woman, the ever continuing force of life.  

Speaking of Lilith and Cleopatra; the flaming Joan;  
Madame Curie and Lucy Stone.  
Speaking of them all.

Rocking out the phoenix.

The phoenix of life force; all that is feminine.  
Rocking, rocking it out.  

Moving the ashes.

In the forest of the mother,  

In the power of our lives,  

In the fire of the night,  

Wrapped close to death, the wings unfold  
And the phoenix rises,

LEGISLATION

From Page 7

A defendant has the constitutional
right to try to impeach a witness on
specific statements. But the rights of
the defendant would not be affected,
according to Wood. Although Iowa
anticipates a constitutional challenge
on its in-chambers hearings provision
in rape cases, Wood believes that
there is no denial of a defendant's
rights since a judge can move certain
proceedings into chambers anyway.

- Marriage No Excuse -

The third proposal is to redefine the
term “spouse” as it is used in
Colorado’s rape and sexual assault
statutes. The current law denies a
woman the equal protection of rape
and sexual assault laws if the
perpetrator happens to be her husband
and even though she may be living
apart from him.

There have been two suggested
alternative proposals to change this
law. One would simply delete the
words “not his spouse” wherever they
appear in the statutes. This would
make a rape or sexual assault a proper
charge in any case. The other
alternative would define the word
“spouse” in such a way as to exclude
from the definitivity a person living
separate and apart from the perpetra-
tor.

“There is no reason that if someone
marries, they should lose the protec-
tion of the law,” says Wood.

The fourth proposal would allow
evidence into a rape or sexual assault
case that would show a common plan,
scheme, design, motive as with the
rapist who consistently leaves identi-
cal evidence such as fingerprints or
exhibits a common behavior with each
victim. Wood says that by case law in
Colorado it appears to be the general

practice that any criminal
proceedings except rape or sexual
assault, may seek to introduce
evidence linking the defendant to the
case by establishing that, on other
occasions, the defendant acted within
a pattern.

Such evidence may be prejudicial
but it is difficult to understand why it
would be any more prejudicial in rape
cases than in robberies and homicides.
Again, continues Wood, there is no
reason for special treatment for rape
defendants.

Victim Compensation

The fifth proposal provides for
compensation for rape victims. The
state would finance the costs of
emergency and follow-up treatment
for victims of such violent crimes as
rape, assault, homicide and robbery.
Allowable costs would include abor-
tion, pregnancy, childbirth, and
psychiatric treatment. Burial costs for
homicide victims would be covered.

This proposal may be the most
controversial, admits Wood, and will
probably undergo major change in the
legislature. To help reduce the
possibility of fraud, state financial
assistance would be contingent upon
the victim’s cooperation with the
evidence of the bona fides of the
charge. Originally this proposal read
that the victim had to cooperate in the
apprehension and prosecution, if any,
of the alleged offender or offenders. It
was changed due to a suggestion
made by Pam Gleason, a member of
the Colorado Democratic Women’s
Caucus, that women should not be
forced to subject themselves to the
cross-examination tactics currently
being used by defense counsel in
court in order to receive the medical
and psychiatric care that they may
need.

Some discussion of this proposal
both at the District Attorney's office
where the proposals were initially
made public and at a recent meeting of
the Denver Coalition of Sexual Assault
centered around making the convicted
offender work while being held in
prison receiving a decent wage to
reimburse the victim (or the State) for
the expenses resulting from his crime,
and his family while he is in prison
that must often receive welfare while
he is being held.

Ms. Gleason also proposed that the
word “rape” be abolished since rape is
defined by penetration of a penis into
a vagina; it is a crime that applies only
to women as victims and is a sexist
term. Rape is not a sex crime, she
continues, but a hostility crime.
Non-penile penetration is still rape
although it is categorized as deviant
sexual intercourse and is considered a
class 4 felony with a shorter sentence
than rape which is a class 3 felony.
Ms. Gleason feels that any kind of
forced genital contact on either side
constitutes a sexual assault.

The D.A.’s office will support
changing and deleting the word “rape”
from statutes and replacing it with
“sexual assault” with various degrees.
Although it would only be calling a
rose by another name, it would still be
a better name, says Pam Gleason. The
humiliation and trauma connected to
the word rape and aimed at the victim
of the crime would hopefully be
lessened.

This legislation is not in final form,
says Wood. Draft copies of it are being
circulated for recommendations from
anyone who is interested.

duce foreign objects into the uterus
because of the increased possibility of
infection, a doctor prefers to have the
woman wait 42 days to determine if
she is pregnant at which time she
could terminate the pregnancy.

The Legislative Task Force is
working on legislation proposed by
the Denver District Attorney’s office
dealing with the reform or abolition of
particular rape laws. Members of the
coalition are being encouraged to
register as lobbyists with the
Secretary of State either as a member
of the coalition or as a private citizen
to help get the legislation passed in
the next session of the state
legislature.

A purpose of the coalition has been
stated by Dr. Saltzman: “We're not
going to change people and we're not
going to change attitudes. We may get
some minor behavioral changes and
get the support of people in there
without too much resentment.”

ANTI-CRIME COMMISSION -

The Denver Anti-Crime Commission
has funded (through the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administra-
tion - LEAA) the Southeast Denver -
Neighborhood Services Bureau, the
Violence Research Unit at Denver
General and the District Attorney’s
Priority Prosecution Program which
gives that office “added manpower to
do a more thorough investigation of
major crimes including rape and put
more emphasis on rape investigation
than on conviction,” according to
Dave Shepard of the Anti-Crime
Commission.

In-service training for the Denver
Police Department has been funded
but the specific program has not been
completely developed. The purpose of
the training, which will include
community input, will be to (hopefully)
increase the sensitivity of the line
officers to the rape victim and to his
own prejudices about the victims.

The Eastside Action Center and the
Westside Action Center have been
funded for education, know your
neighbor programs and counseling
programs. The emphasis at the
Westside Action Center will be on
victim counseling, according to Sandy
Johnson, a staff member at the Center
located at 1312 Santa Fe Drive.

There is a tentative victim support
program to expand the services of the
Visiting Nurse Service at Denver
General Hospital that has yet to be
funded.

WOMEN AGAINST RAPE

WAR (Women Against Rape) has
been formed as a result of the
self-protection classes for women
offered through the Aurora Police
Department. The present goal of the
group, according to Jackie Mitchell, a
graduate of the class, is to present a
petition concerning legislation on the
treatment for convicted rapists to
state legislators.

The petition demands that rape
statutes be changed from a criminal
status to a mental disorder status.
First offenders, according to Ms.
Mitchell, would be treated until cured.
Offenders who have been convicted
more than once would have to remain
in the facility and receive treatment
commensurate with the offense.

Ms. Mitchell cites the study done by
Menachem Amir published in his book
Patterns in Forcible Rape which
concludes that rape is a common form
of learned behavior and is also a
“mental thing.” So instead of being
put into a prison where the offender
receives practically no treatment
whatsoever and usually comes out
hating women even more than before
he should be treated. Ms. Mitchell
would also like to see the government
stop wasting money on projects
studying the perspiration of the
Aborigine and start spending money
on mental health at places like the
state hospital which is understaffed
and underpaid.

She would like to see the federal
government establish one institution
in the U.S. to handle all rapists in the
country and find out what is causing
rape and cure it.

WAR intends to contact NOW for
their support of the petition and will
be working with the Denver Coalition
on Sexual Assault. WAR will be
gathering signatures for the petition
from August 15 through August 31st at all
major shopping areas and will then
send the signatures and petitions to
every state representative in Colorado.

perts on home security, a rape victim,

SOUTHEAST DENVER

The only victimization program in
Denver is at the Southeast Denver
Neighborhood Services Bureau
(SEDNSB). The bureau is funded
through the Denver Anti-Crime Coun-
cil’s High Impact Program.

The SEDNSB bureau deals primarily
with youthful offenders and youth-
oriented planning for the southeast
area along with offering support and
counseling programs for victims as
well as to provide general public
education and organization for the
prevention of victimization. The
efforts of public education are
directed primarily towards Capitol Hill
since it has the highest crime rate in
the city.

Dr. Katherine Saltzman is the
Victimization Coordinator who has
been instrumental in the formation of
the 24-hour crisis line. “The victim has
been ignored while the offender has
gotten all the attention and funded
programs as a rule up to now.”

According to Mary Stage, also of
SEDNSB, the hotline has a trained
volunteer or a staff counselor
constantly available. “We provide
referrals and have professional psy-
chiatric people available to those who
need help.”

Part of the victimization program
also deals with assaults on senior
citizens. If an elderly woman is
attacked it can literally result in her
death. Broken bones, inability to get
to the store and medical expenses can
drastically change and even ruin a
woman’s life.

Anyone who would like to volunteer
to work at the bureau should call
321-8192.

__Denver Doing Enough? |

From Page 10

A policeman at one of the department's storefronts said that the two
most disgusting crimes to an officer are child molestation and
rape. In both “helpless” people are concerned. It is easy for them
to see the effect of assault on a child, but for a woman to be raped
is something a woman is expected to bear.

If the Denver Police Department would like to improve its image
with the women’s community in Denver they will have to become
aware of their own sexist attitudes towards women. There is a hell
of a difference between what the police say it believes and what it
actually does. There have been reports from rape victims that a
married detective on the Sex Detail has visited them at their
homes on unofficial business - showing up at their front doors
complete with a bottle of wine to discuss some of the heavier
aspects of rape.

If the detail needs some consciousness-raising I suggest that
they attend some groups being organized by this paper, and not
invite themselves to the homes of rape victims.

Women do not need the “protection” of men whether through
law enforcement agencies (defenders of the morals of “good”
women) or through scare tactics for women to stay off the streets
at night or to avoid wearing attractive clothes.

We are not second-class citizens. We will not be clinging,
cringing, terrified females. We will not be degraded because we
are women. We will be free. We are not the property of men that
needs to be protected and revenged. As long as women are treated
as property in this society its institutions will perpetuate this
attitude.

The Coalition
The Coalition on Sexual Assault is rapidly dissipating into a
do-nothing, say-nothing group due to an exodus (purge?) of
women who want to take more radical steps towards dealing with
rape.

It seems that many in the coalition are worried about its
credibility (read: image) in the Denver professional community of
law enforcement and treatment, etc. There are endless ways to
help people change their attitudes towards rape, but the coalition
is working on just a very few.

The reason for a Coalition, it seems, is to provide a point for
different energies, perspectives, ideas to work together for a
common purpose. It is unfair and typically “male” to create a
structure that allows a few at the top to make decisions affecting
the whole “for the good of the company.”

The coalition does not need to support men to get things done.
More could be accomplished if the Coalition would forget about
working in the system exclusively, and think about women, their
positions in this society, and the part rape plays in that
subjugation.

The D.A.

The District Attorney's booklet on rape is slick and reminds all
of its readers that “the best way to protect your body is by using
your head.” What it really says is the best way to remain “unde-
filed” is to stay home behind locked doors, and keep your mind
behind locked doors. Yet statistics indicate there is a 50-50
chance that if you are attacked it will be in your home behind your
locked doors.

Rape isn’t a crime of passion. It is a crime of hate and political
terrorism against women. It is the ultimate manifestation of the
colonization of men over women. Rape is not the isolated behavior
of a few sick men. Psychological profiles indicate that the typical
rapist is the boy next door. Rape will exist until our bodies are
truly our own, until men cannot claim to own women.

Lesbian Baiting!

From Page 10

exceeded 10% coverage of the subject. (The actual percentage of
that issue touching on the topic of Lesbianism was only 28%!)
Frankly, this reminds us of labor union history during which any
“communist” content in a paper immediately labelled the paper an
organ of the “international communist conspiracy,” and subjected
it to emotional red-baiting. Radicals, especially, should know
better than to attempt “Lesbian-baiting” in this community.

Does BMR relate to working class women and their concerns?
We have considered this question ourselves. The last issue of
BMR contained two lead stories: “Chicanas Fight Welfare
Injustices,” “Minority Task Force on Prisons,” as well as a
reporting of the conference of Coalition of Labor Union Women,
and an editorial on the Talmadge Amendment (regarding welfare).
The July issue also contained poetry, TV reviews, theory, etc.,
which are of interest to any women. We think it is patronizing to
assume that working class women aren’t interested in anything
but “bread and butter” issues.

Does the Lesbian content of BMR alienate working class
women? It may alienate some. It may attract others. The point is
that sexism is as rampant in the working class as it is in the ruling
class, and that no Feminist paper will ignore or cater to people’s
prejudice against Lesbians, in order to attract more readership.
We have said goodbye to the dishonesty of hiding our personal
and political lives to “organize the people.” We want a newspaper
which will attract a large number of women because it has
something to offer them.

People read the daily papers because those papers offer
information and services, even though readers may not agree with
the paper's editorial policy. It is the nature of editorials to be
controversial, but we do not insist that our readers’ politics align
with ours. We will continue to express our opinions and analysis in
the paper without compromise.

We assume that our readership has the intelligence and
open-mindedness to distinguish opinions from reporting, and we
are working towards making that distinction clearer. We will
continue to report and comment on topics concerning women —
health, education, sexuality, children, self-defense, Lesbianism,
and any other subject that women in this community care about.

Enough said. We take our work seriously. Let's get on with it.

change... that's what we try to
do and that's the thing we
think about... but right now,
most of the things we do are,
as you put it, designed not to
offend because when you
offend somebody, you've lost
them right there, we feel, and
if you don’t offend them, then
you have a chance to get in
there and tell them your side
of the story.

BMR: What is your ultimate
goal for yourselves or your
music? What would you like to
see happen?

SYLVIA: I personally would
like to see the stuff that we
write be out front.

SHARON: That is our ulti-
mate thing... to get our own
music across to people with a
message... you were talking
about the Feminist thing and I
want to make one thing
perfectly clear. What I want to
do is to make it as a woman
and to be an example for other
women to be able to do the
same thing I did - without
having to sell themselves as a
woman... because like they
(Sylvia and Bev) said, it was
an advantage at one time...
you know, I was there up front
playing the tambourine, smil-
ing at people and singing one
me I wasn't conscious of
d mie to be an “example for
women to be proud of, to feel
good about... to raise up their
heads and see that it can be
done, but in a way that you
don't have to sell yourself as a
woman.

Because the majority of the
music B.S. Sugar & Co. has
written is not yet legally
protected, it is not being
performed as part of their act.
One song, Leave My Children
Alone, makes a strong state-
ment, calling for individual
freedom from cultural stereo-
types:

“Leave my children alone.
Let 'em grow now.

Leave my children alone.
Don't try to change them into
your OWN ways,

Leave my children alone.

The content of this interview
has been necessarily abridged
because of space limitations.
Nothing, however, has been
taken out of context.

B.S. Sugar & Co. is appearing
through Aug. 31st at Christo-
pher’s in the Capital Plaza Inn,
Denver.

Caldwell Speaks Out on Rape

The opinions expressed here are those
of Ann Caldwell, not those of the
Minority Hotline or the Coalition on
Sexual Assault, both of which Ms.
Caldwell is a member.

Minority women don't get such a
good shake from the police. There is a
cavalier attitude toward a rape report
from a minority, which is part of the
mass mental block that minority
people are promiscuous.

There is no privacy in reporting a
rape downtown. Snide comments are
made. The attitude of a detective on
the Sex Assault Detail is that it’s
always the woman’s fault.

There was a string of rapes reported
in my neighborhood. The rapist had
the same habit in every assault. The
police didn’t put any special patrol
cars or anything to try to catch this
guy, so the husbands in the area had to
take off work and form a vigilante
committee to catch him. Well - that’s
what it took for the police to do
something. They finally caught a 17
year old boy in the act. But he was a
juvenile, so who knows what happened
to him? He’s probably out on the
streets again.

If a woman is a prostitute, that is still
her own body. It’s hard to get that
through to the police. The hotline at
High Street gets calls from women
who really need to talk to someone.
Often their husbands cause such
problems for them that I don’t see how
they can stand it. A husband often

so she can't leave the house. The
woman is blamed for the rape. The
husband’s attitude is that you must
have done something to cause it. But
this is bullshit. Old women get raped,
young children get raped. In the whole
structure of this society, women are
put down, treated like sex objects. The
rapist degrades a woman to such a
point that he may murder her.

Minority women have unique
problems that women who are in NOW
(National Organization for Women)
don’t have. But there are at least some
minority women represented in rape
action groups.

Some people see the rape problem
in terms of supply and demand. They
say that there would be no rape
problem if there were a red light
district for prostitutes. But the rapist
doesn’t pay a woman he assaults. He
wouldn’t go within a thousand miles
of a prostitute. He gets a kick out of
raping.

I hope I haven't stepped on
anybody's toes and if I have, to hell
with it. I stay up at night mad when
everyone else is sleeping.

Rape Research

Dr. Carolyn Hursch is a co-director
of a research project at the Violence
Research Unit, a division of Psychiatric
Services at Denver General
Hospital. The project is gathering
interviews of women who have been
raped and of women who have
successfully resisted sexual assault.

The interview is completely confi-
dential. A woman may use an
assumed name or just an initial. The
experience of any woman, no matter
how long ago it was that she was
attacked, is needed for the research.
The assault “isn’t something that a
woman forgets. Sometimes it’s easier
to talk as time passes,” says Dr.
Hursch.

A woman need not have reported her

rape to take part in an interview. This
research, when completed, will
hopefully provide a means toward
victim support, offender evaluation
and treatment. It may reveal more
successful means of resisting a rape
and show approaches of rapists.

Dr. Hursch is critical of the Denver
Police Department: “there is not as
comprehensive a preventive approach
as other cities have with rape.
Policewomen are not used as decoys.
The Police Department is not going
out after the problem.”

Any woman who would like to take
part in the research can call 623-8252.

“You Can't Stop NOW!”
14th Conf. Held in Texas

National Public Information
Office, NOW -- Proving the
theme, “You Can’t Stop
NOW!”, the women and men
attending NOW’s 1974 Na-
tional Conference initiated a
dynamic and far-reaching
program for the coming year.
Innovative strategies were
planned in such areas as
employment, marriage and
the family, women’s right to
choose, women in sports, and
international Feminism.
Combatting employment
discrimination was designated
as a high priority for the
coming year, with plans to
focus activities on large
corporations and on compli-
ance agencies which do not
fulfill their mandate. NOW
plans to take action both
nationally and locally against
Sears, which is a major
offender in failing to meet
equal employment opportuni-
ty standards for women.
NOW also made plans to
design and support legislation
which would guarantee home-
makers an income and social
security benefits. In addition,
the organization plans to
develop educational programs
to raise public consciousness
concerning the varying role
and skills of the homemaker.
Emphasizing women’s right
to reproductive choice and
control of their own bodies,

NOW resolved to oppose any
anti-abortion amendments to
the Constitution, stating that
“denial of a woman's right to
abortion is a religious, philo-
sophical, and, more impor-
tantly, a spiritual issue, and
not a political issue.” “With
determined opponents of
women’s rights such as the
Ku Klux Klan, John Birch
Society, Young Americans for
Freedom and Right to Lifers”
named as targets, NOW
affirmed its plans to monitor
both locally and nationally the
activities of these organiza-
tions.

In response to almost daily
requests for information from
all parts of the world, NOW
authorized affiliation with
viable international units and
made plans to adopt suggested
international by-laws and
encourage the convening of
new international affiliates.
NOW will apply for non-gov-
ernmental organization (NGO)
consultative status with the
United Nations, providing
many channels in the UN
through which NOW repre-
sentatives can offer the
feminist viewpoint and urge
concerted action.

Book Reviews

Trilogy. Diane Wakoski.
Doubleday. $2.95.
Janet McReynolds

This is a reissue of the first
three volumes of Diane
Wakoski’s poems, which have
previously been unavailable
except on the rare book
market, with an extremely
useful introduction by the
author. The collection, con-
sisting of Coins & Coffins,
Discrepancies and Apparitions
and The George Washington
Poems offer valuable
insights into the poet's later
work, as well as being a trip in
themselves.

Diane has always been
conscious of her position as a
female in a man's world. A
feeling of displacement and
alienation permeates these
poems. Unlike Adrienne Rich
and Anne Sexton, who both
seem at home in the feminine
side of their psyches, Diane
seems caught in a perpetual
conflict between the feminine
and masculine sides of her
mind, unsure of her own
identity and uncomfortable in
a world which insists on
treating her like a stranger.
She is inventing herself. Her
poems are an attempt to
construct a personal myth
which reacts to the dominant
patriarchal myth of our cul-
ture, at times complying with
it, at other times contradicting
it.

The dramatic poems take
the form of an extended
dialogue with a male who is
brother, father, or lover. The
brother, significantly,
committed suicide and ap-
pears in the poems as an
animus figure. The lover
poems are the most painful,
being filled with images of
dismemberment, fragmenta-
tion, and death of the ego. Again
and again she hurls her
identity against the “other,”
experiencing the sense of
loneliness and abandonment
which is a common feature of
love relationships in our
society. One of the poems
comments:

A realization of difference
came,

and comes and comes and
comes.

When will I find a lover

who is not a blizzard of
slashed feelings?

The George Washington
poems are an examination of
the failure of patriarchal
society, the world of fact that
depersonalizes both men and
women, leaving them es-
tranged from their own feel-
ings. George Washington as a
symbol is a surrogate for her
personal father, who aban-
doned her when she was quite
small. In “The Father of My
Country” she says: my father
made me what I am,/ a lonely
woman,/ without a purpose,
just as I was/ a lonely child /
without any father.”

George Washington is also
metal, currency, agriculture,
the flatness of fact. In
“George Washington: The
Whole Man” she tests the
symbol against the men she
has known, illustrating her
premise that “somehow we
have all been swamped by
history and bamboozled a bit;
that its elegance is also an
absurdity. That our feelings
which we honor, simply
because we have them, are
also mundane and foolish.”
“Trilogy” read as one long
poem, becomes a spiritual
autobiography, an extended
dialogue with the world, in
which the poet, with no
guidelines except her own
feelings, is continually reject-
ing false images, readjusting
her vision, seeing the same
experience over and over, as if
multiplicity must eventually
render up all possible truths.

Sexual Honesty
edited by Shere Hite
Warner Paperback $1.50

Donna Good

During summer my time for
reading increases sevenfold
and in the past month I've
outdone myself, reading al-
most everything I'd put aside
all winter. Of all that I’ve read,
two books stand out in my
mind so much that I feel an
almost evangelistic urge to
tell you about them.

The first book goes by the
rather straightforward title,
Sexual Honesty. And that’s
really what it’s all about. Two
years ago a NOW member by
the name of Shere Hite sent
out an incredibly long and
comprehensive sex question-
naire to women all over the
country. She went to a lot of
trouble to make sure she got a
random sample of women
including doctors’ offices, handing it
out freely to any woman met,
and, incredibly, having Oui
magazine publish it.

The book is subtitled, a
book by women, for women,
and is itself simply an
assortment of some of the
answers Shere Hite got in
response to her questions.
Reading the book, I was
depressed and, in turn,
elated. Most of the women
must have spent three or four
hours on their answers with
some of them obviously using
the questionnaire to vent
frustrations. Some of the
women just as obviously,
have used it to talk about a
forbidden subject.

I have never seen a book
which so clearly showed me
the bonds I share with other
women and how very basic
they are to our lives. I think
every woman should be given
a copy of this book on her
twelfth birthday (a new puber-
ty rite) and every man should
be required to read it at
ten-year intervals.

Walk to the End of the World
Suzy McKee Charnas
Ballantine Books $1.25

The other book I would like
to tell you about is a new
science fiction novel by Suzy
McKee Charnas called, Walk
to the End of the World. For
Feminists who love sci-fi this
book is a treasure. Instead of
the usual brilliant, virile,
dominant young fellow who
triumphs over the whims of
space and fate, we have a
whole new world built for us
— a world where the society
of the western world today
has been carried as far as it
can go along the way it now
pursues.

In Walk the atomic war has
come and long gone and a
new world has started to
rebuild itself; a world where
the sexes are completely
separate and women are the
dregs of the society, used for
breeding and total servitude.

Out of these dregs come a
strong female society (under-
ground of course) and from
this society emerges our
heroine — who is not saved by
any deus ex machina; does
not fall in love with the
handsome hero; and does not
give us our typical happy
ending.

22 RAPE

HELP

From Page 18

High Street Community Center is a
neighborhood action program which
has recently instituted a Rape
Awareness and Control Program
through the efforts of Clarence Brisco,
the program director of the community
center. Women from the community
went to Brisco about their assaults
and were reluctant to report them to
the police. He hopes that the program
will encourage women to report rapes
to the police so that rapists can be
taken off the street.

“Women don't want to go through
the traumatic experience of reporting a
rape. We have set up a procedure with
Denver General Hospital that allows
us tentative access to the emergency
room with the victim.”

A woman who lives in the High St.
area would be more likely to call a
northeast Denver phone number to
talk to someone and to get help from
another member of the community
than she would be to call a strange
number. The police have changed, but
the past is still there and it will take
time to get community people to use
community and city-established facil-
ities.”

The Rape Awareness Program is not
in full operation yet because a federal
mini-grant that had been “programati-
cally approved” but has since been
denied due to bureaucratic mishandl-
ing of funding in Washington, D.C.
has slowed down the organization of
the program a bit. “We were only
asking for a measly $6,000,” Brisco
says. The hotline that was to be
financed by this grant has been taken
care of by having a community dance.
When the money raised by the dance
has run out then the center will
sponsor another one.

fund it for a year. This money provides
for two paid staff, no equipment and
no hotline. “We're the only program in
Northeast Denver that deals with rape
- we should have some priority in
funding,” states Brisco.

“Chicanos, Indians, Orientals, Ang-
los and Blacks live in this area. We
don’t turn anyone away who wants to
help,” continues Brisco. “We're sick
and tired of seeing women being raped
and being afraid of reporting because
of fear of the traumatic experience of
going through an investigation. We're
disgusted with the lack of under-

standing of women from their
families.
Ann Caldwell, who is on the

steering committee of the Denver
Coalition on Sexual Assault, and
Judith Nugaris, a psychiatric social
worker, coordinate the Rape Aware-
ness Program. Men are directly
involved in the counseling program to
present a male point of view especially
when a husband rejects his wife who
is a victim.

“There is a reluctance to go to
Denver General because it's a big,
impersonal place,” Ms. Nugaris says.
“The victim is uneasy and I hold hands
a lot. When a woman has been raped
she needs a friend - a nonjudgmental,
noncritical friend who is supportive.
This rape counseling program is
particularly sensitized to minority
people who might be less trusting of
other institutions in the city.”

Any persons who would like to learn
more about the program, would like to
become a volunteer, or have some
input for the program are invited to
attend a Monday night meeting at the
Center at 3401 High Street at 7:30.

SPIRITS RUNWAY

Spirits Runway is a “landing place
for youth"" located at 29th and
Sheridan in west Denver. Jenny
Madrigal, a member of the staff at the
youth center announced that a rape
counseling program has just begun.
“We became aware of the scope of the
problem through the director, Father
Mollison. We went through the
training program at the Southeast
Denver Neighborhood Services Bureau
with Mary Stage. She does a terrific
job. Damn, is she good!

“Now that we have this training we
can work with rape victims. We are the
only center on the west side of Denver
that has this service, even though the
government has other agencies over
here they don’t do anything for a
woman or child who is raped.

“We can’t get any federal funding
for the hotline or any extensive rape
counseling service because we also
advertise that we do spiritual
counseling here and the federal money
agencies don’t like to have that a
public aspect of any program that they
fund.

“Three of us do the counseling now
and the rape counseling hotline will be
open from 10 to 5 on weekdays. The
number is 455-9036.”

The youth center is open for all
people to come to let off steam, talk to
somebody, relax.

TRIAL

The trial of accused rapist Gary
Creed Howell has been reset for
August 19th in Court Room 12 of the
City and County Building. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.

Rape Offenders Treatment Program to Begin

The beginnings of an evaluation and
treatment program for sex offenders is
being instituted by Dr. Harry Chapman
who has recently become a part of the
Violence Research Unit at Denver
General Hospital. Dr. Chapman has
worked on an offenders treatment
program in recent years and now has
had a part of it funded.

An offender can be treated three
distinct ways by the court, according
to Dr. Chapman. After he is
prosecuted and is found to be guilty of
a sex crime he can be sentenced to
Canon City or Buena Vista where he
will receive little if any treatment or
rehabilitation. The second alternative
is for the judge to sentence him under
the Sexual Offenders Act which will
give the convicted offender a sentence
span of one day to life, with the intent
to provide treatment and rehabilita-
tion.

The decision by the judge is made
after an evaluation hearing at which
two psychiatrists and anyone else the
court deems necessary will testify as
to the mental condition of the
offender. The Department of Institu-
tions, not the court, will make the final
decision as to which facility to send

the man if he is sentenced under the

Sex Offenders Act - whether to the
State Hospital or to Buena Vista.

The third way a defendant pleads
not guilty by reason of insanity is that
he is given the psychiatric evaluation
which will determine his sanity. If he
is found insane he will be placed in the
State Hospital until the hospital staff
renders him safe to society and he is
released. Whenever the offender is
deemed “safe” is determined by
whatever process the staff at the
hospital uses for sanity. “We need a
systematic set of evaluation proces-
ses,” says Dr. Chapman.

Dr. Chapman feels that one way to
treat sex offenders is to have half-way
houses in the community where
offenders would live and return to after
holding jobs in the community. “But
no one wants a half-way house in their
community and the offender's behav-
ior needs to be evaluated in the
community. He needs community
experience. The rapist doesn’t fit into
any usual pattern of illness or mental
health. He is not the usual psychiatric
patient.”

He also feels that a possible reason
for this society’s sexual behavior is
that sexual activity is not taught to
children. “Children are taught that a
stove is hot but they are also taught
that it has other good uses - it cooks
food. But there is no teaching of
sexuality. It is not talked about except
in prohibitions. The family doesn't
teach it, the church and school don’t
teach anything good about sex. So
kids learn from peer groups. With
males it is typically self-centered, but
with females it is dealt with more in
terms of seduction: me-thou rather
than being personally centered. Social
mores require that the man is
aggressive and the woman passive.”

In Dr. Chapman's proposal he would
like to set up a program of evaluation
in order to discriminate between
rapists and sex offenders as to just
how dangerous (meaning how likely to
repeat their behavior) they are in order
to provide appropriate treatment.

“We will use clinical interviews of
the family, friends, associates and
psychological test batteries. Men who
volunteer for the evaluation will be
aware that we have a gentleman’s
agreement with the D.A. and the
Public Defender. None of the data can
be used by the defense or the
prosecution in court.

“We would like to provide part of the
overall treatment rehabilitation pro-
grams that would be available to
Canon City State Penitentiary, Buena
Vista Reformatory, or on the streets
with therapy, or in the community
setting for sex offenders. However,
the ultimate jurisdiction is with the
parole board and the courts. If they
decide that a particular offender
shouldn’t be in a program they can
remove him.

“This way there would be some
evaluation prior to release from an
institution and some basis for
assurance of what's going on with the
offender.”

Some possible means of treatment
would be psychodrama, bio-feedback
which is effective in teaching people
how to control certain aspects of their
functions. An offender with poor
impulse control needs to be more
effective in thinking of himself.
Bio-feedback will teach him that he
can control functions that he thinks

are purely automatic. He will learn that

“I want...” is the cue to thinking “I had
better hold back...” Behavior modifi-
cation is another means of treatment
and it is a touchy subject. Dr.
Chapman sees it as putting someone
in control of their own behavior,
because if he doesn’t control it,
somebody else will.

“At this point there is some
research literature on what we're doing
- lots of speculation - at the beginning
stages of this there is enough data to
suggest that the kinds of things we're
doing work. We are just gathering data
at this point. We want to be able to
discriminate among offenders.”"

RAPE: The All-American Crime

From Page 7

when crossing the street. To be
feminine is to wear shoes which make
it difficult to run; skirts which inhibit
one’s stride; underclothes which
inhibit the circulation. Is it not an
intriguing observation that those very
clothes which are thought to be
flattering to the female and attractive
to the male are those which make it
impossible for a woman to defend
herself against aggression?

Women Taught Fear

Each girl as she grows into
womanhood is taught fear. Fear is the
form in which the female internalizes
both chivalry and the double standard.
Since, biologically speaking, women
in fact have the same if not greater
potential for sexual expression as do
men, the woman who is taught that
she must behave differently from a
man must also learn to distrust her
own carnality. She fears herself. This
is the essence of passivity, and of
course, a woman’s passivity is not
simply sexual but functions to cripple
her from self-expression in every area
of her life.

Passivity itself prevents woman
from ever considering her own
potential for self-defense and forces
her to look to men for protection. The
woman is taught fear, but this time
fear of the other; and yet her only
relief from this fear is to seek out the
other. Moreover, the passive woman is
taught to regard herself as impotent,
unable to act, unable even to perceive,
in no way self-sufficient, and, finally,
as the object and not the subject of
a woman is deprived of the status of a
human being. She is not free to be...

If the basic social unit is the
family, in which the woman is a
possession of her husband, the
superstructure of society is a male
hierarchy, in which men dominate
other men (or patriarchal families
dominate other patriarchal families).
And it is no small irony that, while the
very social fabric of our male-dominated
culture denies women equal
access to political, economic and
legal power, the literature, myth and
humor of our culture depicts women
not only as the power behind the
throne, but the real source of the
oppression of men. The religious
version of this fairy tale blames Eve for
both carnality and eating of the tree of
knowledge, at the same time making
her gullible to the obvious devices of a
serpent. Adam, of course, is merely
the trusting victim of love.

Certainly this is a biased story.
But no more biased than the one
television audiences receive today
from the latest slick comedians.
Through a media which is owned by
men, censored by a State dominated
by men, all the evils of this social
system which make a man’s life
unpleasant are blamed upon “the
wife.” The theory is: were it not for the
female who waits and plots to “trap”
the male into marriage, modern man
would be able to achieve Olympian
freedom. She is made the scapegoat
for a system which is in fact run by
men.

White Racist Attitudes

Nowhere is this more clear than
in the white racist use of the concept
of white womanhood. The white
male’s open rape of black women,
coupled with his overwhelming concern
for the chastity and protection of his
wife and daughters, represents an
extreme of sexist and racist hypocrisy.
While on the one hand she was held
up as the standard for purity and
virtue, on the other the Southern white
woman was never asked if she wanted
to be on a pedestal, and in fact any
deviance from the male-defined
standards for white womanhood was
treated severely. (It is a powerful
commentary on American racism that
the historical role of Blacks as slaves,
and thus possessions without power,
has robbed black women of legal and
economic protection through marriage.

It is in this sense that...

Thus black women in Southern
society and in the ghettos of the
North have long been easy game for
white rapists. The fear that black men
would rape white women was, and is,
classic paranoia. Quoting from Ann
Breen’s unpublished study of racism
and sexism in the South “The New
South: White Man's County,” Frederick
Douglass legitimately points out
that, had the black man wished to rape
white women, he had ample oppor-
tunity to do so during the Civil War
when white women, the wives, sisters,
daughters and mothers of the rebels,
were left in the care of Blacks. But yet
not a single act of rape was committed
during this time.

The Ku Klux Klan, who tarred
and feathered black men and lynched
them in the honor of the purity of
white womanhood, also applied tar
and feathers to a Southern white
woman accused of bigamy, which
leads one to suspect that Southern
white men, so much outraged
by a violation of the woman as a
person, in the few instances where
rape was actually committed by black
men, but at the violation of his
property rights. In the situation
where a black man was found to be
having sexual relations with a white
woman, the white woman could
exercise skin privilege, and claim that
she had been raped, in which case the
black man was lynched. But if she did
not claim rape, she herself was
subject to lynching.

Myth of White Womanhood

In construction of the myth of
white womanhood so as to justify the
lynching and oppression of black men
and women, the white male has
created a convenient symbol of his
own power which has resulted in black
hostility toward the white “bitch,”
accompanied by an unreasonable fear
on the part of many white women of
the black rapist. Moreover, it is not
surprising that after being told for two
centuries that he wants to rape white
women, occasionally a black man
does actually commit that act. But it is
crucial to note that the frequency of
this practice is outrageously exaggerated
in the white myths. Ninety
percent of reported rape is intra- not
inter-racial.

In Soul on Ice, Eldridge Cleaver
has described the mixing of a rage
against white power with the
internalized sexism of a black man
raping a white woman. “Somehow I
arrived at the conclusion that, as a
matter of principle, it was of
paramount importance for me to have
an antagonist, ruthless attitude
toward white women... Rape was an
insurrectionary act. It delighted me
that I was defying and trampling upon
the white man’s law, upon his system
of values and that I was defiling his
women--and this point, I believe, was
the most satisfying to me because I
was very resentful over the historical
fact of how the white man has used
the black woman.” Thus a black man
uses white women to take out his rage
against white men. But in fact,
whenever a rape of a white woman by a
black man does take place, it is again
the white man who benefits.

First, the act itself terrorizes the
white woman and makes her more
dependent on the white male for
protection. Then, if the woman
prosecutes her attacker, the white
man is afforded legal opportunity to
exercise over racism. Of course the
knowledge of the rape helps to
perpetuate the two myths which are
beneficial to white male rule--the
bestiality of the black man and the
desirability of white women. Finally,
the white man surely benefits because
he himself is not the object of the
attack--he has been allowed to stay in
power.

Indeed, the existence of rape in
any form is beneficial to the ruling
class of white males. For rape is a
kind of terrorism which severely limits
the freedom of women and makes
women dependent on men. Moreover,
in the act of rape, the rage that one
man may harbor toward another higher
in the male hierarchy can be deflected
toward a female scapegoat. For every
man there is always someone lower on
the social scale on whom he can take
out his aggressions. And that is any
woman alive.

This oppressive attitude towards
women finds its institutionalization in
the traditional family. For it is
assumed that a man “wears the
pants” in his family--he exercises the
option of rule whenever he so
chooses. Not that he makes all the
decisions--clearly women make most
of the day-to-day decisions in a
family. But when a conflict of interest
arises, it is the man’s interest which
will prevail. His work, in itself, is more
powerful. He lords it over his wife in
the same way his boss lords it over
him, so that the very process of
exercising his power becomes as
important an act as obtaining
whatever it is in his power can get for
him.

This notion of power is key to
the male ego in this culture, for the
two acceptable measures of masculinity
are a man’s power over women
and his power over other men. A man
may boast to his friends that “I have 20
men working for me.” It is also
aggrandizement of his ego if he has
the financial power to clothe his wife
in furs and jewels. And, if a man lacks
the wherewithal to acquire such
power, he can always express his rage
through equally masculine activities--
rape and theft. Since male society
defines the female as a possession, it
is not surprising that the felony most
often committed together with rape is
theft. As the following classic tale of
rape points out, the elements of theft,
violence and forced sexual relations
merge into an indistinguishable
whole.

A Woman’s Story

The woman who told this story
was acquainted with the man who
tried to rape her. When the man
learned that she was going to be
staying alone for the weekend, he
began early in the day a polite
campaign to get her to go out with
him. When she continued to refuse his
request, his chivalrous mask dropped
away: “I had locked all the doors
because I was afraid, and I don’t know
how he got in; it was probably
through the screen door. When I woke
up, he was shaking my leg. His eyes
were red, and I knew he had been
drinking or smoking. I thought I would
try to talk my way out of it. He started
by saying that he wanted to sleep with
me, and then he got angrier and
angrier, until he started to say, ‘I want
pussy,’ ‘I want pussy.’ Then, I got
scared and tried to push him away.

That’s when he started to force
himself on me. It was awful. It was the
most humiliating, terrible feeling. He
was forcing my legs apart and ripping
my clothes off. And it was painful. I
did fight him--he was slightly drunk
and I was able to keep him away. I had
taken judo a few years back, but I was
afraid to throw a jab for fear that he'd
kill me. I could see he was getting
more and more violent. I was thinking
wildly of some way to get out of this
alive and then I said to him, ‘Do you
want money? I'll give you money.’ We
had money but I was also thinking that
if I got to the back room I could
telephone the police--as if the police
would even have helped. It was a
stupid thing to think of because
obviously he would follow me. And he
did. When he saw me pick up the
phone, he tried to tie the cord around
my neck. I screamed at him that I did
have the money in another room, that I
was going to call the police because I
was scared, but that I would never tell
anybody what happened. It would be
an absolute secret. He said okay, and I
went to get the money. But when he
got it, all of a sudden he got this crazy
look in his eye and he said to me,
‘Now I’m going to kill you.’ Then I
started saying my prayers. I knew
there was nothing I could do. He
started to hit me--I still wasn’t sure if
he wanted to rape me at this point--or
just to kill me. He was hurting me, but
he hadn't yet gotten me into a
strangle-hold because he was still
drunk and off balance. Somehow he
pushed into the kitchen where I kept
looking at this big knife. But I didn’t
pick it up. Somehow, no matter how
much I hated him at that moment, I
still couldn't imagine putting the knife
into his flesh, and then I was afraid he
would grab it and stick it into me.
Then he was hitting me again and

we fell down the steps and
that’s when he started to strangle me.
He was on top of me. He just went on
and on until finally I lost conscious-
ness. I did scream, though my
screams sounded like whispers to me.
But what happened was that a cab
driver happened by and frightened him
away. The cab driver revived me--I was
out only a minute at the most. And
then I ran across the street and I
grabbed the woman who was our
neighbor and screamed at her, ‘Am I
alive? Am I still alive?’

Threat of Death

Rape is an act of aggression in which
the victim is denied her self-determination. It is an act of violence which, if
not actually followed by beatings or
murder, nevertheless always carries
with it the threat of death. And finally,
rape is a form of mass terrorism, for
the victims of rape are chosen
indiscriminately, but the propagandists
for male supremacy broadcast
that it's women who cause rape by
being unchaste or in the wrong place
at the wrong time--in essence, by
behaving as though they were free.

The threat of rape is used to
deny women unemployment. (In Cali-
fornia, the Berkeley Public Library,
until pushed by the Federal Employ-
ment Practices Commission, refused
to hire female shelvers because of
perverted men in the stacks.) The fear
of rape keeps women off the streets at
night. Keeps women at home. Keeps
women passive and modest for fear
that they be thought provocative.

It is part of human dignity to be
able to defend oneself and women are
learning. Some women have learned
karate; some to shoot guns. And yet
we will not be free until the threat of
rape and the atmosphere of violence is
ended, and to end that the nature of
male behavior must change.

But rape is not an isolated act
that can be rooted out from patriarchy
without ending patriarchy itself. Rape
is a classic act of domination where,
in the words of Kate Millett, “the
emotions of hatred, contempt and the
desire to break or violate personality,”
takes place. This breaking of the
personality characterizes modern life
itself. No simple reforms can
eliminate rape. As the symbolic
expression of the white male
hierarchy, rape is the quintessential
act of our civilization, one which,
Valerie Solanis warns, is in danger of
“humping itself to death.”"

BigMammaRag,3,3,,2,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol3No3_page002.txt,"My name is Mary Louise  
Aragon. On March 4, 1973 I  
was sentenced to the Colora-  
do Women’s Correctional In-  
stitution. My crime was  
aggravated robbery and my  
sentence was indeterminate  
to 10 years. This action ended  
a crime and drug experience  
that had drawn itself out to  
almost ten years of my life.  
On March 6, I was transported  
to CWCI to start paying my  
debt to society.  

My encounters with the law  
by that time had been many  
and I remember thinking how  
degrading and inhumane the  
conditions were in the city  
and county jails. The toilets  
and showers are in plain view,  
giving no privacy at all. Some  
people might say “What the  
Hell?” but when you think  
about it put yourself in that  
position trying to use the  
toilet with a room full of  
people watching your every  
move. So far the conditions  
are minimal compared to what  
a woman is subjected to at the  
prison.  

Upon arriving I was greeted  
by a cold, fenced building that  
was isolated from the town at  
the end of a normal rural  
street lined with typical single  
family wood framed houses.  
The guards all wear white  
uniforms with name tags. The  
name tags show only the last  
name with the initial of their  
first name. That told me that  
they were to be referred to as  
Ms. or Miss or Mrs. Although  
they knew that my name was  
Ms. Aragon they called me  
Mary, which automatically  
tells me that they place  
themselves at a higher posi-  
tion than the inmates. I was  
officially accepted at the  
prison as I signed some  

papers. Up to this point prison  
was just a word to me but now  
I was led through electrically  
controlled doors which  
slammed behind me. From  
that point on I knew I was in  
prison although I can recall  
times when it was comparable  
to a concentration camp or  
even a nursery.  
Prison as Medicine  

Never having been in prison  
before I was somewhat fearful  
of what might happen to me. I  
had heard many stories about  
prison and the physical abuse  
that one might receive while  
being there. But the building  
was fairly new and very clean  
and it was almost like being in  
a hospital. Well to my surprise  
there was very little physical  
abuse. But in its place were  
far more dangerous methods  
of abuse, dehumanization,  
physical and sexual depriva-  
tion, loss of identity, and  
failure of identification.  

My first day in isolation  
(where all new prisoners go)  
was spent in awe of my  
environment. My personal  
feelings at that time were of  
resentment, anger, loneliness,  
fear, and alienation from the  
whole world - and a good deal  
of self-pity. I had never placed  
any emphasis on just being  
able to touch another person  
but during the next two weeks  
the only interaction I had with another  
human being was when I was  
given tests by the doctor, or  
the guard. Often the guard  
would give medication that  
only a qualified nurse was  
supposed to give.  

I reflected a lot on my past  
and my family and I can say  
that at that time I desperately  
needed to talk to someone. I  
really needed a feeling of  

some kind of self-worth. But  
unfortunately there was none.  
So, consequently, by the time  
that I got out of isolation I was  
more than ready to accept any  
member of the prison peer  
group who would at least  
listen to some of my frustrations.  
I needed to tell someone that  
just because I broke the law I  
was still a human being and  
not some kind of an animal to  
be caged up and forgotten.  

As I said earlier, my  
involvement with the criminal  
justice system had been  
extensive, but one of the  
things that has bothered me  
most is that in spite of all the  
classifying, testing, and diag-  
nosing no one ever asked me  
why I did what I did. I guess  
that’s not part of what  
correction is about.  

After two weeks in isolation  
I was given a room in the  
north wing. I was now upper  
north 3 - number 41654. By this time  
my nerves were at a breaking  
point. I spent a lot of time in  
my room which is identical to  
isolation rooms. The only  
differences were a small throw  
rug, bedspread, a small desk  
like table, a closet, and the  
door was only locked from  
10:00 pm to 7:00 am.  

The Rules  

I was given a small book  
which supposedly contained  
rules of the prison. I remem-  
ber thumbing through the  
book and landing on a page  
that said something like no  
moustaches or long side  
burns. Then I realized that the  
book was probably for the  
men’s prison. Then I found the  
page that related to the  
women's institution. The rules  
on that page seemed to be  
relatively simple and per-  
tained mostly to mail, and  

visiting rules.  

But as the days dragged on  
I found that there were many  
unwritten rules that apply to  
some of the people some of  
the time and to some of the  
people all of the time. All in all  
I’d say that there were more  
than 200 of these unwritten  
rules and they are changeable  
on a day to day or shift to shift  
basis. One rule is that you  
can’t have bananas or cucum-  
bers. Another is that you can’t  
go into anyone else’s room at  
all. You can't hold hands with  
visitors. At the men’s visiting  
room they can hold hands.  
Dumb rules that you never  
know if you’re breaking or not,  
but if you do they'll write it up  
and put it in your file and then  
when you come in front of the  
parole board they'll read all  
this “bad girl” stuff and you  
don’t get parole.  

One of the things impressed on  
the women at CWCI is that  
they are ladies and are expected  
to act like ladies. But every day  
I would hear a guard tell a grown  
woman “you know that’s a  
no-no.” Sometimes you would  
get put in lock-up for breaking  
a rule in addition to being  
written up. Lock-up is being  
locked in your room after  
supper and not getting to  
watch TV. I used to get to the  
point where I’d say rules,  
rules, rules, there must be a  
rule for everything in this  
place and if there’s not one,  
believe me, one would be  
made up.  

Stomach Nerve Pills  

Almost all of the women  
take some kind of medication  
there. Of course it’s all  
prescribed legally but is often  
given by a matron who might  
not know what she's doing.  
You almost have to have  
tranquilizers to cope. Living  
there is a constant, constant  
bullshit thing with the same  
people 24 hours a day. You  
worry about your kids. Lots of  
people aren’t the easiest  
people to get along with. A lot  
of vulgarity goes down and  
lots of time you feel like  
hauling off and punching  
someone, but you know if you  
do you'll be put in the hole.  

The hole is underneath the  
isolation area. It's in the  
basement of the basement.  
There are three small cells:  
Two have toilets and matres-  
ses with three solid walls and  
one wall of bars. The third one  
just has a hole in the floor -  
nothing else. No one was ever  
put in there while I was there.  
But I heard that two women  
who tried to escape in 1970, I  
think, were put down there for  
30 days.  

One of the most strictly  
enforced rules there is no  
body contact. YOU CANNOT  
TOUCH ANOTHER PERSON  
FOR ANY REASON. Even  
when you hear that you are  
going to get out or when  
another woman needs to be  
comforted. I'd be told “Mary,  
you know that’s a no-no” they  
treat you like a two-year-old.  
To people on the outside it  
doesn't seem like anything  
not to be allowed to touch  
another person, but for a  
person to feel the impact of  
what I’m saying try going for a  
whole day without touching  
another person or showing  
your feelings physically. And  
then multiply that by months  
or years and you would know  
what a rule like no body  
contact does to you.  

While I was there I worked  
on the yard crew. I got to mow  
the grass and sometimes I’d  
be on this little tractor cutting  
the lawn and I would go crazy  
driving like a nut making hand  
signals. It would help me to  
forget where I was. You know,  
a woman is made up of many  
things and one of the heaviest  
things is emotion. If it is  
suppressed it just surfaces at  
another time.  

The recreation is not very  
good. They have hula-hoops  
and ping-pong tables and you  
can play baseball but there is  
no gym to really let off steam  
and keep yourself in shape  
from the starches you eat. But  
once we really had fun. It was  
on Labor Day when we asked  
to have a picnic in the yard.  
We were going to do all the  
planning and all the work so  
that there would be nothing

Letters Home to Mama

Dear Big Mama Rag:

In your August issue you
reported the story on Big
Mama Rag’s application for
funding with the Denver
Sustaining Fund. You stated:
“We deeply appreciate the
support and help we received
from the many community
women who attended the July
10 meeting of the DSF and
from Kathy DePaulo and Jim
McNulty of the board of
directors of the DSF.” Jim
McNulty was the only one of
the “boys” who supported Big
Mama’s proposal. I would
appreciate it if you would
point out in your next issue
that Jim McNulty is a member
of the Board of Directors of
the DSF as a representative of
the Gay Coalition of Denver.
And on the issue of BMR, he
was specifically urged to vote
for the proposal and to
support it vigorously.

At the previous board
meeting of the Gay Coalition

(a predominantly gay men’s
organization) we unanimously
voted that Jim take the above
course of action at the DSF
meeting. This is based upon
our support of a strong
Women’s Movement in Denver
which we perceive as our
allies in the struggle against
male heterosexual sexism that
oppresses both gays and
women. We understand your
appreciation for Jim individu-
ally, but there is also a gay
organization behind him who
sent him to the meeting with
specific instructions. It is no
coincidence that the only
male support was gay male
support.
Jerry Gerash,
President of the Gay
Coalition of Denver

Dear Sisters;

I just received the August
issue of BMR and would like
to comment on your “policy
statement” regarding Lesbian
baiting.

I think the statement is one
of the most beautiful, sisterly
and strong statements of its
kind that I have ever read
coming out of the women’s
liberation movement — and I
have been around for many
years.

If all women in the
movement felt as you did,
we’d be centuries ahead of
where we are — and we'd be
well on our way. The
statement made my day — no
— it made my week! Right on,
sisters,

in sisterhood,

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Dear Big Mama,

In your July issue, there
was an article about Chicana
welfare rights. I appreciated
your coverage of the concerns
of minority women. It’s
important that we understand
what’s going on with other
women. I think this article, as
well as others in the same
issue, brought some things
home to me that I hadn't
known before.

However, one of the quotes
from Patricia Estrada needs to
be clarified. She said: “Wo-
men who are on welfare are
forced to go to clinics where
the personnel try to convince
them to use birth control
methods to limit the size of
their families. This is simply

preparing the Chicana for
forced sterilization.”

First, I question whether
Ms. Estrada is referring to the
situation in Colorado, or
somewhere else in the coun-
try. If she is describing
incidents in Colorado, she
should back her statements
up with specific examples.
Where are welfare staff per-
sons forcing women to go to
clinics for birth control? At
what clinic are personnel
trying to persuade women to
limit the size of their families?

Because I work in family
planning, I’m concerned about
these accusations. My experi-
ence has been that family
planning personnel go out of
their way not to tell patients
how many children they
should have. I think the
emphasis goes toward helping
a woman decide when she
wants children, rather than
the number she should have.

If women are being bull-
dozed into unhappy choices,
then let’s find out who is
applying the pressure. Unless
women take the responsibility
to specifically point out and
change these practices, other
sisters will continue to have
their heads and their lives
messed with.

Sincerely,
Sherilyn Brandenstein

Oops....

In our Aug. issue on rape we
reprinted an article by Susan
Griffin entitled “Rape-The All
American Crime.” Somehow
we misspelled her name and
we want to sincerely apolo-
gize to Ms. Griffin for this
egregious error.

Dear Big Mama Rag:

I may never find as many
women who people my heart
quite the same as you “Big
Mama’s” do. From start until
now, BMR has been in part my
recreation, in part my crea-
tion, and it has created a part
of me. Many women have
thanked me for the work I've
done on the paper. But I don’t
remember now if I ever took
the time to say thank you
back. So now, with those
crazy tears from the concert
returning to my eyes, thank
you! Thanks for being and by
being, giving me a chance to
be a part of you.

Love,
Elissa Meyer

Inmate Talks Candidly About Prison Life

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Earlier this summer, I visited Colorado Women’s Correctional
Institution in Canon City and interviewed Ronelle Lee, an inmate
at CWCI. Most of the women there are serving time for relatively
“light” crimes (dealing with dope, prostitution, passing bad
checks, etc.). In some cases, they were engaging in illegal
activities in order to survive and keep their families going. Ronelle
gave us the following descriptions of her experiences in prison.

Zak Rombakis

BMR: Could you talk about
what happens when you first
came here to CWCI?

RL: Okay. When you come
into the prison, you have to
stay in isolation for two
weeks. This is where they're
supposed to run all their tests
on you. They run a physical
exam and they find out what
you're allergic to. They find
out if you're a dope addict.
There’s a whole battery of
tests they run on you. Like the
CAT to see what your grade
level is.

When I got to the prison,
driving up there, you say,
“Hey, this is a beautiful

building.” You think you can
do the time in a nice place.
You sit up there in the control
room and wait for the officer
to come down. Here comes
someone in a white uniform
taking all your personal things
from you.

BMR: Who brought you here?

RL: The Denver
Sheriff's Department, two men.
No women guard at all.

So next I went to the isolation
or hospital. Well, when I first
went out the door, she told
me, “Don’t look around. Look
straight ahead or keep your
eyes down.” In other words,
don’t look at the people that’s
already in here. I will see them
when I get out of isolation.
Cause one girl that was there I
knew on the streets. And then
I found that there were a lot of
them I knew on the streets.
You go in the isolation
ward...you know, you don’t
know what to do anyway.

They take me downstairs and
say, “Pull off all your
clothes.” So I start pulling
them all off and they put me
on the table. Ran their fingers
all up in my butt and stuff to
see if I brought anything in.
Then they spray you...bug
spray. Wherever you have
hair, that’s where they spray
you. And it stinks.

Okay. After they sprayed me
and gave me a towel to dry off
with and gave me a pair of
pajamas to put on (no shoes
to put on), I got a shower.
Then they gave me ten
cigarettes. I was in a room in
the Lower South for Thursday.
Then on Friday they took me
out of there and took me to
the hospital for a physical
examination from the so-
called doctor. He’s had a heart
attack and he’s still a doctor.
This girl who was down there
in isolation has a number
that’s almost like mine. My
last number is 7 and hers is 6.
So I'm giving him all my
information to go in my chart
and he fools around and
writes it on her chart. ‘Okay.
He took my blood and put her
name on it. I stayed in
isolation for one month
because of that. They had to
keep repeating the blood test
because they kept saying that
something was coming up in
the blood. Then I said, “Are
you sure that you have the
right name from the blood you
took in the beginning?” They
said yes. I said, “You must
not, because the blood that
has all this in it isn’t none of
mine.” Later they found out
that this girl was really sick.

Women's Prison in Canon
City Sued by Inmates

Carol Lease

Late last spring a civil
action was filed in the United
States District Court against
the Warden of the Colorado
State Penitentiary, the Asso-
ciate Warden of the Colorado
Women’s Correctional Insti-
tution (CWIC), the Director of
the Department of Institu-
tions, the Chief of Corrections
for the State, the Parole Board
and the Physician for the
Colorado State Penitentiary,
on behalf of all women who
have been confined at CWIC,
are presently being confined
there, or who will be confined
there while the suit is pending
in court.

Among the violations to the
Constitution stated in the
complaint are that “the
conditions existing at CWIC,
from the physical arrange-
ment of the prison to the
degrading treatment of pri-
soners by the personnel,
subject (the women inmates)
to unequal and inferior treat-
ment on the basis of their sex,
violates their rights to equal
protection and in the totality
of the circumstances consti-
tutes cruel and unusual
punishment, all in violation of
the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Consti-
tution;

that women prisoners have
been deprived of their rights
to free speech, to free press,
their right to political associ-
ation and religious freedom
guaranteed by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution;

that inmates at CWIC have
been denied due process of
the law by being punished and
penalized for violation of
unwritten rules in an “arbitrary
and capricious manner;”

that the actions of the
wardens have violated the
Equal Rights Amendment of
the Colorado Constitution.

The complaint also cites
denial of access to the Courts
and to judicial process in
violation of habeas corpus and
due process as guaranteed by
the Fifth, Sixth and Four-
teenth Amendments to the
Constitution.

Class Action

This class action suit began
when husbands and wives
who were both confined to the
Colorado State Penitentiary
visited each other and com-
pared notes on their treat-

ment. It soon became obvious
that the women prisoners did
not have the same opportuni-
ties that the men did and were
treated more like children than
adults. One male prisoner was
a jailhouse lawyer and the
legal action was initiated, on
behalf of the women inmates.
Although there is an extensive
law library at the men’s
maximum facility, the initi-
ators realized that they needed
help from people outside the
prison walls. Help came from
the National Lawyer's Guild
and the Law Collective in
Denver. Later the court ap-
pointed Frances Olsen as the
attorney.

The Law Collective is
currently compiling affidavits
from women inmates and has
sent sets of “extensive”
questions to the Warden Alex
Wilson and Associate Warden
May Gillespie. “They are
required to answer all ques-
tions,"" according to Joan
Tempko of the Law Collective.
“If the answers given aren't
sufficient we will resubmit
them. They have to answer all
our questions whether they
are admissible in court or not.
If they don’t cooperate we can
get a court order and then if
they don’t they'll be in
contempt. But I don’t think
that will have to be done.”

After this stage is com-
plete, any person concerned
in the case can be deposed in
front of a court reporter or a
tape recorder. “We'll probably
talk to Ms. Gillespie a couple
of days,” and others too says
Ms. Tempko. “The whole
thing could take a year...Up to
a year ago there was no
contact like this with CWIC.
Then the Minority Women’s
Caucus and the University
Without Walls Teacher Corps
Program and the lawsuit all
became involved with the
women’s prison.”

According to Ms. Gillespie
the lawsuit is a “fad...we’re

And they were giving me all
these nerve pills which really
freaked me out. I would take it
in the morning and an hour
later I'm knocked out. That
was four times a day. So
finally I took myself off of it,
because I don't take nerve
pills as it is and I didn't want
any.

There I am walking around,
not knowing anything. I was
really spaced out, so they
bring all these tests for me to
take. I'm sitting up there just
marking anything down. My
mind couldn't function with
what I was doing. There are
500 questions on it. Ques-
tions like, “Do you like tall
women?”, “Who do you like
best out of your family?” or
“Do you lie very much?”
During the whole time I was
taking the test I'd just go
down the NO column and
draw a straight line.

When I took the CAT
test...now I have a high
school education and I've
been to college...then they go
telling me I can’t function in
the institution on showing
people how to do things
because I’m not qualified to
do it. The reason they say this
is because of the fact that
they don’t actually know what
a person can do and what she

After being locked up in
isolation, you have to go talk
to the warden. This is how the
interview goes with the
warden:

“I am the Warden here. My
name is Miss Gillespie. This

Woman as

Prisoner

Chocolate Waters

“Lord, help me this day to
learn to keep my big mouth
shut.” The plaques were
round and multi-colored and
also the very first things we
saw upon entering the Canon
City Correctional Institute for
Women. They had been
hand-made by the women
prisoners, who it would seem
from our visit, had learned the
lesson well. After all they had
to survive in this system while
doing their time and it was
obvious that keeping their
mouths shut was about the
best way to accomplish this
survival.

One thing must be made
perfectly clear at the outset:
all women, living as we are in
the patriarchal world—one run
by, on, and for the interests of
the other half of the species—
are living in a kind of prison.
The prison institutions, them-
selves, however—the way they
are run and the way women
inside are treated—are a
glaring example in miniature
of all women’s status under
the patriarchy and capitalism.
Women’s prisons confirm, in
concrete how the male-dom-
inated world views all women
in general.

This confirmation takes on
a variety of forms and sexism
and capitalism are at the root
of most of them: how women
are treated differently within
the courts and the flaws, the
kinds of crimes women
commit and for what purpos-
es, the way women are
controlled and indoctrinated
with “typical feminine” attri-
butes while in prison, the
kinds of “vocations” taught in
prison and the sparsity of
education and employment
programs for prisoners and
ex-cons.

Because of our economic
system, which is capitalism,
it is generally true that the
prison population of both
sexes is composed mostly of
the poor. Although studies
have told us that the average
urban resident commits ten
felonies a year, each punisha-
ble theoretically by a year or
more imprisonment, the ma-
jority of these people will
never see the inside of a
prison (not to mention our
ex-president). The people who
do not have access to money
and know-how are usually the
first to be incarcerated.

In a survey on court and
correctional services for wo-
men, the American Associa-
tion of University Women
found that 80% of the women
surveyed were unemployed
when they were arrested and
also that Blacks and Chicanas
were arrested more frequently
than Anglo women in com-
parison to their respective
ethnic communities.

Nevertheless, other than
being non-white and poor, the
similarities between women

Society tries to imprison all women and is generally
successful in doing so through its imposition of the
social-cultural-psychological-political-economic bars around us.
Some of us are less privileged than others and are often sucked
into penal institutions to do “time.”

A society sets up its own standards for crime and creates its
own conditions to encourage crime. So the criminal will inevitably
exist. And the treatment of a woman who commits a criminal act
in a patriarchy will be an exaggeration of her usual treatment in
the society. She is treated as a child, given no responsibility for
her life.

At the Denver County jail women who are either awaiting
trial or serving time have to or are encouraged to sew uniforms for
the men’s section of the jail. Women have to work or their
privileges are taken away from them, and they are not given “good
time” that will shorten their sentences. The men do not have to
work because there simply isn’t enough work for them. So why
can’t the men sew their own clothes?

At the Colorado Women’s Correctional Institution at Canon
City women sew shirts for other state institutions. The prison as a
source of cheap labor is a self-perpetuating system.

It seems that the ultimate idea behind the lawsuit against
the women’s prison is not exactly to provide women with the same
opportunities that the men have, but to stimulate serious
attention, research, and thought about the position of women in
the penal system. There are, however, individual changes that can
be accomplished to alleviate inequitable situations and Rudy San
Fellipo, the Director of the Department of Institutions, sees such
“administrative changes” as possible solutions to some
problems.

The prison psychiatrist at Canon City refers to women as
“junkie bitches.” The warden of the women’s facility refers to the
inmates as “my girls” as if she were running a finishing school.
She readily admits that a woman who has been institutionalized
for over two years will be harmed by being in the institution any
longer. But up to that time she feels that the “structured program
with a busy schedule with lots of things to do” is effective.

Indeterminate sentencing that is prevalent in courts today
places the decision for release on the prison officials and the
parole board. This gives tremendous indiscriminate power over
people’s lives to state officials who basically believe that as long
as there have to be institutions “we're proud of the ones we have.”

This penal system perpetuates itself. It will not make
decisions that would seriously jeopardize its existence. So any
impetus for real community corrections as an alternative to
isolated, alienating imprisonment that offers no rehabilitation and
is dehumanizing and alienating will have to come from individual
groups or a coalition of groups that are committed to prison
reform.

Women’s prisons are the ultimate oppression in a
patriarchy. The majority of women who are confined there are
guilty of victimless crimes, bad check writing and drug-related
offenses. They got caught while using survival tactics that many
women find necessary to exist in a society where women have little
power and are economically dependent on men.

Community corrections half-way houses must be
established in Denver and other communities for women to
“serve” time in. Then the prison could be turned into a museum so
the guards would have something to do. - C.L.

Out of Prison, Female
and Unemployed

Carolyn Agosta -

You’re a woman...there’s
strike one against you...you
have just been released from
Canon City on a charge of
conspiracy to commit a
burglary. While in Canon City,
you were taught to sew, wash
dishes and file. Now what?
Where does a woman turn for
help - finding a job, or
receiving training, finding a
place to live and food to eat,
clothes to wear and still keep
herself out of prison while not
having to resort to the old
habits that got her arrested
and sentenced to Canon City
in the first place? After speaking
with both private and com-
munity agencies that are
involved with ex-convicts, I
realized that a woman, just
out of prison and looking for a
job has little, if any help
available for her.

There are approximately 60
women and 1,250 men incar-
cerated in Canon City at the
present time. According to
Roger Lauen of the Teacher
Corps Program, “Women
should not be incarcerated for
the types of offenses typically
committed by women.” But
women are jailed and how
they are dealt with as convicts
and ex-convicts will...either
“make” them or “break” them
as self-respecting and self-
willed human beings.

In the prisons today, very
little is being offered to a
woman as hope for the future.
Once she is released there is
no more hope than when she
was in prison. Every person
that this writer spoke to
admitted that the conditions
in prison were worse for
women than men and that her
opportunities for any form of
rehabilitation were far less
than for men.

Discrimination

Sandy Carruthers of Better
Jobs for Women reports that
their agency is in the
“exploring stages” working
with other programs to dis-
cover what is already available
for women and what is the
“most viable plug-in” for their
agency. She states that she
hopes to have a referral
system set up by this fall.

Employ-Ex, which receives
funding from LEAA (Law
Enforcement Assistance Ad-
ministration) can only deal
with “high-impact” crimes,
which are burglary, robbery,
assault and rape. Only 1% of
all women imprisoned qualify
for help from this federally
funded program. George Ben-
ningfield, assistant director of
Employ-Ex, stated, “It is a
built-in discriminatory prac-
tice, since very few women
commit these types of
crimes.” He further reports
that since December of 1972
less than 10% of the convicts
they have assisted have been
women. The program is
supposed to help ex-convicts
to “become self-reliant.” They
are taught to “fill out
applications,” they receive
four hours of intensive coun-
seling to get them ready for
job interviews. They also
receive food, clothing, and
tools for a job and bus tokens.
There is no counseling to help
the ex-convict readjust to
family life and to the
community.

The Pinto Project, accord-
ing to Chuck Padilla, is just
beginning to take steps
toward assisting women who
have been in prison. They
have just met with a “major
business” to have them hire at
least two women who had
been in prison. Mr. Padilla
stated that it is “more difficult
to place women than men”
and to “combat the stigma of
her having been in prison.”
Their program concentrates
on what they feel are the three
major needs of a person just
out of prison: education,
employment and counseling.
Padilla also said that he felt
their program was “not highly
geared to help women” at this
time. But by October they will
have the funds to hire a
woman, preferably an ex-con-
vict to work with women in
prison. He further stated that
presently they “focus (their)
main attention on men, but
must gear it to women.”

The organization began at a
“Council of Unity” in January,
1971. People behind the
prison walls contacted Chi-
cana organizations asking for
their help so that they (the
inmates) could help them-
selves.

A staff of 17 was involved
with the program at the
beginning, but a drastic cut in
funds left barely enough for a
skeletal staff of 5. At the end
of October the Department of
Labor will be able to see its
way to funding the program
$292,000. Mr. Padilla says
that he has high hopes to then
develop the staff to its fullest
to meet the needs of both
women and men.

Vicki Romero of the Com-
mission on Community Rela-
tions had much to say
regarding women in prison:
“When she gets out, there is
not too much available to
her...women have it unusually
bad...there is no one to help
them.” One important point
that she brought was the
concern that women in prison
have for their children. An
agency that Ms. Romero
works with, Las Valentinas
(literally, the brave ones) tries
to help women by contacting
their families and children and
taking messages back to the
women, lessening some of
the pain and apprehension.

Her job with the commis-
sion allows Ms. Romero to
work with various groups such
as Las Valentinas, Minority
Women’s Caucus, Colorado
Caucus of Black Women and
Cooperative Endeavor #4 to
help identify community
needs the greatest of which is
penal reform.

College Program

There may be a small ray of
hope in the form of the
University Without Walls Na-
tional Teacher Corps. This is a
two-year program which has a
year to go. It involves 19
convicts and ex-convicts, only
two of whom are women due
to the ratio of men and women
in the penitentiary.

The women, one who is still
in Canon City and one who is
out on parole, have the
opportunity to earn a B.A. in
two years in non-traditional
working and teaching situa-
tions. The inmate is allowed
to leave the women’s facility
with minimal security once a
week for meetings; the
parolee lives in Denver and
checks in with the Teacher
Corps office to meet with
instructors. According to
Roger Lauen, the director of
the project, the program is
quite effective. There has not
been one drop-out. One
aspect of the program utilizes
the students as community
workers and crisis interveners
in assisting people with
problems. It is estimated that
over 2,000 people have been
aided through this aspect of
the program.

Some of the people at the
Teacher Corps have hopes
for an alternative to incarcera-
tion, that is a community
corrections program. This
would be a place where a
convicted person would sleep,
eat, and receive on-the-job
training and counseling. A
program to meet her total
needs from within the com-
munity."

Shecat

The Lesbian Task Force of  
NOW is alive, well, and  
growing newly-formed chapters state-  
wide. While Lesbians have  
always been a vital part of the  
women’s movement, our unique  
problems have not been  
dealt with on any large scale  
and our needs have not been  
articulated or acted upon in a  
positive manner. The purpose  
of the Lesbian Task Force,  
therefore, is to attack on all  
fronts the issues oppressing  
us as Lesbians.

Uplifted by the recent surge  
of energy in the Feminist  

unity; but decided to  

go my way:  
attend the first meeting of the  

newly-formed Task Force. I  
went out of a desire to find an  
appropriate way to channel  
energy into a forceful group. I  
definitely liked the sound of  
the words, “Task Force”  
--serious, positive, and po-  
tentially powerful.

I was far from disappointed.  
From among the 15 or so in  
attendance, I saw experience  
and inexperience, zealous-  
ness and caution, open  
activism, and the shyness of  
still being in the closet, but  
every woman there was there  
because she wanted to do  
something. We talked about a  
broad range of subjects that  
included legislation, educa-  
tion, politics, logistics, and  
tactics.

Right now, most of our  
energy is concentrated on  
gathering statewide support  
for a sweeping gay anti-dis-  
crimination package for the  
state legislature, and we have  
people working diligently  
contacting legislators, insti-  
tutions, every kind of contact  
it is possible to make, doing  
crash education where needed  
(which is almost everywhere).  
We also are gathering docu-  
mentation of discrimination  
for those liberal (and other)  
fools who keep saying “Show  
us a gay complaint.”

Other fronts of attack are to  
gain full Lesbian representa-  
tion on various commissions,  
such as the Commission on  
Community Relations and the  
Commission on the Status of  
Women. We have people  
pressuring religious, educa-  
tional, financial, and political  
institutions; some sisters are  
writing and developing edu-  
cational portfolios; some are  
working toward ending dis-  
crimination and harassment  
of Lesbians in prison; some  
are starting to coordinate a  
mail-order type of book  
service.

We are also supporting  
other Lesbian Task Forces in  
the state, as we are painfully  

in Denver and in  

aware that any significant  
changes in this state will have  
to come from all the outlying  
conservative areas and not  
just Denver alone.

Another issue in the Task  
Force is the importance of  
class consciousness. Clas-  
sism and elitism are issues  
that have not been dealt with  
satisfactorily in the women’s  
movement, and working class  
sisters are encouraged to  
express their anger in the  
hope that we will not in any  
way oppress each other by  
leftover attitudes from a sick  
society that has failed to  
achieve dignity and freedom  
for all.

Women in the Task Force  
have spontaneously formed  
special interest groups as  
they are needed. This process  
is remarkable to me, since I  
have seen many groups, even  
women’s groups, where the  
leadership is forced to accept  
the burden of responsibility.  
In the Task Force, it’s like we  
all are leaders, in a way. It’s  
more the fact of us all working  
together in harmony in a  
process of collective evolu-  
tion, rather than following any  
traditional form of getting  
things done. Every woman is  
given the dignity of leadership  
that otherwise would fall to  
just a few. Our energy has  
become synergistic, so that  
we grow as individuals at the  
same rate the groups grow.  
One of the best things that  
happens at our meetings as a  
result of our process, is that  
whenever we hit an issue we  
can’t agree on, a “brainstorm-  
ing effect” occurs, and we  
usually come up with some  
surprising alternative satis-  
factory to everyone and that  
no one individual would have  
thought of it alone.

Some of our dreams, I  
discovered, were far too  
utopian to be considered as  
current projects, like my own  
hope of creating a woman’s  
center large enough in scope  
to provide a place where  
women could go to learn  
everything they are denied in  
our present culture. This kind  
of dream is an evolutionary  
one, and we decided in terms  
of practicality alone that for  
the present, we have to begin  
by an all-out attack on those  
elements of our society that  
most refuse to accept our  
existence. Only then will we  
be more free to build our  
dreams in peace.

In any case, I am enthusi-  
astic about the Lesbian Task  
Force and proud of what is  
happening as a result of our  
energy. Somehow I always  
knew that women’s love would  
be a conquering force, for-  
midable in the eyes of  
opposition. It is incredibly  
beautiful to see it working.

KOA-TV Agreement

Signed

Chocolate Waters

An agreement has finally  
been reached with KOA-TV  
and Radio concerning the  
station’s programming and  
personnel policies in regards  
to women and minorities. The  
agreement was signed on July  
31 between the station and  
four groups (NOW, Mass  
Media Task Force, Sundiate,  
Inc. and the Co. Com. on the  
Mass Media and the Spanish  
surnamed).

According to Virginia  
Woodard, a representative of  
the Mass Media Task Force,  
there will now be 12 specials  
per year on minorities and  
women. Two of these will be  
devoted to women, one to  
Native Americans, three to  
Blacks, and six to Chicanas.  
(The reason that there will be  
more specials about Chicanas  
is that KOA did not meet the  
standards of a pact signed in  
1971 regarding Chicana is-  
sues). There will also be more  
air space devoted to public  
service announcements about  
women and minorities.

Towards the end of the  
negotiations with KOA Ms.  
Woodard said that there was a  
split among the coalition  
membership concerning con-  
sultancy fees. (KOA will have  
a nine-member panel consist-  
ing of women and minorities  
who will make suggestions  
about programming). Both  
Channel 9 and 7 pay their  
consultants but KOA is  
offering instead a $2,000  
scholarship to an outstanding  
woman or minority. Ms.  
Woodard stated that “women  
and minorities have volun-  
teered their services for free  
for too long,” and added that  
“NOW has a very strong stand  
on volunteerism and will not  
back down on this issue.”

Ms. Woodard also urged  
people to continue to call and  
write KOA if they disagree  
with the station’s program-  
ming, or if interested in  
photography or writing for  
television concerning issues  
of interest to women and  
minorities should contact Ms.  
Woodard at 986-7430.

Proposal for CU Women’s Center In the Works

Jan Throndson

The “Women’s Crisis Center  
Project,” once a minor plan  
for a women’s rap-line, has  
mushroomed into a full-  
fledged proposal for initiation  
at the University of Colorado  
this fall.

Ideas for a self-defense  
program, a rap-line emphasizing  
sexual assault and rape  
counseling, medical self-help  
programs, and legal counsel-  
ing are incorporated in the  
proposal.

Included in the plan to  
provide a central meeting  
place for university and  
community women, are a  
clearing house for women on  
other university campuses,  
officers for ongoing women’s  
programs, a coffee house and  
consciousness-raising  
groups.

Linda Christopher, spokes-  
woman for the project, said  
that the proposal for the  
center has already been sub-  
mitted to the University Plan-  
ning Committee, “so maybe  
we can be allowed to move  
into a university house on  
1229 University.”

Even though the proposal  
has the approval of Roland  
Rautenstraus, acting Univer-  
sity president, she said that the  
Planning Committee is having  
a problem defining the project to fit its  
housing guidelines.

“Our proposal doesn’t ex-  
actly fit their housing guide-  
lines,” Christopher said,  
“We're bringing together a  
bunch of different activity  
groups under one center. . .  
we're not just one interest  
area like East Asian Studies.”

Presently, there are two  
other women’s centers in  
Boulder--the CU Women's  
Center and the Boulder  
County Women’s Resource  
Center.

“The University Women's  
Center is more academically  
oriented and provides career  
counseling for women, but  
the city Women’s Center is  
actually just getting started,”  
Christopher said.

Although the Boulder  
County Women's Resource  
Center is still undecided  
about the format of their  
program, they are tentatively  
considering such interest  
areas as: employment train-  
ing, child care assistance,  
peer counseling, cooperative  
money-making projects and  
various other plans for wo-  
men.

Lesbian Mothers Defense Fund Formed

“A Lesbian mother, as other  
mothers who are raising  
children alone, faces an  
enormous daily struggle try-  
ing to make ends meet.  
Obviously, when a legal court  
battle ensues, there is often  
no money to hire a competent  
attorney; there is more often  
no attorney who will take the  
case without personal bias,  
and this coupled with an  
all-over hostile judiciary sys-  
tem lends to the terror all  
Lesbian mothers face when  
the threat of losing their  
children becomes a real live  
nightmare.”

Out of this need the Lesbian  
Mothers National Defense  
Fund has been born. This  

fund would give help with  
court costs, child care, food,  
clothing, attorney’s fees etc.  
It would ensure Lesbian  
mothers from all over the  
country a fair representation  
in court. It would also make  
possible the printing and  
distribution of guidelines,  
previous court cases and even  
make available films now  
being used in court.

In cases pending in ex-  
tremely hostile territory, the  
defense fund would provide a  
competent and sympathetic  
attorney with transportation  
from one state to another.

If you would like to become  
a member of this organization  
send $2.00 (less or more as  
your budget permits) to:  

Lesbian Mothers National  
Defense Fund, 1941 Division,  
Enumclaw, Washington,  
98002.

be unique, unlike any other  
women’s center in Boulder,”  
Christopher explained.

Of the other university  
women-oriented activities,  
Christopher said Birth Con-  
trol, Women Studies, Women  
Athletics and Day Care —  
Kiddie Kampus -- would  
hopefully be housed in the  
Women’s Crisis Center.

“Maybe a women’s center is  
the answer to getting things  
done together. . .the answer  
to better communication,”  
said Christopher who is  
jointly working with Nancy  
Polatti of the Boulder Com-  
munity Free School and Suzy  
Wiggins of the University  
Rap-line.

Christopher also stated that  
the group would like to run  
classes at the Women’s Crisis  
Center through such pro-  
grams as Women Studies,  
Experimental Studies and the  
Free School. “We would like  
to be able to pay our  
instructors though, and in  
order to do that, we'll have to  
ask for private contributions."

Two Women Kill Rapist, Edgewater, Fla. -- Two Indiana coeds
apparently strangled an assailant after he raped them and then
tried to kill them with an icepick, police said. Investigators said it
was believed the two women were hitchhiking when the
26-year-old man picked them up and drove them to a wooded area.
Deputies said the women had managed to choke the man with a
scarf and believing he was only stunned, had run to a farmhouse
and called authorities. When deputies arrived, they found him
dead. (Excerpted from the L.A. Times, 6/9/74)

Flagyl May Cause Cancer -- Three separate experiments have

Women &

History

MARIA MITCHELL, ASTRONOMER

Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818 on Nantucket
Island. By the age of 13 she was assisting her father in his work in
astronomy. As she grew older, she became the librarian for the
Nantucket Athenæum and spent her evenings watching the skies.

In October of 1847, she discovered a telescopic comet
which bears her name, and a year later, became the first woman
elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1850,
by unanimous vote, Mitchell was elected to the Association for the
Advancement of Science, again the first woman.

While Maria Mitchell had an unusually easy time
establishing herself in the field of astronomy, she did not forget
the oppression of other women. She worked both for the suffrage
movement and as president of the Association for the
Advancement of Women. While she was the first professor of
astronomy from 1865-88, at the newly founded Vassar College,
she criticized the male president and board of trustees for
employment practices such as hiring men for the highest
positions and giving women unequal salaries.

Believing that women had much to contribute to the
progress of society, Mitchell once said: “I wish we could give
every woman who has a novel theory dear to her soul for the
improvement of the world, a chance to work out her theory in real
life.” (reprinted from Uppity Women! A Legacy of Liberation.)

Thoughts from Diane diPrima

Diane diPrima, who recently read her poetry in Denver at the
Changing Scene, is a woman who has achieved much success in
recent years as a poet and writer. She has produced four plays on
Broadway as well as a number of books including Memoirs of a
Beatnik, Revolutionary Letters, etc. diPrima has been conducting
poetry workshops around the country as part of the Poetry In
Schools program and she recently helped teach a course entitled
Spiritual Poetics at the NAROPA Institute in Boulder. Having
grown up in NYC in an Italian neighborhood in the 50’s, diPrima
has often been identified with poets from the beat period such as
Allen Ginsberg. Presently living in northern CA, where she is
editing her unpublished writing and a book of essays entitled
Blessed Are The Meek, Baby, diPrima is married and the mother of
five children. The following thoughts are taken from an interview
conducted by Marian DeVito and Ronnie Burk and we would like to
extend our appreciation to the Boulder Gay Record for supplying
us with this information.

ON FEMINISM: Feminism for
me is kind of funny because I
grew up thinking women were
superior to men, that’s a
terrible chauvinism I hate. I
grew up where women took
care of all the business and
men were pretty, lovely... sex
objects in a lot of ways... When
it got right down to getting
food on the table, raising the
children, making sure you
didn’t get evicted -- whatever -- it
was the women who took care
of the business. So I always
grew up assuming that it was
my business, that I would
handle it -- essentially. So it’s
been very recently that I’ve
started to share, to live with
men on equal..., almost equal
footing. I never even tried until
I had my first baby. All I
wanted was a baby, my baby,
but I didn’t want a man. Later
when I was in love, it wasn't a
matter of assuming any kind of
superiority of relating

on a day-to-day level. So, like
Feminism was where I came
from.

COLLEGE DAYS: I went
straight from college to a
gay bar cause it was the only
safe place I knew in the city. It
was a place called the Swing
Rendezvous - 1953 - totally
peopled by very fierce street
dykes and a few mafia people
who ran the place and hung
out in the back. Both the
dykes and the mafia people
were very fond of me and my
friend Joannie. I left college

because I was in love with a
woman. Her name was Mari-
anne, a woman in my class.
We were both 17. She was in
love with my friend Joannie...

a typical adolescent situation.
I left college to

We all lived

together. Various things be-
gan to happen. Mother moved
in, the cops moved in,
Marianne was forced back to
school and I wasn’t forced to
do anything..., though my
parents were very conserva-
tive. Like, up until I went to
college, I wasn't allowed to go
to the opera in New York City
on a Saturday night. Once
they grasped they couldn’t do
anything, they didn’t stand in
the way. Their conservatism
was overrun by their basic
kindness and affection.

My father’s talk on homo-
sexuality was something like
this, “I've been reading up on
this subject and through my
reading I have found that the
main problem with these
people is their parents won't
accept them. Well, you’re not
going to have that problem
here. I don't want you to feel
that way.” From 18 until about
21, the atmosphere that
nurtured and protected me
was a gay one. The scenes
that I got into were very few
because I was very wary of the
amount of violence going on.
It was very full of knives and
bullets. The situation was one
with poor people; lots of
ghetto violence. I avoided
getting into many scenes with
the women that I met at bars,
but I did get very close to a lot
of them...

It was like home, a very safe
atmosphere. We were mutually
taken care of by the scene.
Our scene was relatively jail
ridden. We would get money
to bail people out and they
would protect us from the
streets in general. The mad-
ness! Like, we were sleeping

say Big Mama Rag for 10% off

in hallways. The same scene
that went on in the mid 60’s
except there were very few of
us. Later, I wanted a child, but
really didn’t especially want a
man. About a year after she
was born I fell in love with a
woman painter. Her name was
Evelyn McDaniels. She was
from Texas. It was a totally
stormy and very opening year.
It was the first time I took
peyote - 1959 - New York City.
She lived in a studio on Ave.
C, and I lived off Ave. B, an
incredible slum.

ON INVOLVEMENT: However, now I find myself very
scared to get back into a gay
scene. That's a funny thing to
say. It’s not very often I find
myself scared of things. But
I've found the degree of
involvement that I get with a
woman is so total, it meshes
on every particular level so
completely, that it doesn’t
leave any room to work. I can
really empathize with what a
woman is feeling. I can’t do
that with a man, which is just
as well. We can keep a little
space between us.

ABOUT CHILDREN: There are
different planes of history
going on in America right now
that don’t even communicate
at all. If one talks of official
political America, where is
that? Even when Rome began
to fall, it took 500 years to
finish it off. I can't wait that
long! The possibilities that
children have doesn’t seem to
have much to do with the
political or social structure of
America. I keep kids out of
school as much as I can. They
have their own theatre, draw,
paint, write, whatever, it’s up
to them. Instead of keeping
their fantasies locked up, the
way we used to do, they just
live them.

I can help them get the
space to do that. They’ve got to
figure out how to put it
together. I’ve found they can
pretty well figure out for
themselves. I try to run a
policy of non-interference in
my children’s work. It’s not
like allowing them to do
whatever they want to do... it’s
pretty much believing them
and backing them up. It works
out rather strange at
times... for instance, “You
don’t want to go to school
today, do you? It’s raining.”
They're the ones that assume
the responsibility, they
decide. “Well, I owe so and so
so many pages of Math, I need
to go.” It’s a great thing to
take on themselves at age
10 -- the responsibilities, to
develop those muscles, to
decide their lives.

ON SEXUALITY: There is
something about the homo-
sexual -- in a lot of ways -- is
a lot closer to being a whole
person. Bisexuality is really
groovy. The things society
makes you feel more and more
less whole. When you see the
old men, the old Indian men,
they are as feminine as
masculine. The same holds
true for the women, it’s a
different form of femininity. In
order to be a person with
power, a shaman, they have
totally amalgamated both
sexes. Basically, that’s what
the world’s been doing, that’s
what's happening, that’s our
trip. I used to always envy
snails. Know how snails
copulate? They have female
organs on one side and male
organs on the other and they
get together both ways. I think
I’ll try being a snail in my next
life."

Feminist School Ideas Come Together

Jackie Bryson

In late July five women were  
invited to discuss the idea of a  
Feminist school for children—to share what they know  
about education and about  
Feminism and to try to  
develop some of the principles  
by which a Feminist  
school would operate. The  
following article was taken  
from that discussion.  
BONNIE TRUMBULE - Director  
of Sebastian House, an  
alternative learning resource  
for people 12-18; Associate  
Producer of Anatomy of  
Women TV series; Mother of  
two young people, a daughter  
age 11 and a son age 14;  
Community organizer in Phil-  
adelphia Education Project;  
Former member of WITCH  
(Women’s International Ter-  
rorist Conspiracy from Hell).  
MARY BACKIEL - Spent two  
years teaching in the Open  
Living School in Evergreen,  
which is an alternative pro-  
gram within the Jefferson  
County Public School Sys-  
tem; Formerly a member of  
the Denver Women’s Theater  
Group.

YVONNE STITH - Teacher for  
two years at Lucy Stone  
Cooperative, an alternative  
Feminist-initiated day care  
project and is currently  
writing a book about that  
experience; Mother of two  
boys (ages 4 and 5); Original  
organizer of the Women’s  
Broadcasting Corporation;  
Has compiled a non-sexist  
educational program for pre-  
schoolers; Presently is em-  
ployed by Mountain Bell as a  
telephone installer.

LINDA FOWLER - Coordinator  
of Big Mama Rag; Linda has a  
daughter age 8, who has been  
enrolled for two years in  
Strawberry Fields, an alterna-  
tive elementary school in  
Denver; Was ADC (Aid to  
Dependent Children) Repre-  
sentative to the Advisory  
Board of Gilpin County Dept.  
of Welfare; Linda is a  
mountain woman who resides  
part-time in her self-constructed  
cabin in the mountains  
above Idaho Springs.  
JACKIE BRYSON - Former  
public school and Catholic  
school teacher in New York  
City; has two children, a son,  
5 and a daughter 3; was an  
active parent member of the  
Lucy Stone Coop for two  
years; Coordinator of Big  
Mama Rag and plans to attend  
DU Law School in September.

Jackie: We were trying to  
define some ideas for discus-  
sion tonight... some goals  
for a Feminist school. Or why  
a Feminist school, anyway?  
One of the most glaring needs  
seems to be that in public or  
alternative schools, while  
sexism may be a concern, the  
varying levels of conscious-  

ness about sexism, make it  
difficult to be clear about what  
you might want in an ideal  
school. Usually, there’s either  
constant confrontation—or a  
lack of it—that leads to  
frustration. Feminists seem to  
be reacting to rather than  
building something concrete.  
Bonnie: Even in a Feminist  
school, you'd still be con-  
fronting sexism. For example,  
there is a prospective teacher  
volunteering at Sebastian  
House. He is interested in  
alternative education and has  
something to offer. However,  
he constantly calls women  
“chicks” even though both  
Jerry (my husband) and I have  

talked to him about it.  
Feminist values are not a part  
of his life, no matter what we  
say. He won't be hired  
because I don’t want that kind  
of attitude expressed around  
the young girls at Sebastian  
House.

Yvonne: Also, an example  
would be set for the boys at  
Sebastian House. It would  
more or less give them  
permission to be sexist. We  
need male teachers to be  
models for boys, too.  
Jackie: I would like a school  
for my children where we  
would be starting with high  
consciousness teachers, so  
we wouldn’t have to spend a  
lot of time educating teach-  
ers—raising their conscious-  
ness.

Yvonne: There are a lot of  
Feminists working in different  
schools in Denver, and trying  
to raise consciousness where  
they are. But a different  
atmosphere would be created  
where Feminist goals were  
goals of the school itself  
rather than of one or two  
individuals working in the  
school.

Linda: I want teachers who  
are not afraid of giving values  
to students. It’s nonsense to  
be afraid to do so for fear of  
“laying your trip” on a kid. If  
you don’t give children some  
concrete values to relate to,  
they'll just attach themselves  
to the general cultural values.  
Which is what we don’t want.  
Jackie: But how would a  
Feminist school be different  
from any other good school?  
Yvonne: Everything would be  
different. The social environ-  
ment, the materials, books,  
posters, everything. There  
would be an emphasis on  
changing sex roles. Carpentry  
for girls, for example. Sewing  
for boys.

Bonnie: No. It would be  
carpentry for people. Every-  
one would be invited.

Mary: And you'd have women  
teaching carpentry. Being  
models for both girls and  
boys.

Yvonne: What I’m talking  
about is that sometimes there  
is a need for separatism  
within a school—the boys  
from the girls. For example,  
I read an article about a  
Feminist in a day care center  
where the girls and boys were  
both encouraged to do car-  
pentry. But somehow the girls  
seemed to lack confidence  
when working with the boys.  
So the teacher initiated  
separate carpentry for the  
girls until they were confident  
and capable of working with  
the boys. A teacher would  
have to be sensitive to where  
kids were at and how to try to  
change things.

Mary: Yes. You would want to  
hire people with a conscious-  
ness that would allow them to  
do those things spontaneously.  

Bonnie: But when you come  
down to it, I don’t think that  
this kind of thing we’ve been  
describing really attacks the  
basic sexism that exists—that  
permeates the society.  
Jackie: I think we're still  
reacting to what’s around  
us—with no idea of where  
we'd go without something to  
react against. One of the ideas  
I've been thinking about  
lately, is that I would want a  
school which would encour-  
age those parts of the  
personality which are “femi-  
nine.” The feminine principle—  
creative, close to the earth,  
cooperative, expressive of  
feelings, protective, non-des-  
tructive.

Bonnie: I’d call that human-  
ism.

Linda: No. What we generally  
call “humanism” is really  
patriarchy. This culture has  
been created by men and I  
think we can speak in  
generalities about it. It is  
competitive, aggressive, ego-  
oriented. Women’s history  
has been so hidden from us  
that we confuse ourselves as  
women, with ourselves as  
members of the human race.  
When people speak of the  
human race, they usually are  
speaking of the history of  
patriarchy. We have to search  
back into our roots to find our  
real culture.

Bonnie: I don’t like that. It  
seems to say that women are  
inferior. That they haven't  
been able to take control,  
therefore, they’re incompe-  
tent.

Jackie: No. It says that  
women haven't had control of  
the violent forces of society.  
And they don't want that  
control. By saying that you  
want to bring out the  
masculine in women and the  
feminine in men, you bring up  
a very dangerous proposition.  
Women must protect and  
fertilize what woman is. Not  
deny or discount it.  
Yvonne: Maybe androgyny  
would be a good goal for a  
Feminist school.

Bonnie: I don’t know. I get  
confused about which came  
first. I recognize a feminine  
principle. But did it come  
from women per se? Or was it  
a result of our oppressed  
condition? And the tasks  
assigned to us?

Mary: I have thought about  
finding out what a women’s  
culture is. I have broad ideas  
of women’s qualities. We  
need to sort out why we are  
that way. More cooperative.  
More supportive. We have to  
be careful to understand all  
these things so as not to lay  
trips on boys or girls about  
what they should be.  
Bonnie: Really, it seems like  
we're talking about two  
different projects. One of  
them with kids—doing a  
school. The other is a project  
with the women involved in  
the school—to investigate  
those ideas.

Mary: We need to take  
specific examples of what we  
mean. Analyze them. It must  
be an ongoing “discovery  
process—how that would  
relate to teaching. But teach-  
ing can be so exhausting. Can  
the two things go on at the  
same time? You'd have to  
start your planning early and  
at the same time have a group  
of people who would watch  
the process of how teaching  
may change—distilling the  
philosophy and disbursing it.  
Yvonne: As a teacher, I’ve  
seen kids on all sorts of power  
trips—size, age, sex, race.  
I've also felt that few parents  
really want you to impose  
your values or have any  
opinions at all. But I think that  
politics and a school are not  
inimical. You share what's  
important to you with your  
students—a book, an idea.  
And if Feminism is an integral  
part of your life, your teaching  
would reflect that.

Jackie: I can think of a  
specific instance. Pre-schools  
more and more encourage  
kids to talk about their  
feelings. Mr. Rogers, on TV,  
for example. But that kind of  
talking seems to stop for boys  
at some age. It seems like it  
stops about the same time  
that sexual identity as a male  
begins. It would be a goal of a  
Feminist school for all kids,  
especially boys, to talk about  
their feelings.

Bonnie: Yes. You'd create an  

atmosphere of concern where  
they could express their feelings. And  
you'd have to have a lot of  
faith that that atmosphere will  
work. Kids can give an  
incredible amount of support  
to one another, but that kind  
of relationship must be  
fostered by the school.  
Yvonne: And remember boys  
need heroes, too. Can we find  
some? For example, Henry  
Blackwell, when he married  
Lucy Stone, insisted that she  
not take his name, and he  
continued to publish her  
Feminist works for many  
years after her death. Or Chief  
Joseph and other Indians who  
have had their roots closer to  
the earth.

Mary: What about the ques-  
tion of male teachers? Where  
do you find men who believe  
in Feminism?

Jackie: Right. In hiring a  
teacher, I would want Femi-  
nist principles to be as  
important to that teacher as  
they are to me. I’ve never met  
a man who felt that way—who  
would call themselves Femi-  
nists and be proud of it. Very  
few if any, men understand  
the cultural implications of  
Feminism.

Linda: As I’ve been listening  
and discussing all this, I’ve  
come up with the conclusion  
that we may be talking about  
two different things and  
confusing them. There is such  
a thing as a non-sexist school  
and there is such a thing as a  
Feminist school. A Feminist  
school would explore the  
ideas of women, of women’s  
culture, women's values. It  
would consider the general  
culture to be a patriarchy, and  
start from that assumption.  
Bonnie: Then you'd be tipping  
the scale.

Linda: Yes. I think of tipping  
the scale back into the  
balance that patriarchy upset.

This article is also intended to be  
an organizing tool. Women  
interested in continuing this  
discussion or actually planning a  
Feminist school are urged to call  
the BMR office (322-2010). We'd  
be happy to coordinate."

advertise vb 1: INFORM, NOTIFY 2a: to announce publicly esp.
by printed notice...b: to call public attention to esp. by
emphasizing desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or
patronize.

Very simple, it would seem. And years ago it was. A simple
handbill or two, a barker in the market place extolling the virtues
of his wares. These were sufficient means to convey the supposed
worth of a product or service. But that was, indeed, years ago.

Today, advertising is a complex, major multi-billion dollar
industry in itself. And it has grown immeasurably in reach,
sophistication and subtlety. It utilizes virtually every known form
of printed and electronic media. From brochure to billboard. From
product label to company letterhead. From your car-radio to that
big 21” color tube in your living room. It is estimated that an
individual is bombarded by over 1,500 advertising messages, in
one form or another, each day. And so, because of its virtually
limitless reach, its relentless ability to pervade even the most
private aspects of our lives, advertising wields an enormous power
in this country today. A power which we, as women, would do
well to analyze, to understand, and when necessary, to challenge.

We can by no means put a blanket stamp of “evil” on all
advertising. It has been, and will continue to be, a provocative tool
for social and political change. It can also, however unwittingly,
be the prime instrument for the perpetuation of social and sexual
stereotypes.

In the months to come, this column will attempt to analyze
and/or bring to your attention those ads which specifically relate
to women in this manner. Particularly those in which the
stereotyping is most subtle. But for openers, let’s take a look at
one not too subtle example.

Moving That Tail

Continental Airlines had a problem. Some bright young soul
in the marketing department discovered that they were less well
known than the bus people over at Continental Trailways. In fact,
a marketing survey revealed that only about 10% of the flying
public knew about them, even though the airline boasts the best
on-time record and is acknowledged by its competitors to be the
best.

A further discovery: their five year old slogan, “the Proud
Bird with the Golden Tail”, was more well known than the
Continental name itself. Which was fine, if they could get a yellow
pages listing under “P” for “Proud Bird”. Which, of course, they
couldn't.

So, what to do? What to do? Somehow their advertising had
to generate quick name awareness and better associate that name
in the public’s mind with the best service.

Benton & Bowles, the ad agency, had a solution. You've
seen and heard it. Cheerful faces, stirring music, snappy lyrics.
And a rousing “At Continental Airlines, we really move our tail for
you!” Terrific! An absolute natural! Everything was there. Name
recognition, plus capitalization on a phrase that has traditionally
implied good service which, at the same time, cleverly
incorporated the already successfully established “tail” theme.

Unfortunately, some confusion arose as to just whose tail
was moving. Continental claims it meant to convey that it was the
symbolic Proud Bird's tail. The male flying public, given to its own
peculiar brand of symbolism, thought otherwise. The result: a lot
of CA stews who wished they were flying United’s “Friendly
Skies” instead...and an advertising campaign offensive to both
CA women and the female public alike.

A recent issue of New Times magazine reports that a union
official for the Steward and Stewardess Division of the Airline
Pilots Association “informed the airline that the slogan
represented ‘a movement back years in time... to a period when all
flight attendants were unfairly held out as sex objects.’ ”

No, no, protests Ms. Diane Levine, staff Vice President, CA
Public Relations. Smugly pointing out that the TV spots depict
both male and female employees, and that the outdoor advertising
features a stylization of their aircraft's famous “Golden Tail”, she
insisted to a group of Denver ad writers that the campaign was
conceived in utter innocence, with no intention of creating
suggestive innuendos. “The Continental Proud Tail is moving,
nobody else's. This is not to be construed any other way.”

Yet the New Times article further reveals: “To add insult to
injury—the company prepared a film to help stewardesses cope
with what it admitted might be one result of the ad campaign,
suggesting witty retorts to any provocative questions. For
example:

Passenger: ‘Will you move your tail for me?’

Stewardess: ‘Why, is it in the way?’ ”

Not to be construed any other way, huh? Oh come now,
Diane, really?

Postscript: The airline, already saddled with a record of
discrimination against women in the area of credit extension,
dismissed complaints by the union about the campaign as just
a lot of agitation by some “hard core women’s libbers”. They
charged that the women were using the issue as a grievance to
gain more leverage in contract negotiations. Leverage is needed, it
would seem. Recently, a California judge ruled in favor of a CA
stewardess who had filed a discrimination suit against the airline.
She had finally been fired, after having been suspended seven
times over the past year for being overweight...sometimes by as
much as half a pound.

Reader comments and contributions are encouraged.
Remember that the most effective way to put a stop to ads that are
offensive to women is to 1. Complain directly to the advertiser and
if possible to the advertising agency involved. Ad agencies must

An Interview: with Cassie

Linda Fowler

Casse Culver is a

Lesbian/Feminist songwriter

and musician of superb talent
and unique presentation.

Based in Washington, D.C.,
Casse is currently on a U.S.
tour performing for small
gatherings as well as larger
Feminist groups. She was in
Denver August 1, sharing her
art with those who attended
the Big Mama Rag benefit at
the Oxford Hotel and again
the following night at St.
Barnabas Church.

Casse accompanies her
unforgettable voice with gui-
tar, autoharp, harmonica and
piano. She has written over
200 songs with several re-
corded by Maria Muldaur and
country singer Dickie Lee.

Casse’s songs reflect her
personal experiences with
oppression and with a male
dominated society. She feels
it is this oppression and her
own feelings of dissatisfaction,
anger and hurt that
makes her music so appealing: “Because women as a
class are oppressed, it makes
the music universal. That is
why it touches as many
women as it does.”

Being a Lesbian has, said
Casse, “both hurt me and
confined me in my experience
with the recording industry. I
received no encouragement
from society to be who I am.
Being a Lesbian was very

limiting: I draw much of my
material from that. But the
record industry sees only
pocketbooks, not human
needs. So they sat on my face
for 4 years. It was an
atmosphere that was non-
supportive, gave me no
encouragement and offered
only negative comments
about my music.”

In 1972 Casse cut a record
backed by Maria Muldaur and
the Full Tilt Boogie Band. It
was never released because
the recording company felt
the ‘musical climate was not
right’. These struggles “have
made me strong and clear-
sighted,” said Casse, “but
that does not erase the loss of
time and my anger about
that.”

be held equally, if not more, responsible for the quality of
advertising. They are, after all, the creators and originators of the
advertising which their client (the advertiser) may accept or reject.
Then 2. boycott that product or service...again, let the advertiser
know you're doing it. And why. Often, the advertiser simply isn't
aware of the offensive nature of the ad. A lot of consciousness can
be raised with one letter or a phone call.

Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Have to Survive

Casse tried to fight the
system but was under a lot of
pressure simply to survive. “I
had to put my monetary
needs, feeding and clothing
myself, before my art. This is
the kind of thing that happens
all the time; mine is simply a
specific situation.”

So Casse left the straight
record industry, tried the club
scene, which turned out to be
pretty much the same thing,
i.e., the “show-a-little-more-
tit-baby” attitude, and is now
working to create a woman’s
musical culture with the help
of her “womanger” Spotts-
wood. Why a “womanger”?
“The word ‘manager’,” says
Casse, “is derived from and
implies to ‘manipulate’; to
turn someone into a purchas-
able product.” This definitely
is not the relationship that
Casse and Spotts have. They
both put full time and energy
into getting Casse’s music out
to the public. Spotts takes
care of the business matters
and Casse works on her
music. Their expenses come
off the top of any income and
the rest is split 50-50.

Feels Great Now

How does Casse feel now
that she is performing her
music for women? Great! “In
the straight music industry, if
you're writing about anything
other than ‘my man is here
and I’m happy and satisfied’ or
‘my man is not here and I’m
miserable and blue’ you don't
have a market. Supposedly.”
Casse is finding her new
atmosphere highly supportive
and energizing. Women, she
has found, are open to and
eager for a whole new area of
women’s art; one which
expresses their own feelings
and struggles.

Her audiences have, in fact,
been so supportive that Casse
is planning a new album for
the fall of this year. One that
will be on her own label,
Sweet Alliance Music.

Through Casse’s efforts to
politicize and unite women
with their art she is giving us
the soul of woman, moving
freely out of her own life and
struggle. It is a beautiful and
brightly shining soul, and full
of smiles.

Colorado's First Feminist Paper Speaks Out
in 1800’s

Open Letter

to Colorado Women

In a heavily guarded,
makeshift courtroom in the
Civil Defense building three
miles outside Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, a 56-year-old
Oglala Sioux woman is on trial
for riot charges. Sarah Bad
Heart Bull, an Indian mother
of 8 children, stands trial
because of her protest against
the white murderer of her
19-year-old son, Wesley, killed
in January, last year:

Wesley was stabbed to

death by Darryl Schmidt and

the state of South Dakota did
not feel it necessary to try a
white man for killing an
Indian. Sarah announced she
would travel (in the dead of
winter) from the Pine Ridge
Reservation to the distant
town of Custer to protest the
state’s inaction.

When Sarah and her sup-
porters arrived at the Custer
Courthouse to talk to authori-
ties, they were attacked by
riot policemen, arrested and
charged with conspiracy to
riot, riot where arson oc-
curred, disturbing the peace,
etc. Sarah was jailed and bail
of $8,000 was set.

When S.D. authorities
learned her bail would be
raised by an Indian Women’s

group, “Indian Women United
for Social Justice,” located in
Los Angeles, she was re-
leased on her own recogni-
zance.

Then in April of this year,
another son, Butch (age 18)
was shot to death by a white

was further brutalized by the
S.D. authorities when she and
other Indian defendants would
not stand to show their
respect for the racist Judge
Bottum, who had allowed

Due to the efforts of one
Caroline Nichols Churchill, a
woman of immense courage
and a staunch Feminist in her
time, Denver had a Feminist
Newspaper as early as Octo-
ber of 1879. This is the date of
the first publication of Ante-
lope. The reason for the name
Antelope was explained in
Volume I, issue 2 November
1879:

“Someone wants to know

why we call our paper the

Antelope.” We have several

reasons, which shall be

given as we “rise to
explain.” In the first place,
we wanted something that
had the least feminine
suggestion, something
graceful and beautiful ...
There is another reason for
calling our paper the Ante-
lope which we will give, but
modestly and blushingly,
inform our readers of this
last best cause least under-

stood: the Antelope is a

little deer, and is so difficult

to overtake.”

Caroline Nichols

was not only the editor of the

paper, she was also the
publisher and the woman
responsible for a large portion
of the paper's reporting. Many
of the issues that contempo-
rary Feminists are concerned

may be sent to the same
address.

Ed. Note: This letter from
Redbird (the chairperson of
Indian Women United for Social
Justice) was reprinted in part

from the July issue of Sister.
BMR supports this organization
and urges our readers to support
these issues as well.

with today were the subject of
articles and editorials in
Antelope. For example:
On Consciousness Raising
“There are plenty of women
in this land of freedom who
might better have borne
female pups and drowned
in puppyhood than to have
undertaken life with such
odds against them. The
manner in which women
conform to the errors of
education and submit to
imposition has no parallel
among men, although men
can be educated to fall
upon their faces before
fancied superiors, and to
echo the most absurd
opinions, dictated by their
lords. Persons must be
educated somewhat to a
sense of the injustice done
them before they are
capable of appreciating
assistance or sympathy.”

Dec. 1879)

At last, Pueblo has its own
women’s advocacy group in
the form of Women’s Informa-
tion Service of Pueblo. WISP
has been in existence for over
a year with the help of a
volunteer staff, and civic and
private donations. They now
have received an ACTION
mini-grant to use as seed
money for one year.

WISP seeks to increase
access to information, to
provide a missing service, and
to facilitate exchange of
resources between private
individuals in need. We hope
to mobilize a large number of
volunteers to obtain required
training, then branch out into
the areas of women’s pro-
blems, especially with low-
income and minority women.

Our staff usually consists
of women of all ages who have
been through some type of
crisis and feel they have
successfully gotten their lives

someone else going through a
similar situation.

On Sexism in the Media
“The papers speak of Mrs.
Romney who is now at
Leadville, as a very bright
woman. How would it
sound if we were to speak
of Ralph Waldo Emerson as
a bright man, of Horace
Greeley as a bright man, of
Jay Gould as a bright man?
Mrs. Romney is a very able
woman; one of superior
talents; one capable of
teaching many of the men
recognized as statesmen
today, and it makes us
fearfully jealous to hear
women spoken of thus by
the masculine press, and
we hope to see a reform in
this direction. No one
nowadays scarcely has
the audacity to

inferior unless it should be
a savage Indian or a stupid
foreigner. There are many
intelligent foreigners who
are in advance of the
Americans in recognition
of the claims of Women.”
(Vol. I, Issue 5, Feb., 1880)
ANTELOPE

On Caste Analysis
of Women
“If women or girls are ever
tempted to yield to the
selfish solicitations of men,
let them remember that
society is at present so
constructed as to hold but
one party responsible —
that for a general thing man
has a pride in whatever
woman is ashamed of
...Remember that every-
thing in nature exists by
contending forces by con-
traries...You will always be
persecuted. It matters not
whether rich or poor, if you
are at all worth noticing,
the good no more escape
ill-will than the vicious, and
are often perfect martyrs to
the tyranny of the wicked.
...When you marry take
your choice of men. If you
cannot do this, have the
sublime courage to live and
die an old maid. Do this
rather than give your
children a bad or worthless
father. Better for them and
for you that they have no
father at all....” (Vol. 4,

BigMammaRag,3,3,,11,BigMammaRag/BigMammaRagVol3No3_page011.txt,"Rock -on Gray Panthers ?

We challenge all forms of ageism + discrimination based on age.

We challenge compulsory retirement based on chronological age.

We seek the right to participate in determining policy and program decisions in the institutions that serve us.

We are a coalition of all ages, but especially the old and the young; who are outside the mainstream of society deprived of power and influence.

We seek improved public (Social Security) and private pension programs as well as better public and private health care, housing, and transportation, especially as these affect older people.

We are critical of the injustices, misplaced priorities, and discrimination based on race, sex, and age which exist in our society. We call for a reordering of national priorities which now favor military expenditures instead of supporting domestic needs especially affecting older people.

We believe in direct action on behalf of these principles including researching, lobbying, and publicizing these issues, testifying at public hearings, and participating in public demonstrations.

These are the principles of the Denver Gray Panthers, part of a nationwide network of individuals and groups “drawn together by deeply felt common concerns for human liberation and social change.”

The Gray Panthers were born about four years ago in Philadelphia by a coalition of retired persons and students. Among the first issues dealt with were the war in Vietnam and increases in social security. Retired people had the time and the freedom to act without fear of losing their jobs. Such issues as a national health plan, public transportation for reduced fares, housing, job discrimination, court reform, corporate responsibility, and the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment have been part of the focus of the Gray Panthers in recent years.

The Denver chapter of the Gray Panthers was organized in April of this year and has been successful in having walklight signals on Colfax and other streets lengthened so that all people are able to cross the busy streets safely. The Traffic Engineering department has been “very responsive” to this problem according to Dortha Howe, a member of the Panthers.

Other activities of the Denver group are issue forums for state legislative candidates which were held in August in conjunction with Common Cause. More are scheduled for October and specific information can be obtained by calling Common Cause at 534-8259.

Consciousness raising groups are being started that will be open to all - young and old, men and women. Anyone interested can call Ms. Howe at 831-7707, afternoons.

A shared living house for older people has been established in Lakewood at a cost of about $150 a month. Contact Fran Yehle at 237-0839 or Ann Voiland at 237-2495 for more information.

Action around the issue of nursing homes will be discussed at the next meeting of the Gray Panthers which will be held at Sunset Park at 1865 Larimer, on September 9 at 1:30 pm."

Trichomonas: This is another vaginal infection caused by a tiny
one-celled animal that has little whip-like tentacles that help it
swim around.

Symptoms: Once again the vulva and outer vagina will itch and
become inflamed (sometimes the rectum will become inflamed
also). The discharge will be greenish-yellow and either slimy or
foamy and the smell will be rather odorous.

Treatment: The only cure that doctors have used thus far is a drug
called Flagyl or metronidazole which is taken orally. It is
expensive and causes uncomfortable side effects. Recent studies
have also shown that the drug may be carcinogenic (causing
cancer) when used on laboratory animals. In other words, as a
cure it leaves a lot to be desired. However, there are no other
known prescribed cures, and the only herbal cure I have heard of is
to use creosote as a douche. The Tribal Medicine Council
recommends creosote as an effective cure. (Another cute thing
about Flagyl is that it can kill off the normal bacteria of the vagina
too, and lead to a yeast infection.)

Non-Specific Vaginitis: This infection is caused by a certain
bacteria (not by yeast, trich, or gonorrhea) and is very tricky to
diagnose and get rid of. The bacteria causes trouble only when
something disrupts the natural chemical balance, like being sick
or run-down.
Symptoms: You will have an itchy inflamed vulva, and a white or
yellow discharge which contains cells and bacteria (under a
microscope) and may be streaked with blood. If the bacteria get
into your uterus, fallopian tubes, or bloodstream, you may feel
back pains and have cramps and swollen glands.
Treatment: Sulfa drugs are used in cream or suppository form
every morning and evening for ten days. Brand names are Vagitrol,
Sultrin, AVC cream. If you are allergic to sulfa drugs, get Furacin
Vag-15 suppositories or Betadine douche cream. All of these are
prescription drugs, and alas! I know of no herbal cures.
Hopefully, these descriptions will shed a little light on how
to deal with these damnable infections. Learning to effectively
diagnose does take time and practice, but basically it isn’t that
hard to do. If you have self-help classes that are being taught

where you live, go to them! You can learn a lot about yourself and
help break down the monopoly of power that the male-dominated
medical establishment has effectively kept us trapped with.
Self-determination!

Big Mama Benefit

Wine, Women, and Song
#1, Big Mama Rag’s first
benefit was held at the Oxford
Hotel Aug. 1. Attended by
over 200 people, we might
even go so far as to call the
benefit a smashing success.
Sue Isaacson and Judy
Sarchielli acted as moderators
for the benefit and also
entertained us with their skits
and general craziness! The
Raw Honey women’s band

which includes Judy Blair,
Chris Schmeltzer, Lorrie
Baun, Bean Hollander, and

Susan Nichols provided great
boogie music for everyone to
dance to (even in the streets)
and individual members of the
Motherfolkers heightened the
audience’s high energy for the
first part of the evening.
Casse Culver from Washing-
ton D.C. really helped to pull
the evening off with her
combination of voice, guitar,
harmonica and enthusiasm as
well as her politics. All the
members of Big Mama would
like to extend our special
thanks to all the women who
entertained and to all the
beautiful people who made
the evening so successful.
We’ll be having more such
events in the future and hope
to see you all there again!

An Evening With Eva

Shecat
Eva Freund was in town
Saturday night, August 10,

and no one took notes. For
one evening, this powerfully
dynamic Feminist shared her
energies with us, and the only
record is inscribed in our
consciousness.

The main thrust of what she
said concerned the dynamics
of Feminist group politics,
especially Lesbian interaction
with NOW and other organi-
zations. (Eva left the Gay
Activists Alliance to spend
more energies with women in
NOW on the National Lesbian
Task Force; she is no stranger
to struggle. The most com-
prehensive gay anti-discrimin-
ation bill in the country was
passed recently in Washing-
ton, D.C., under her leader-
ship.)

One of the most significant
ideas she shared was the
concept of power bases; she

emphasized the necessity of
forcing power downward
through the ranks of every
group to give equal leadership
among the members. One
reason this is necessary is
that there are too many things
to be accomplished in a
Feminist society to expect a
few to carry out the demands
of the many. Also, in order for
every woman to feel the joy of
accomplishment, every wo-
man must carry her share of
the responsibility. This also
helps eliminate the burnout
factor among the leadership.
Rotating the duties of coor-
dinator on a frequent basis
(every few months) helps
achieve this goal.

Another way sharing power
bases can be accomplished is
for a small group (such as
Lesbians) to be outrageous (in
a variety of creative ways) and
then use that to raise

Lyn Alweis

consciousness. (Get the

group’s attention and then use
that power for positive
change.) No one is going to
validate Lesbians or straight
Feminists; we have to vali-
date ourselves, and we’d
better get busy.

Eva listened to our pro-
blems and our joys, shared
many valuable experiences of
Lesbian Feminist struggle,
and left us feeling positive
and strong. Eva Freund is
impossible to share with
others second-hand; she has
to be experienced.

Eva, if you read this, the
Colorado dykes you met love
you. We still have much to
share and much to give.
Please come back again."

is Lt. Cooper. This is my penitentiary. You do as we say to do in here. You don’t go to other girls’ rooms. There is no body contact. You don’t touch. We do not practice homosexuality in our institution.”

So she runs it all down to you. No body contact means that if you had some death in your family and you were crying, and I’m one of your friends and I come up to you and say, “Hey, everything is gonna be OK.” and I pat you on the back to console you, then I’m accused of being a homosexual. That means that you and I have a thing going because of the fact that I’m patting you and consoling you.

After you talk to the warden, you go on up to your wing area and they assign you to your room. You might meet some of the girls in that wing area. I put all my things on the bed, then I went out with one of the girls that knew me. We went outside. I was shaking like this. I was really nervous because I’d never been around a lot of people, especially women, in the joint and it really got to me.

BMR: What’s the daily routine? Does everybody work?

RL: Six o’clock in the morning they come over the speaker and say, “Good morning ladies. It’s six o'clock.” BMR: The rest of

are girls. you're ladies?

RL: Right. Six-thirty comes and it’s time for count. You're laying in your bed, really resting. Six-thirty comes and you have to get up out of your bed, go to the door and stick your arm out until the officer comes down and counts every arm. On her way up, she says, “Thank you” and you can put your arm back in. If you want to stay up, you stay up. You have to be out of your room for breakfast at 7 am.

You go to the dining room and you have to sit at the seat where you're assigned. After breakfast you have your medication. If you work on the cleaning crew you have to go down to the auditorium at 8:00. If you’re in the sewing room you have to be there at 8:00.

BMR: How many different work areas are there?

RL: You have the cleaning crew, the sewing room, the yard crew, the state and industrial sewing room. You can work in the library or the kitchen.

BMR: Does the women’s kitchen prepare food for the men’s prison, too?

RL: No. Only for the women. In the women’s kitchen, they don't have enough stuff to work with, as far as cooking is concerned. Not enough seasonings. And they have a food service class! Now you can have vocational training. You can take typing, bookkeeping, shorthand, and filing. That’s it. Now I’ve been through all of that. I didn’t have anything to do.

BMR: Are the classes every day?

RL: Every day of the week. But you have to do your work detail. In the laundry you might be there an hour. On the cleaning crew you go to work at 8 and you might get off at 11. You never know how long you may have to work.

BMR: Which means when you get up in the morning, if you have something you want to do that day, like writing or something, you never know during that day when you're going to have some time to yourself.

RL: Right.

Interviewer’s note: If an inmate at CWC doesn’t behave in the approved manner, the prison administration has a number of ways to pressure her into obedience. One of the more effective ways is to threaten her with an extension of her sentence. This threat keeps many women from speaking or rebelling. Another disciplinary method, which has both immediate and long-term implications, is to place a woman in lock-up by herself.

BMR: Can you tell us something about lock-up?

RL: It’s the same room that you have isolation when you first come in.

BMR: What’s in there?

a blanket and a washcloth. What was so funny about it was that they took the string out of my pajamas so I couldn’t hang myself, but if I'd wanted to, all I'd had to do was to take the radio earphones and hang myself. They were still in there. Or the sheets. I could have taken my pajamas off and hung myself too.

BMR: Do people use cigarettes as barter in the women’s prison?

RL: Some people might. I don’t. See, you get two packages of Pall Mall on Friday. They give you one bar of soap. You can get 12 Kotex.

BMR: No tampons?

RL: If you want Tampex you have to take your own money and buy them.

BMR: What is contraband here?

RL: We can’t have gum. The reason for that they say is because ten years ago Sally Sue had gum and she jammed a lock. Or five years ago somebody had gum that she stuck on her plate and it got jammed in the dishwasher. You can’t have lighters. Because if there was lighter fluid around you could start somebody on fire. Our people can’t send anything in, like homemade goodies. Something might be in it. They’re afraid your parents might put some dope in it.

BMR: Are drugs easily available?

RL: No, but you can get drugs into the institution.

BMR: What are some of the ways that women relieve themselves of the insanity here?

RL: Well, now we can have tapes and radios in our rooms. And you can read or knit or crochet. That's what I don't understand about all this contraband. You can’t have matches and all this other stuff, but you can have scissors and knitting needles, needles, pins. Knives are contraband. If you want a knife, all you got to do is go down to the kitchen, put it in your sock and walk back to your room.

BMR: What else can you do?

RL: Well, you can pick up a book or do whatever you want in your room. But really you don’t have privacy in your room. The officers come and look in all the time.

BMR: And you can’t have a friend in?

RL: Not in your room.

BMR: So what you’re saying is that in the women’s prison there’s very little contact between the women as individuals?

RL: Right. Very little.

BMR: I'd like for you to talk a little bit about being gay in and out of prison.

RL: Okay. Well me, for instance. I’m gay. I was gay when I came in and I'll be gay when I leave. In the prison, you’re around women. You might see someone you might dig on and you might want to be with that person. So you rap to each other and you get real close to her.

BMR: When do you get a chance to talk to her?

RL: When the yard is open. Or going to dinner together. If you're in different wings, then you can go over to her wing and talk to her. You just go and stand at her door. She might pull a chair up to the door. But you can’t go inside anyone's living quarters but the one you're in. You can talk in the beauty shop when you are doing each other’s hair.

BMR: That's the only body contact you can have?

RL: Yes, when you're doing somebody's hair.

BMR: How many women in the institution are Lesbians?

RL: There are so many changes coming down here. There’s probably only two for real. Then there are some that came into the institution and don’t have anything better to do than this, get it on with women. They think, “I got to do my time. I might as well have somebody to do this with.” It's an outlet.” So they get involved. But there’s not that many who come in gay.

BMR: What are some of the differences that you can see between what happens in the women’s prison and in the men’s prisons?

RL: They have more freedom than we women do. I guess that’s because there are more men locked up than there are women.

Interviewer’s note: Ronnell didn’t expand on this point. A noticeable difference between the men’s and women’s institutions is the larger variety of vocational training and educational opportunities available to men. It seems that there are also fewer petty rules at the men's prisons.

BMR: What do you think is our responsibility as women outside to those of you who are inside?

RL: Women on the outside, not being aware of prison and how it really is, should get some type of group together and come and visit the women's institution. They should see how each woman feels in there about being locked up. There needs to be more communication among all women, inside and out. There are some women inside who have kids. There are women on the street who have kids and they're not away from their kids. They need to know how it feels to be away from your child, being confined, doing time. Women on the outside have no knowledge of this. You need to see how a woman feels when she has to go and do time and when she gets out her child doesn’t know her.

Like the NOW women came down and one lady brought her little boy down. Everybody was really enthused. But if they had their kids to come in, they would be more happy than they are now.

BMR: In other words, people on the outside should try to find out who has a child and bring them along when we come to visit.

RL: Yes, that’s one of the things I want to do when I get out. I want to relate to women on the outside that prison life is not for a woman. It’s really not. I want women to know, “Hey, don’t commit any crimes. If you got a man and he’s pimping you, tell him you want to do something better than going to prison.” You got responsibilities out there. You got more responsibilities if you got a child. Say one of my best friends had a case. She might have ten kids. She’s worried about what her kids are going to do, whether they’re going to go on welfare or the welfare department is going to take them away from her and all this. Before I see her kids given away, I'll take the rap for her.

Interviewers note: This was all the time we had to talk with Ronell during our initial visit. She is interested in staying in touch with women outside of prison. Those of you who are concerned about women inmates should consider visiting the women at CWC and possibly taking an inmate's child for a visit. For more information about the subject, read Women in Prison by Kathryn W. Burkhart."

Psychology of Women:  
A Study of Bio-Cultural  
Conflicts. .  

Judith M. Bardwick.  
Harper & Row, New  
York, NY: 1971.  

In Psychology of Women,  
Judith M. Bardwick, Ph.D.,  
has confirmed and acknowledged the experiences that  
Every Woman has had. No  
longer need we worry about  
“penis envy”: we have our  
own reproductive organs and  
our own perceptions and our  
own reasons for feeling and  
acting as we do, in spite of the  
male sex.  

Bardwick herself has a  
Ph.D. and three children. She  
thinks that maternity and  
taking care of the young are  
crucial experiences for the  
self-identity of women. She  
claims that little girls don’t  
grieve for the penises they never  
had. As anyone who has been  

around little children will  
attest: a little girl who sees a  
pregnant woman is very proud  
to hear that she too might one  
day have a big belly and a  
baby (if she wants to). In other  
words, girls have their own  
source of pride and identity,  
right there in their own  
bodies.  

The notorious “passivity” of  
women just might happen to  
be functional, a necessary  
coping technique during such  
crises as pregnancy. (A  
woman who answers the  
demands of small children  
can hardly be called passive!)  

Bardwick discusses at  
length the relationship of  
women to their bodies. As it  
turns out, our bodies are  
fascinating. The menstrual  
cycle is a finely orchestrated  
balance of hormones, some-  
times operating in high gear  
and sometimes in low gear.  
When our hormonal levels are  
high, there is some indication  
in the research that it might  

contribute to a positive,  
nurturant psychological state.  
Pregnancy is one time of high  
hormonal levels -- and preg-  
nancy is certainly a time when  
a positive, well-integrated  
personality is very important  
to the well-being of the future  
child.  

Bardwick also talks about  
possible causes of heightened  
sexual arousal during mens-  
truation. She also suggests  
some possible psychological  
effects of taking birth control  
pills.  

Bardwick also describes the  
cultural influences on young  
women experiencing mens-  
truation, their first inter-  
course, marriage, orgasm,  
childbirth, etc. Some of her  
theories are as yet unprova-  
ble, but it is nevertheless  
worthwhile to read a feminine  
rendition of all the life crises  
that men are so vocal about.  

Again and again the author  
describes the denigration of  
female achievements in a  

culture which values male-  
ness. This is the part that  
roused the old feminist anger  
in me. While girls are being  
told to succeed scholastically,  
on the one hand, and then  
told not to do too well, on the  
other hand (so that they don't  
alienate prospective hus-  
bands); while they're being  
told that having babies and  
taking care of a home and  
husband are the most crea-  
tive, most contributory things  
they could do; they are  
simultaneously being put  
down for being “just house-  
wives”. As Bardwick notes in  
her chapter entitled “The  
Motive to Achieve”, the  
highest accolades of this  
society go to men who are  
competitive and achievement-  
oriented. If women exhibit the  
same behaviors, they’re told  
that they’re being “unfemin-  
ine”. Damned if you do and  
damned if you don't.  
Bardwick’s theory of an  
“affiliative motive” in women  

Page 15  

probably is the most contro-  
versial part of the book (or at  
least to a lot of women today  
who are trying to explore their  
achievement needs). She says  
that, given all the condition-  
ing that we've had, and  
possibly also due to genetic  
givens, a young girl has a  
need to establish a related-  
ness to a man and to her  
children. She will supposedly  
feel anxious if she fails to  
fulfill the traditional female  
role for a while.  

At any rate, whatever your  
sex or your persuasion, I think  
that this book would be a  
pleasure to read--if only  
because an intelligent woman  
has devoted a lot of serious  
thinking and a lot of research  
to the biological and cultural  
realities of womanhood today.  

Magazines  
Womansports  

Elisa Laramore  

Athletics and sports are  

rapidly arising into their  
rightful positions in women’s  
daily lives. With this new  
awareness women are feeling  
health, strength, and a new  
purpose.  

It seems only natural that  
this fresh power should be  
shared with one another. One  
method of sharing ideas and  
experiences is through the  
media.  

Just recently introduced  
into the vast spectrum of  
journalistic media is Billie  
Jean King’s publication wo-  
men Sports. Born out of anger  
about almost non-existent  
media coverage of women’s  
sporting events, women-  
Sports is definitely a sight for  

Amazon Quarterly  

Sandy Belgrade  

This critique started out to  
be a magazine review, but  
something more than an  
issue-by-issue analysis  
seems needed. To dismiss  
Amazon Quarterly as just one  
more printed contribution is  
to miss the point for the  
magazine and for ourselves.  
What I really want to discuss  
are the promises and vision of  
a women’s culture and the  
way Amazon Quarterly fits  
into that perspective.  

In its short herstory, the  
Women’s Movement has  
reached a point of promise,  
one that reads: we are no  
longer concerned with re-  
formist issues, nor with one  
more periodical which just  
reports and records and does  
so in a timely way. We are, I  
believe, at the point which can  
be interpreted as follows:  
enough rhetoric. Enough con-  
fessions and personal odys-  
seys. While these fulfill me on  
one level in that they let me  

very sore eyes.  
The text is fascinating to  

me and I find myself drinking. =  

Indeed this magazine is long  
overdue. The regular features  
include “Kickers” - a potpourri  
of breakthroughs and unusual  
happenings; “In a Pigs Eye” -  
delightful satire; “Aces” -  
write-up on women who win it  
all; “Foremothers” - a new  
look at herstory; “Off the  
Wall” - funny stuff, but sad,  
and “Snapshot” - seeing is  
believing.  

The articles themselves are  
the real fruit and vegetables of  
this magazine. I delight in  
seeing everyone from the  
superstars to the novice  
athlete -- real people just like  
you and I. The women  
describe in detail their experi-  
ences which are deep and  
sensual. Informative articles  

know others feel as I do (i.e.  
have taken the shit as long as  
I have), they do not fill a much  
larger need. A need which  
recognizes our disaffection  
with the realities, our desire  
for theory and more concrete  
suggestions for positive ac-  
tion.  

What this quarterly promis-  
es is that it can incorporate all  
forms of writing and stimulate  
women to action through its  
sense of vision. This is a  
moment in time when power  
and vision are yearning to be  
reconciled, and it is in light  
of vision with the promise of  
action that this commentary  
on AQ is offered.  

Started by Gina and Laurel  

This quarterly, which will be  
two years old in October, was  
begun on the West Coast by  
two Lesbian Feminists, Gina  
and Laurel. Unlike that slick  
New York operation which  
claims to speak for MS, AQ  
does not speak for women on  
a “radical chic” level, nor do  
they see themselves as merely  
an art journal. In their first  
anniversary issue, Gina stated  

on ‘How to’ just about  
anything are plentiful.  

The most Moving  

The Agony of Victory” written  
by a middle-aged marathon  
runner who finished last - but  
she finished. The very fact  
that this article was published  
shows some real understand-  
ing of what it’s like to be a  
woman athlete -- win or lose.  

I'm impressed with the  
women in these articles, I had  
no idea women were compet-  
ing in so many fields and so  
well. Inspired is putting it  
lightly.  

I must be honest however  
and point out what I feel to be  
some real drawbacks. First  
and foremost Billie’s shallow  
Feminism. Allowing such  
inane articles as “Why Women  
Lose” by Dr. Thomas Bos-  

that she wanted to see the  
paper evolve from being some  
static entity. That unlike  
society which as a whole  
emphasizes nouns and there-  
fore fixed identities, they  
wanted AQ to verb, to  
participate actively in the  
creation of a woman-  
centered culture. There are  
millions of women hungry for  
provocative articles which will  
force them to rethink lan-  
guage and give them the kind  
of insights that can result in  
definitive action. A look at one  
recent theoretical essay may  
illustrate how the best in  
writing can be words that are  
accurate maps of the world  
and our role therein to bring  
about true social change.  

In Vol. 2, Issue 2, Laurel  
powerfully dissects the male  
mirror, her symbol for the  
complete and pervasive way  
that the patriarchy emits and  
reflects its own image and  
values in the world. Patriarch-  
al influence is so widespread  
that even total separatism  
does not wipe out its  
corrosive effects. While many  

issue “The Thrill of Defeat,  

looper and Marcia Hays (July  
1974) is evidence on that  

hardly a tribute to the goals of  
the Feminist movement at  
large. I personally would like  
to see womenSports become  
more radical in that respect.  
Image building--a nice middle  
class publication that poses  
little threat to the male-dom-  
inated press is one irritation  
for me. However I suppose  
they must keep their adver-  
tisers happy. Possibly that’s  
why they ignore the blatant  
fact that many of our lovely  
heroines are Lesbians. Preen-  
ing and primping still lives as  
they purposely emphasize the  
beauty queen aspects of some  
of the superstars like horse  
racing's Mary Bacon, Miss  
San Bernardino of San Diego  
basketball fame, and lovely  

women writers have written in  
response to the negative,  
existential rays coming from  
that mirror, trying to form  
their own values in its  
reflection as it were, too few  
have surfaced to transcend it.  
The smashing of that mirror  
and the corresponding creation  
of a mirror that reflects  
the feminine principle is the  
beginning of woman vision--  
one that is in touch with the  
needs of the earth, one that  
speaks to the female process  
ethic.  

Communication Lifeline  

This is communication  
looked at as a lifeline and a  
network to establish a vision  
in which we can all partici-  
pate. It speaks to us from the  
depths of our hope, and it can  
be our source of strength if  
words really can be tangential  
to action. What AQ intends is  
no less than the complete  
demise of the phallocentric  
system that purged our  
herstory before and will again  
unless we act this time  
around.  

Glenna Sacks, racecar driver.  
It isn’t easy to tolerate  

unless she’s queer?” (Mary  
Bacon July 1974 pp. 33). Or  
negative inferences that gym  
teachers and/or athletic wo-  
men are gay, Billie Jean and  
company are bending over  
backwards to deny what every  
one knows. Even Newsweek  
will casually admit “There are  
a number of Lesbians among  
touring pro athletes...”  
(Newsweek, June 3, 1974, pp.  
52) womenSports seems to be  
suffering from a bad case of  
Closetitis.  

Harsh words aside - wo-  
menSports is informative, fun  
and necessary. I wish them all  
the success and good fortune  
they deserve and I hope to see  
many more issues.  

Amazon Quarterly holds the  
promise of being a forum for  
women to communicate what  
the feminine mirror can be and  
how each of us can contri-  
bute. It is true that several  
topics I would like discussed  
have not yet been dealt with  
(for example, I would like an  
in-depth essay on how the  
divisive aspects can be  
dispelled, especially those of  
class and race since for too  
many women the movement  
has a middle class aura).  
However, as Amazon Quarter-  
ly begins its third year we  
might heed their call for more  
contributions from women: to  
read it, to share it, to  
transform it is no less than a  
call to active participation in  
our lives and the end of being  
mute witnesses and readers."

Whe Weve the

Linda Fowler

As you have all surely noticed, Big Mama Rag has been
changing fast, and growing so rapidly we can hardly keep up with
her. We thought you'd like to know what’s happening with your
newspaper, beyond the printed page - inside BMR.

We also want to let you know what some of our needs are
and hope you will let us know about yours. Our aim is to
continually increase BMR’s effectiveness as a service and
communication organ for all women.

Perhaps the printed page is a good place to begin.

During the past few months, BMR has doubled in size. The
features section has been expanded with more in-depth coverage
of issues relevant to local women. We have added more interviews
with both local and nationally known Feminists, expanded the
poetry section, increased book and film reviews, added regional
news, national news, a Women and Advertising column, and a
calendar of events. Plans are to add a financial column (to help
women with money planning and management), to expand
coverage of working women and labor union women, and to add a
section on the herstory of women. Casse Culver and Spottswood
suggested more analysis of the political aspects of Lesbianism.
We hope to offer more here.

What We Need

We need writers to help with features, articles on theory,
analysis, news stories, and poetry. Along with the larger BMR
have come needs for more graphics--send yours in! We need a
graphics editor; someone to take on the job of finding artists,
lining up what needs to be done, doing it or getting it done. We
also desperately need a good proofreader, experienced, if
possible. This job would take about six hours per month.

More advertising to pay increased printing costs; call us
(322-2010) if you can help sell ads (even 2 or 3 hours per week). If
you know a business which might take an ad, call us. Take a
classified with us— 8 cents per word.

The demand for the paper is rapidly growing. Every day
women call the office asking where BMR can be bought, and our
distribution outlets are increasing. We plan to triple (for a start)
these outlets and are working on this now. It’s a big job. Please
help. We need women to get new outlets, stock existing ones, and
ultimately we will need someone to take over distribution
coordination entirely. This involves responsibility for all mailings.

Income is increasing, but so are expenses, so we are still
not out of the dark here. We're picking up about 30 new subs per
month, plus doing bulk mailings to bookstores and women’s
centers around the country.

We're increasing promotional activities and hope to offer
more women’s cultural events: music, poetry readings, film
series, etc.

We need: more subscriptions . . . Encourage everyone you
know to subscribe. Pledges. . . No amount too small or too large. $
for salaries. . . A better BMR requires more time from staffers.
Many are volunteers, some receive a bare subsistence wage.
Putting out the paper is a full-time job and can’t be done without
some salary money. If you know individuals or community-minded
groups who could contribute to this, please encourage them to
do so.

Where We Work

We've recently doubled office space to accommodate our
increased activities. We need: desks, overhead lights, chairs,
paint, envelopes (business size), thumb tacks, a 4x6 file card box,
note pads, lettering for our door, money (the rent went up).

We've talked a lot about classism and plan an issue on class
and Feminism, possibly for October. We also plan issues on day
care, women and madness, women in the military, revolution
(psychic, physical, spiritual, personal, political).

We hope to publish a poetry anthology from past BMR’s in
time for Christmas.

We are trying now to make BMR a regional women's
newspaper for the West. We need correspondents and distribution
points in all Western states. If you have contacts, let us know
about them, or them about us.

One of our big dreams is to publish every two weeks. We're
tentatively aiming for January or February of 1975. This is going to
require more full-time staffers and, thereby, more money for
salaries to pay these staffers. We're checking out possibilities of
grants for this purpose. If you have ideas on this, we'd love to hear
them.

What We’re Thinking About

Five of us are now living collectively, sharing a painting job
and a secretarial job and working almost full-time on BMR. Big
Mama pays one $250/month salary, which we also share. (We are
house painters--if you know of any jobs we can bid on, please get
in touch.)

In our personal lives we have been dealing with the overall
question of a woman's civilization and what that means. We feel a
woman’s civilization has to happen on all levels: cultural,
spiritual, political, personal, and philosophical, and are working
on these areas within our living collective and within BMR.

Living collectively has brought us many challenges and
many changes. And a lot of personal growth. We've had to define
and re-define our purpose and the way each one of us fits into
that. We've become more responsible to ourselves, each other,
and the women's community. We are stimulated; we work harder;
we see results; these results, in turn, give us added stimulus.

But while our minds and souls are turned on, our bodies are
exhausted. We’re looking for ways to solve that problem, for we
learned long ago the farce of altruism.

If you can share your work with Big Mama, Big Mama can
share her satisfaction with you, a reciprocal arrangement.
Reciprocity, fairness, holding together is what this Women’s
Movement is about.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Lawsuit...

From Page 3

besieged by many of these
things. That men have more
opportunities than women is a
matter of opinion since the
average time for a girl here is
14 months and we have a low
recidivism rate of 6%. We feel
that we are doing a good job.

We have never lost a life here
for any cause. We're doing
what we can. We're not on the
defensive about the lawsuit -
we're not uptight about it.

Poor Medical Care
Specific charges in the
lawsuit include the following:
“Women have been denied and
are being denied necessary
medical care, resulting in
serious medical problems, the
full extent of which is not at
this time known to the
plaintiffs."" That is being inves-
tigated by a medical screening
arranged through the Medical
Committee for Human Rights.
Volunteer doctors, nurses and
clerical people will conduct
complete physical examina-
tions to gather data to clarify
the allegations. There have
been serious medical pro-
blems reported at the wo-
men’s facility such as persist-
ent bleeding that was seen as
“normal” by the staff physi-
cian and improper diet for a
diabetic woman who wasn’t
receiving the proper leafy
greens and protein she need-
ed. It seems that there is no
dietician at the prison, that
inmates are chiefly responsi-
ble for cooking food and that
often the specific items
are unavailable in the prison
kitchen resulting in unhealthy
substitutions.

According to Rudy San
Fellipo, the new Director for
the Department of Institu-
tions, medical care at Colora-
do State Penitentiary is “just
not adequate at all.”

But Ms. Gillespie, who is in
charge of the women’s facili-
ty, sees the medical screening
as “just another one of those
things...there is no special
reason they came down.” The
lawsuit states that the defen-
dants “have the power to
alleviate the conditions there
(at CWIC) but have not
exercised that power.”

Women prisoners are also
“denied the opportunity
granted other inmates to
participate in work-release
and pre-parole programs and
have less access to educa-
tional and vocational rehabili-
tative programs than the
general prison population.”
Since the suit was filed, some
women have been allowed
limited participation in pre-
parole activities. They can
now watch films and listen to
lectures on ways to readjust
to the outside, but women
cannot live in the pre-parole
center that is separated from
all other prison housing for a
month prior to their release as
men do. Instead, the women
in the pre-parole program are
forced to move to a separate
wing at CWCI and given “more
privileges, more freedom, and
possible furloughs” according
to Ms. Gillespie.

The academic program for
the women allows some to get
a high school equivalency
diploma and some to compete
with the general prison popu-
lation in competitive exams to
attend classes sponsored by
Southern Colorado State Col-
lege.

Unequal Pay

Another allegation in the
suit is that women are “paid
poorer wages for the work
they do in prison and they are
assigned duller, less useful,
and less rehabilitative jobs”
than are other inmates.
According to the women’s
warden the girls can “sew,
iron, cook, take business
classes and learn cosmetolo-
gy.” At the other facilities
(that are only for male
prisoners) there are such
“jobs” and “training” as
carpentry, machine shops,
mechanics, print shop, the
dairy and many more.

Women in the sewing
rooms at CWIC start at 15
cents a day and can earn up to
45 cents a day. The machines
are antiquated and aren't the
kinds of machines you would
have to know how to operate
to get a good job on the
outside. “The men use the
machines they send them over to us and
they’re all wrecked by that
time,” says an unidentified
inmate. “We sew shirts all day
for the men’s side and for all
the other state institutions.
For 15 cents a day. We work
just to keep this state going.”

The usual argument for
equal facilities for men and
women is that there are only
60 women in prison and 1250
men. But according to Joan
Tempko, the facilities should
be shared by both the men
and the women “we don’t
want separate but equal
facilities.”

Women have been and
continue to be arbitrarily pun-
ished for violating unwritten
rules of which they have never
been notified, according to
the suit. Violation of these
rules “are determined without
any due process guarantee,
but they are noted in the
prison records and may affect
the granting or denial of
parole” to women inmates.

Ms. Gillespie says: “We do
have now a set of overall rules
for everyone in the institution.
They are not approved as yet
but everyone is working on
them.” (What? -ed.)

Women supposedly are no
longer being written up for
violation of rules, but they are
still not told the consequences
of breaking certain rules,
according to Ms. Tempko of
the Law Collective.

No Body Contact

The women offenders are
given “less opportunity to
associate among themselves,
have shorter and more re-
stricted visiting hours and
have less of a chance to
associate with people outside
the prison than do other
inmates of the penitentiary.
The Associate Warden ex-
plains: “Visiting on weekends
is discouraged during the
week since programs at the
institution would be inter-
rupted.”

As far as visiting among
themselves, there is the no
body contact rule still in force
and it seems that the principle
reason for it is the fear of
homosexuality at the prison.
Ms. Gillespie says that “we
don’t have a real problem
{about Lesbianism)...we don’t
try to moralize about it at all.
Most of them are just
situational homosexuals
which may indicate a need for
affection, for someone to
care.”

Mail has allegedly been
censored and delayed without
regard for the feelings of
recipients. But the official
policy of the institution is that
mail is never censored, never
marked out or changed - just
read for “security reasons.”

The women do not have
access to a complete law
library or to jailhouse lawyers
as the rest of the prison
population does. The law
library that does exist in the
women's institution is “inad-
equate.”

The single nurse that works
at the women’s facility is only
there part of the day. At other
times “untrained, unqualified
staff dispense dangerous pre-
scription medicine. Since
inmates do not know what
medicine they are supposed
to be receiving, mistakes have
been made and will continue
to be made, with one inmate
being given the drugs pre-
scribed to a different inmate.”
Women are also “denied
access to the entertainment
and culture available to the
general prison population,
and the movies, cultural
programs and library books
which are available at CWIC
do not reflect the women’s
cultural backgrounds or suit
their tastes.”

It is because of the
separation on the basis of
their sex that the women in
the Colorado State Peniten-
tiary system are “subjected to
numerous rules and restric-
tions they otherwise would
not be, are treated like
children in an insulting and
degrading manner, and are
denied many comforts and
conveniences they would oth-
erwise enjoy.”"

and men prisoners practically
end here and this ending is
directly due to the sexism of
the patriarchy.

Laws themselves are based
on two different standards of
morality and behavior and
these built-in sex biases
determine the kinds of crimes
a woman is sentenced for and
the length of her sentence.
For example, a woman may be
prosecuted for prostitution
while her male solicitor is
rarely if ever taken to task.

In an article by Marie-An-
dree Bertrand entitled, “The
Myth Of Sexual Equality
Before the Law,” she con-
cludes that women are treated
more severely or more leni-
ently according to the social
value threatened by the
offense. A teenage woman,
for example, may be prose-
cuted for a crime such as
promiscuity while a young
man may often be charged
with crimes against property
such as vandalism or car
theft. He is prosecuted for an
offense against capitalism.
She is prosecuted for an
offense against the patriar-
chy.

Oftentimes, a woman will
be sentenced more harshly
than a man would be for the
same offense because the
misbehavior of women with
regard to certain crimes (such
as burglary or murder) is
considered more serious.
She, being a woman and the
so-called guardian of the
threatening the
entire fabric of society when

she behaves as violently as
men do. (Consequently, she is
locked up to relearn her
woman’s role which she has
stepped out of in this way.)
The kinds of crimes which
women do actually commit
most often are usually direct-
ed inward at themselves. In
the FBI’s Uniform Crime
Reports these crimes are
listed as theft, forgery,
prostitution, narcotics,
drunkenness, and disorderly
conduct. “Not only are these
the more subtle (more “femin-
ine”) forms of criminal behav-
ior, they are also the least
destructive of other persons
and property. Four of these
crimes are also referred to as
“crimes without victims”—
other than the doer. Women
are socialized to be passive,
to direct their energies in-
wards, towards themselves.
Therefore women, instilled
with a negative sense of self
(or no sense of self at all)
often turn to drugs and
alcohol for escape. For this,
women are either locked up in
a prison or more frequently
confined to mental institu-
tions. 

Once a woman has been
sentenced for any crime,
however, she is incarcerated
in an institution whose
primary purpose centers a-
round imposing and reinforc-
ing her typical feminine role.
What the outside patriarchal

world thinks she should be is
now carried out as law
the institution itself. Also,
because there are fewer

women in prison than men
and because it is generally
considered more important
that men be “rehabilitated,”
the little money which is
available for institutions us-
ually goes to the men.
Consequently, financial aid
for women’s programs is
relatively sparse.

The money which is availa-
ble to women’s prisons often
goes toward teaching the
woman certain vocations
which reinforce her stereo-
typed role and also are
practically useless to her in
surviving once she does get
released. At both Canon City
and the Denver County Jail,
for example, the women learn
(as if they didn’t already know
in the first place) to work in
the kitchen or in the laundry,
to sew, crochet, and knit, and
to do each other's hair! At
Canon City, women may also
learn clerical skills and there
is opportunity to get a high
school education, but at

Denver County the opportuni-
ty to get a high school degree
is sporadic,

depending on

whether a volunteer (from the
Opportunity School) is availa-
ble to teach the women.
Classes for women are few at
Canon City and non-existent
at Denver County.

At both prisons (and they
are by no means atypical of
women's prisons all over the
country) the emphasis again
is on reinforcing passivity.
Women are always referred to
as the “girls”—symbolizing
powerlessness, child-like
qualities, dependence etc. ad
nauseum.

Description and analysis of
women’s prisons and the
attitudes surrounding them
has been necessarily abridged
in this article because of
space limitations. A lot more
thought and action needs to
be focused on this area and in
the future BMR hopes to be
running more articles about
women in prison,

so well in her article on
“Women of the Convicted
Class,” in a society which, in
addition to being racist and
exploitative, is sexist, the

remind the reader that the
question of who will act is
crucial and is what has led to
the formation of independent
autonomous movements for
liberation. Everyone can talk
about oppression, but only
those most immediately af-
fected and committed will
actually seize the time and
know how and when to move
on their own liberation.”

Notes from A Woman...

extra for the guards to worry
about. So we got to have it.
During the picnic someone
took a tennis shoe and started
running around. We are never
allowed any horseplay but
when we all started running
around playing none of the
guards moved. This was when
the associate warden was
under pressure during the
investigations and I guess she
thought it would be better not
to do anything. And believe
me, there could have been
scores of male guards from
the medium security prison
that is just over the hill there
in a second if she wanted
them.

Getting It Together

When you first go down
there they give you education
tests. I got a high enough
score on the tests so that I
could take the GED. I had two
weeks to study for the test. At
first most of it is just
refreshing your memory. It
had been twelve years since
I'd been to school. Then
things got rougher academically
but I had this friend who
was my backbone. She would
help me when I got into a rut.
And with the help of Pam I
made it. She badgered me into
doing it.

Then I talked to the
counselor over at minimum
security and he showed me a
pamphlet by the University
Without Walls people who

~ program over at Metro
Heights College in Denver. I
was thinking of going to
Metro or Community College
but he told me about
scholarships for this program
so I applied. I got one of two
scholarships for women. I had
made it. It blew my mind. I
must have grinned for about a
week.

Things were happening to
me so fast. I was so full of
b.s. inside from the prison
that when this happened I felt
that I was really floating
around and it turns out to be
the best thing that ever
happened to me.

There is an inside team and
an outside team in the UWW
program. The inside team is
still in prison and the outside
team is people who are on
parole. So at the first session
of the whole program everybody
was together at Camp
George West which is in
Golden for classes. The other
woman who was in the
program and myself were
housed at Montview Girls’
School. I used to go back to
Montview at night with a
headache from absorbing so
much. I was learning at a rate
that I just couldn’t believe.

Since I grew up in the
streets I would respond
negatively and physically to
everything and everyone. Now
I was learning that I could
change things just by using
my head and that there were
resources available to me that
were dynamite and that gave
me the confidence that I
needed and the book learning
I needed.

When the session was over

and I had to go back to the
prison environment it was
really hard. The first time I
went to the prison I didn’t
know what was going on but
this time I did and it was so
hard for me and especially for
my family.

When I was back in the
structured environment one
thing that hit me was that if all
the inmates didn’t start
working together we wouldn’t
get anything done. Up until
now people were on a racial
trip. In the TV room the Blacks
would be together and the
Chicanas would be in a group
and the whites would stay
together. They would all
intermingle but it was an
obvious thing that they were
separate groups. So I became
aware (and so did some
others) that we were so busy
hassling each other that we
were going to stay in the same
rut.

Inmate Council

So some of us were elected
by the population to be in the
inmate council. At first we
wrote up a really formal thing
introducing ourselves to the
administration and trying to
get a better attitude going
between the guards and the
women inmates. The guards
tend to be really close-minded
to a lot of things - there is no
room for change with them.
They have set patterns they
stick to.

You start to act like a robot
here and before long you're
responding to buzzers to eat,
to sleep. That was basically
the rapport between the
administration and inmates.

So we started with menial
things, small rule changes
like being allowed to have
more clothes and picnics in
the yard. The associate
warden pretty mellow

came up with the idea for a
work-release program.

Everybody participated in
this proposal. I don’t think
that it ever happened before
that the whole prison popula-
tion participated in the same
thing and supported it and
really got behind it. Everyone
recognized the need. Espe-
cially the women who had
children and the women who
were federal prisoners who
were a long way from their
families or anybody who
could visit them.

The jobs that we had in the
prison were useless and
meaningless. You are just
working for the state making
shirts for the men in prison
and for patients at the state
hospitals. How much incen-
tive can a person get by
earning 15 to 40 cents a day?

We wrote up the proposal.
We had everything covered
down to where the partici-
pants would put their clothes
and what kind of transporta-
tion could be used. We
figured that the money we
made would be split up three
ways: one-third to the state
for our maintenance,
one-third to savings, and one-third
to the woman for her family.
We gave the proposal to May
Gillespie, the associate ward-
en. We gave her time to read it
(about two days) and waited
for an answer. We waited and
waited. We met with her but
she hadn’t read it yet. So we
waited another two weeks
and then hit her up with it
again. She had to say
something now. She said that
she was all for work-release
but that, you know, girls can
get pregnant. That was it. We
were stunned. I can’t recall
anyone’s expression because I
went into shock that she
would say that.

I think that for a long time
after that I thought “where's
this lady's head at?”

Gettin’ Out

The Inmate Council was
getting a lot of things together
and I applied for parole. I kind
of knew that if anybody had a
chance I did since I was
starting to get my head
together and responding to
things like the UWW program
and I don’t think that Ms.
Gillespie was comfortable
with that. To tell you the truth
I think that it scared the shit
out of her when she realized
that the inmate population
had a chance of getting it
together.

During that time I’m sure
she was under pressure
because the warden of the
prison had been suspended.
Oh that was the final reason
for no work-release program
because a permanent warden
hadn't been appointed. But
Alex Wilson has been the
warden for some time and I
still don’t see any work-re-
lease program for the women.

Anyway, I met with the
parole board on a Friday. It
usually takes about two weeks
to hear if you got it or not.
There's a lot of red tape to go
through and a lot of anxiety to
experience. But I got my
answer on Saturday the next
day and the board doesn’t
even work on Saturday. They
took me down to Canon City
to buy my clothes on that
Monday and on Tuesday I was

on my way to Denver. And,
what a coincidence, on the
next day (Wednesday) the
Grand Jury was down there to
talk to a lot of people. All I
know is that I would have had
a hell of a lot to say to them if
I would have been there.

When I got out it was really
a strange trip. I had been in
there 8½ months and my head
was pretty messed up. I love
my family very much and we
had always been close phy-
sically - hugging type people
and after I got out I would
really feel awkward every time
anyone would put their hands
on me. Sometimes I would
even pull away. I never
thought how important it is to
be able to touch somebody.

Right after I got out I started
school and I would be at the
school for an hour and then I'd
get this damndest insecure
feeling and I would have to go
home and sit there for a while.
There would be no reason for
this. I just needed to go home.
It took me a while to be able to
hug somebody and to be able
to let somebody kiss and hug
me or show some kind of
affection. I’m really glad that
I’m over that now.

It’s a good feeling to be able
to touch somebody. It’s part
of what we’re about - feeling
and loving and caring.

Thoughts From

Francis Howerton

We are trapped and weak
being consumed and set apart
from all other realities. One
may detect a sort of elated
atmosphere among us, but let
not your conceptions be
misdirected, my people: we
are restless and non-content
and merely exercising attri-
butes of our womanhood.

For we are the Queen
Mothers of this world, the
womb from which all civiliza-
tion emerged, and engulfed by
an ignorance so monstrous as
this system that the very
nature in which we were
created is denied us.

Some of us here now are

thoroughly pacified with the
systematic programming
methods of madness that this

instituted. Yet, many are
rebellious in their humility
and will not allow themselves
to be subjected to these
prophesized demons who
have altered our course with
mixtures of concrete and steel
and such a terrible shade of
gray.

On Thursday night before the Women's Festival, the Denver Women’s Center Coalition (DWCC) met to finalize plans for the Colorado Women's Festival and to make organizational decisions.  

It was decided that any funds from the Women’s Festival would be temporarily held until more definite plans could be made about the Denver Women’s Center. A temporary Women’s Center Council was chosen, made up of nine members--one from each of the six groups which were active organizing the festival, and three members to meet to make recommendations to the larger coalition on the following subjects: bylaws (or how decisions are made and by whom); statements of purpose (or what will the Women’s Center be and for whom); financial statements, incorporation, and criteria regarding who will be future members of the Women’s Center.  

An open meeting has been called for September 12, by which time the Council will present its reports to the coalition members, for discussion. The September 12 meeting will be held at 7:30 at the First Southern Baptist Church at 16th and Pearl.  

The groups which will be represented on a temporary council are: Rocky Mountain Women in the Arts, Herstory Theatre Group, Lesbian Task Force, Women in Transition, Big Mama Rag, and the Coalition Against Sexual Assault.  

A group for pre-orgasmic women is being formed beginning the third week of September. Call Jean Fortier at 831-7731, the Gestalt Institute for more information.

One Woman’s Personal Account

INTRODUCTION

There are some things that have to be said about class issues and they have to be said now. Some of us are getting hurt, a lot of us are getting angry, and it has to stop. What is happening is that middle - and upper-class sisters are laying heavy trips on working class women. I want to deal with that problem, and there is a lot to say about it. Most of it is painful, and more of it is easy. I am very grateful to Big Mama Rag for expressing an interest in class struggle and for allowing working class women the chance to be heard. Few others have listened at all.

I have decided, after a great deal of thought about it, to remain anonymous, for several reasons. First, I would be personally embarrassed for anyone to make special exceptions for me because of my struggles. Second, the purpose of this article is to reveal some of the gut issues of class struggle, not to air my personal grievances against an unjust society. Other opinions on the class issue as it relates to Feminism are wholeheartedly welcomed.

The only way I can deal with this issue is to draw on my own experience and consciousness. For me, this begins with an analysis of my childhood and what that has meant to my life.

I was plenty aware of class status when I was a kid, because we didn’t have any -- or if we did, it was at the very bottom. I grew up poor, the oldest of 4 children, in small midwestern farming towns. My father was a salesman and he never did very well until I was in high school and he and my mother started teaching school. Until then, we moved around a lot, like about once a year or more often. My mother worked at odd jobs, took in laundry and mending, and went to college part-time (when we had the money) while we were growing up, so that eventually she could bring in more money for our family. My mother was definitely from a working-class background, and my father was probably lower-middle-class because he was a preacher's son, even though his parents often struggled for survival, too.

Our family struggle while I was growing up was a determined one. The only real security we had was our love for each other, and even that grew thin at times, when we got really desperate. I never had enough to eat, and I remember there was at least one long stretch where all we had to eat was bread and milk, and we were glad for that. Often I had nothing to eat at school, even though there was hot lunch, because we couldn't afford it. We never went on welfare and I think the reason was either that we never knew it existed or if my father did know, he was too proud to have accepted it. It seemed there were a lot of times we nearly starved to death or thought we would, and I know we kids at least would have been glad for anything, no matter where it came from.

My parents had firm moral convictions and a firmly ingrained Puritan work ethic. Things like lying and stealing were punished severely, and I went through one long phase of stealing where I was black and blue all the time. There was never any play until the work was all done, never any liquor in the house, and we all went to church on Sundays unless somebody was sick, which was pretty often. Even so, we had a lot of fun making up silly games and just talking about things. No matter how bad things got, we weren't going to let it get us down if we could help it. These were some of the attitudes I grew up with that influenced me greatly.

But there were other influences at work, too, that were much more devastating in their effect, and much more insidious. Being poor meant mostly shame. I never had new clothes, except when my mother would “make something over” for me. My clothes were often too big or too little, and never in style. (I vaguely knew about style, but it never mattered much whether I did or not because we couldn't have afforded it anyway.)

As a child, I never understood why other kids wouldn't play with me and why their mothers wouldn't allow me to go to their kids’ houses. I knew it had something to do with our poverty, but I knew we weren’t “white trash” either. This enforced isolation had several effects on me. It hurt me deeply and probably forever, made me angry, made me feel ashamed and somehow “not good enough.”

I fought back with street words and often with my fists. I compensated in school by working hard and getting straight A's, and thereby won at least partial respect from my teachers. But I had practically no social life as a child. We moved too often, for one thing. And everywhere we went, I was avoided, ridiculed, and generally disliked for no reason that I could see. I remember being terribly confused at these cruel reactions from my classmates. In my own eyes and in the eyes of my family, I was a bright, sensitive, imaginative child who cared very much about other people. It was hard to understand why the love I gave so readily was returned with so much hostility, lies, ridicule, and fear.

At times I toughened myself. Other times I cried. Most of the time I was shy and defensive. I played with animals, who responded easily, made up games for myself and fantasies where I was a princess and all the other kids would treat me nice and bring me presents, and I learned nature. The out-of-doors was the only world I felt at ease in, because the sky and the earth and the silent growing things did not cast me out for any reason, let alone reasons I couldn't understand.

Sometimes my intense longing for friends, companionship, and conversation made me so desperate I would set out to “be accepted or else.” I would “show them” that I could “be somebody” too. And I would try to fix myself up as clean and neat as possible and politely ask somebody to come over to my house. And maybe they would, but mostly not. I would try so hard to be liked by them, I would do anything they wanted, even stupid, demeaning things. But it never really worked the way I always imagined it would.

I remember once someone I liked very much wanted me to steal some money for her out of the teacher's desk. She said if I would, she would buy me some candy after school. I fought with my conscience half the morning, and my conscience lost. I stole the money, thinking that at last maybe this was a way somebody would be friends with me. After school, we went down to the grocery store, and she said to pick out whatever I wanted. I chose carefully and took a long time (I hardly ever got to eat candy), while she was getting impatient and said to hurry up. I did, and we went to the counter to pay for it. She paid for hers, and then came a moment of revelation I will never forget as long as I live. She told the storekeeper that I was going to pay for my own, put the rest of the money in her pocket and ran out of the store yelling, “Sucker!”

I was so horrified and embarrassed that I dropped the candy and went outside and cried. I remember thinking how I had trusted her utterly and never once imagined that she could do anything so mean and cruel. I felt betrayed and cheated, and right then, in those first hot waves of anger, I began to see the source of all the injustice and cruelty. The real source was money, because money was power, and I had none.

As a child, I saw quite clearly a world where there was no entrance for me. So many times I wanted to scream, “How do I make you see that I am a person worth listening to, worth loving? Why can’t you put away your self-importance and recognize my right to human dignity?” But I wouldn't have known how to say it then, and I was laughed at so often that I only felt it would be useless.

I was taught by my parents that the only way to overcome all the problems facing me in my life was to go to college, and I was convinced at a very early age that a college education was the only answer to an otherwise certain future of desolation and

Analysis

Part 1

Why this personal account is important Although the trend is beginning to change, the women we hear from most are women from middle and upper class backgrounds. What about the real majority of women in the country -- the workers (and women who were raised in lower and working class families)? While one woman's struggle, as told here, does not purport to be representative of all working class or poverty backgrounds, its validity lies in the fact that her experiences, attitudes, and pain are a bond she shares with other working class women and which she does not share with women from other class backgrounds. We seldom hear what that feels like or how those experiences work in interaction among women. We know that experiential differences can keep us apart without us consciously realizing it. (Think for a minute who your closest friends are and what kind of background they have. Chances are, if their backgrounds are similar to yours, that you will see the truth of that statement.) We have to learn what there is about class attitudes and differences that keeps us apart, so that we can work to change things in ourselves that are destructive, and so we can understand and work with one another. This personal account is not just somebody's “sob story.” It should be the starting point for serious thought about what's going on in the feminist movement and why so many women feel excluded or alienated.

Women as a Caste

Just as problems among women from different class backgrounds create tension among us, we have to realize that this is all part of a larger oppression of women as an inferior caste in the patriarchal structure. Any perspective on class issues in the feminist movement must have as a reference point the fact that women are oppressed first as women and secondarily for their class background, among other things, such as their race or sexual preferences.

Some of the Problems

In thinking and talking about class and caste issues, women will be criticized for creating schisms in the women’s community. The problem is that they are already there.

Another problem is that in looking at value systems, we tend to make broad generalities, categorize and classify, in order to reach some of the causes of class problems. In the initial stages, we may fail to recognize that through raised consciousness, some women have managed to overcome the values, restraints, and/or oppression of their class backgrounds, and I think that is beautiful. But on the other hand, it’s very easy to think, “Well, they're not talking about me because I’m an exception,” and too often that’s just a cop-out. What

9/6/74  
Dear Big Mama:

I am writing to protest the  
outrageous management of  
the 1st Annual Women's  
Festival at East High August  
25th. Many active women took  
time and energies from other  
pressing duties to see that  
this event was successful,  
especially in terms of funds  
being raised to make a  
women’s center a reality in  
Denver. These same women  
are pretty disappointed to find  
that this effort failed, largely  
through the irresponsible be-  
havior of a few.

First of all, commitments  
were made to individuals and  
groups without the knowledge  
or approval of the festival  
committee. Such as: (1) It had  
been clearly understood prior  
to the festival that all  
concessions would be operated  
solely by the festival  
committee, but two concession  
booths were admitted against  
any knowledge of the  
majority of women. This was a  
tragic blunder, as these  
booths competed directly with  
the main concessions stand  
whose intake after expenses  
went 100% to the Women’s  

Center Coalition. (2) Public  
statements were made to the  
effect that any group which  
had a booth at the festival  
would automatically become  
members of the Women’s  
Center Coalition. These  
statements were made irre-  
sponsibly in that they did not  
have the approval of the  
festival committee, and in  
fact, most members opposed  
such an idea as it did not  
allow each group to even  
CHOOSE whether they wanted  
to be part of the Coalition!  
These and other statements of  
a similar nature went a long  
way to undermine the good  
faith of the women who  
participated. (3) The admit-  
tance of such groups as  
Together Books, RIP Book-  
store, and even the “surprise”  
concessions, which under no  
circumstances could be called  
“women's organizations”,  
made it totally impractical if  
not impossible for REAL  
women's organizations to sell  
books and other materials at  
their booths and thereby  
possibly raise funds for  
themselves and for the festival  
(i.e., Women's Center).

In the planning of this  
festival, there has been a  

consistent disregard (by the  
“leadership”) for our clearly  
articulated demands for total  
accountability of everyone  
involved in the decision-mak-  
ing process. Decisions were  
consistently made by the few  
without the knowledge or  
approval of the many.  
Attempts at organization  
and communication were re-  
peatedly made by BMR, the  
Lesbian Task Force of  
N.O.W., and some other  
individuals, in the hopes of  
preventing the types of idiocy  
mentioned above. That these  
attempts only partially suc-  
ceeded is a damning fact.  
However, I am less con-  
cerned about who did what,  
than I am with the process of  
this festival. That it even came  
off at all is a thing to be proud  
of, and I do not intend to  
minimize ANYONE’S part.  
What I object to so much is  
the lack of trust between us,  
which dictates that when one  
woman makes a mistake, she  
feels afraid to admit it openly  
and share that learning  
process with others. She  
starts dealing with other  
women in the ways that she  
deals with men, excusing  

herself because of her ignor-  
ance, which is a cop-out that  
WORKS with men because  
they expect that from women.  
But BETWEEN women it is  
dishonest and dangerous.  
Any woman who needs to fall  
back on old patterns and  
processes is denying herself  
the most important experi-  
ences she may ever have --  
sharing and learning on a gut  
level with other women,  
helping and BEING helped.  
So: to the extent that we were  
not using female processes,  
we were managing the  
festival.

This is an oppressive thing  
that we do to ourselves and to  
each other all the time. WE  
ALL HAVE TO BE MORE  
OPEN TO CRITICISM FROM  
EACH OTHER SO THAT WE  
CAN HELP EACH OTHER  
GROW* EVEN IF THAT  
GROWTH IS PAINFUL BE-  
CAUSE OF OUR MISTAKES.  
I am more willing to learn if  
I know there is love, and that is  
what we have to start trusting  
if we are to build a strong and  
vital women’s community in  
Denver. The lessons from this  
festival have been hard; we  
cannot afford to ignore them.  
We all have to do some  
serious thinking about unifi-  
cation and goals in the  
coming months; in the  
process, let’s not repeat  
ourselves. In the process, let’s  
see that our learning is open,  
so that we can all share.

In love and struggle,  
Shecat

To The Denver Post:

This letter is being written  
in objection to your article on  
Big Mama Rag on page 3 of  
Sunday, September 8, 1974,  
Denver Post. The article was  
obviously biased, prejudiced  
and sexist in content, reflect-  
ing Mr. Goldman's personal  
fears. I hardly considered the  
article as objective reporting,  
and was surprised and dis-  
mayed that the Denver Post  
would even print it.

Mr. Goldman seemed to  
feel that since BMR was by  
women for women that it was  
“out to get” men. I have a  
close male friend who reads  
every issue which comes out.  
He does not feel that the  
paper is “out to get” him and  
even finds it enlightening.  
Besides, there are several  
dozens of exclusively men's  
magazines on the newsstands  
today, men are highly involved  
in many of the more tradition-  
al women’s magazines, and  
for hundreds of years men  
controlled who could read and  
write. So why is Mr. Goldman  
so fearful of one struggling  
women's newspaper?

Much was also made of Ms.  
Waters' statement that she  
was “indifferent” to men as if  
her indifference was both  
criminal and reflective of the  
attitude of BMR. Man's  
history shows he has been  
“indifferent” to women for  
thousands of years if not  
unjust, cruel, hateful and  
inhuman. And if BMR, or its  

staff, are “out to get” men,  
how can they also be  
“indifferent”? It seems incon-  
sistency is a male trait, too.

Last spring, a friend of mine  
became involved with BMR on  
a volunteer basis and then  
became one of the paid staff  
members, so I have been  
informed of the basic changes  
and objectives of BMR. Big  
Mama Rag was originally  
structured in a traditional  
manner and eventually many  
of the women involved felt a  
need for restructuring along  
less traditional lines. Through  
a desire to represent all  
women, the many women  
involved with BMR cooperated  
in love and understanding to  
create the present structure.  
My friend is now a coordina-  
tor, which precisely describes  
her activities and all women  
who wish to may help decide  
which articles are printed in  
BMR. The paper is not  
controlled by a minority few  
as Mr. Goldman stated.

Finally, Mr. Goldman re-  
sorted to Lesbian baiting by  
reporting that BMR was  
controlled by Lesbians  
preaching separatism. Over  
the past several months, I  
have met and known many of  
these women and I find them  
intelligent, creative and with a  
high, positive energy level.  
When I am with them, I  
experience a warm loving that  
accepts me and all those  
around them for who we are.  
Never during my acquaintance  
with these women have any of  
them approached me and  
preached separatism.

Since one of the more basic  
endeavors of the Women’s  
Movement is for women to  
define herself, it is my belief  
that Lesbian women may be  
best able to do this. The  
Lesbian woman is totally  
involved with and dedicated to  
women and is woman defining  
woman.

No, I am not a Lesbian, but I  
am a budding Feminist who  
cares about and loves my  
sisters. When Mr. Goldman  
attempted to discredit Big  
Mama Rag and those con-  
nected with it, he also  
attempted to discredit all  
women. This has gone on far  
too long and men had best  
realize it before he destroys  
himself.

Sincerely yours,  
Barbara A. Main

Poverty. I was literally driven
by my fears to achieve as high
a goal as I could set for
myself, and I knew from the
beginning that I would have to
do it alone. There would never
be money in our family for
college, yet it was my parents’
burning hope that each of us
would go.

In my head, if I did not go to
college, it would mean that I
would never have friends,
never make a decent living,
and there was a very real fear
of starving to death in
loneliness and disgrace. (The
thing about friends was really
interesting. I thought for
many years that the only way
I would ever have friends was if
somehow I could get money
to buy nice clothes and live in
a nice house. I thought having
friends meant that you had to
have money, because that was
the message I was getting
loud and clear. This associa-
tion got me into a lot of
trouble with myself and
others, because at those rare
times when I did have a little
money, I often used it to try to
“buy” friends, and it wasn’t
until I saw that I was getting
ripped off and used that I
knew it wasn’t just the money
that was power; it was
everything that came with
money, and again I knew I was
still on the losing end of it.)

Because no one had ever
helped me before, with money
or making friends, I simply
assumed that no one ever
would. I made self-reliance a
supreme virtue, and some-
where in that process I went
through a “sour grapes” trip. I
decided that the virtues of
achievement were better than
the virtues of money (which
was actually correct thinking
but for all the wrong reasons
then), and I determined that I
would “be somebody” so
great that everyone would
have to respect me whether I
had money or not. I would
become famous (just as soon
as I worked out all the details).

All my hopes lay in the
future, and I worked very hard
to get there. I still struggled
for acceptance and friends,
but mostly to survive. I grew
up strong by myself, dream-
ing dreams of myself the way
I wanted to become, not once
thinking of failure. There was
no question in my mind that I
would make it: I had to. The
only alternative was death in

one form or another, and
since I was already living
through a very real social

“death”, no alternatives but
success were acceptable to
me. There was only one way
out, and I would get there no
matter what. The worse things
got, the harder I worked. At
the age of 11 I went to work for
real.

With my first job, at 11
years of age, came a growing
awareness of another nasty
little thing the world can
throw a person: the concept
of the inferiority of woman-
kind. I was surprised I hadn't
noticed it before, but there it
was, bigger than life.

I worked in the fields,
hoeing weeds out of bean
fields, shoveling manure, and
tending livestock. There were
a lot of things I wasn’t allowed
to do because I was a girl, and
that really made me mad. I
was taller, stronger, and
faster than any boy in my
class, and since the argument
used against “heavy” work
was that I might hurt myself,
it didn’t make any sense at all.

I set out to really prove
myself, and before long I was
working on a pony farm, doing
everything no one else wanted
to do. I threw bales, cleaned
tack (bridles, saddles, har-
ness, etc.), groomed horses
and trimmed hooves, mixed
grain, all kinds of things.
Most of the work was fun
because I felt I was helping
the animals to have a better
life, and that made me feel
good. But a lot of it was dirty
and hard, and I wondered if
“proving myself” had been
such a good idea; I was being
used in the worst way. I made
about 25 cents an hour and I
never saw a penny of it. It
went to put food on our family
table. (The most I ever made
until I was out of high school
was 85 cents an hour, and that
was working 12 to 16 hours a
day in the fields, doing
backbreaking work with only
one break, which lasted as
long as it took to eat whatever
lunch I had.)

And I did get hurt some at
my first job; a stack of bales
fell on me once, I got kicked
frequently, and several times I
was jumped on by ponies or
trampled. I never complained
to anybody, though, because
if I did I would lose my job,
and we needed the money;
also, I was learning a lot, and
that was very valuable to me. I
was only 13 then.

Since the day I first started
working, I haven't stopped.
After a while, I got to keep
some of the money, which
was great except that I used it
all wrong. At first I didn’t
realize that it was mine
because I had earned it. I
thought it was like a present
or something, and I spent it all
right away, or gave it to
someone who said they
needed it, or bought things for
other people. My parents
encouraged me to save, but it
was always such a pitiful
amount that it never seemed
to grow fast enough and there
was always something I
needed. It seemed impossible
that I would ever have
anything really big from what
I had earned, so I used it for my
own material comforts or
shims of the moment. That
seemed perfectly logical to
me, but my parents criticized
me sharply for wasting money
on things that weren’t abso-
lutely necessary. A lot of
times I listened to them, but
more often I felt that I
deserved to spend my money
any way I wanted since I'd
worked so hard to earn it.
Sometimes I felt terribly
selfish, though, for spending
money just for myself when
the rest of my family was just
as bad off as I was, and I felt
very guilty because I didn’t
share as much as I thought I
should. The fact that there
wasn’t much to share didn’t
make any difference; I was
used to that by then.

When I finally got into high
school, I discovered several
unique ways to achieve a
small amount of popularity.
The other kids were starting to
think about college then, and
since I got good grades, I
began to be “useful” at last by
helping other kids with their
school work. I was totally
aware that I was being used,
and why, but I was so glad for
some social contacts that I
didn’t care too much. Then in
our state, girls’ athletics were
very popular, and since I was
pretty good at sports, I made
varsity on all the teams and

made some friends that way.
But I was seldom asked out on
dates or to parties, and I still
felt very keenly the ostracism
of my classmates. I just
wasn’t “in”, and it was the
same story all over again. I
had no close friends, no one I
could really talk to or who
even seemed to care very
much whether I existed or not.
I worked harder than ever and
dreamed my dreams of col-
lege and future success.

The time finally came and I
was accepted to the college of
my choice, a medium-sized
state school with a good
reputation and low tuition,
and I nervously awaited to
hear about scholarships. The
college didn’t help me, but my
high school teachers did, and
I was so pleased and
embarrassed at the time I
thought I'd faint. It was only
$100, but that was a fortune to
me. I applied for work and a
government loan for the rest,
and that came through, too,
which seemed like a miracle
to me. I didn’t think I deserved
such good luck.

There I was at a major
turning point in my life -- with
the tool of college within my
reach, I was ready to build a
secure future and bury my
past forever. But I hadn't
counted on a lot of unexpect-
ed problems. Like sororities
and the incredible elitism bred
of the assumed superiority of
the middle and upper classes.
Like the fact that all the things
I thought to free myself from
confronted me more power-
fully than ever, with pressures
to conform to values I only
knew from the wrong side of
the tracks.

The things that still counted
with my classmates in college
were things I still did not
have: money, social standing,
good communication skills,
popularity. Time and again I
came across the power that
money has, when all my
friends would go out to eat, or
go shopping, or plan trips.
That was all totally impossible
for me. With stars in my eyes,
I made a bad mistake right
away. I went out for rush,
hoping to find sisterhood and
friendship with other women
in a close-knit group. The
entire process sickened me.
At rush parties I was greeted
with politeness and that was
all. My clothes were in
impossibly “poor taste”
(which was not at all
humorous to me), my man-
ners were not like anyone
else’s, and I was obviously an
“outsider” by my appearance
alone. I could not help that,
but I think then that that was
my last stand against being
judged on someone else’s
terms alone.

Others could talk about the
big money projects they were
involved in, or the car they
were going to get when they
graduated, or the house they
were going to buy, or the
clothes. All I could talk about
was if I had enough money to
eat for the rest of the week,
because that was on my mind
a lot. A lot of times I was
broke by Thursdays, and I
really tried to stretch my
money out, too. The differ-
ence between me and the
other people I knew was that
when my money was gone,
there was no more, period.
Being broke for me meant flat
broke, which, I discovered,
did not mean the same thing

has to happen is for every
woman to reexamine her
entire value system, its
origins and present validity,
especially in terms of how she
relates to other women.

Another problem is that, in
the beginning of any dialogue
in relation to class, all these
angers start pouring out from
women at all levels, and in
trying to deal with the anger,
which is also valid, we get
personally defensive & side—
tracked from getting to the
real reason for everyone's
anger and tension. I really feel
that until we deal with the
reasons, we will never be able
to deal with our class
problems as sisters and begin
to relate to one another in a
freeing, supportive way. I
want us to get beyond the
issues that divide us, and in
order to do that, I think we
have to cut through all our
defenses and conditioning
and get down to gut level,
where there is pain. It would
be good to explore the pain we
share and the causes of it.
This must be done in honesty
with ourselves, and it must
begin there.

Just the fact that there ARE
angers should indicate that
the issue has not been
resolved. As a rule, when
there is anger, it means either
that someone has not lis-
tened, or that someone has
not said what they really feel.
It is time to hear what women
are angry about in terms of
class -- it’s time to get it out in
the open so that we can deal
with it and get beyond it.

I believe in women; I
believe in our strength and our
power of understanding, and I
trust in the truth of our pain.
What women need to do more
and more is to seek their roots
and to find in those roots
validity and dignity. No one
need be ashamed of the way
they were brought up; where
there is need for shame is
when we use our experiences
(or privileges) against one
another. Solving the problems
of class and caste is a giant
step toward sisterhood. That
step must be taken now, and
we must all take it together.

Part 2

The primary factors that
determine a person’s class
identity are:

1. THE WORK SHE DOES:

The bulk of work working
class women do is service,
factory, or office work, most
often low-paying and with
little hope for advancement. If
she has a family, she must
work two jobs: one in her
home and one in the labor
force. Work is a necessity for
her, not an option. The bulk of
work middle class women do
is managerial, professional,
or volunteer. For middle class
women, their work is not a
material necessity but an
attempt to achieve fulfillment
or escape boredom under the
illusion that somehow their
jobs are beneficial to the
world.

2. HER BACKGROUND:

The working class back-
ground: A woman growing up
in a working class family
knows what it is like to have
material needs. Her labor
power is important from the
time she is small, and often
she begins supporting herself
while still in her teens.
Schools and parents try to

Page 3

channel her into learning
practical skills for survival
such as home-ec and secre-
tarial skills, rather than
college-prep courses. If she
rebels against this, she learns
no skills and must work at the
lowest-paying, non-skilled
jobs or resort to prostitution.
If she aspires and goes on to
college, she finds it a
constant struggle. Because
she lacks the right contacts,
she has great difficulty
learning about loans and
scholarships and receives
little help finding employment
after graduation.

The middle class back-
ground: A woman growing up
in a middle class family learns
the skills necessary to “make
it” in the system. She learns
the proper ways of speaking
and relating to people. She
develops self-confidence
through the security of her
social environment. She is
assured of a college educa-
tion, learns what is expected
of her, and is promised a
social position. She has the
luxury of sampling the latest
fads, experimenting with dif-
ferent life-styles, or doing
things just for the experience,
because she knows that she
can always get money from
her parents if she needs it.
When she takes a low-paying
job, it is temporary because
she has the skills, contacts
and education to either find
another job or to align herself
with a middle class man.

3. HER RELATIONSHIP WITH
MEN:

This is the most important
determinant of class identity.
The economic class system is
a hierarchy of power among
men. A woman's class identi-
ty is determined by her
relationship to men: first by
her father, later by her
husband. The higher up her
man is in the class hierarchy
the more she benefits from
the system. The wife of a
middle class man need not
work for her survival outside
of her home because she is
provided for by her husband.
She is economically depend-
ent on him. The wife of a
working class man is forced to
be economically dependent
upon herself. The family
cannot make ends meet on the
husband’s income alone.

The single woman is obvi-
ously working class (ignoring
a few token exceptions)
because women are the
lowest paid workers. Any
woman who is economically
self-dependent rather than
male-dependent lives in the
material reality of the working
class regardless of her back-
ground.

To conclude, the most
general definition of a working
class woman is one who is
economically self-dependent.

Part 3

At the Big Mama Rag
meetings on class-consciousness very little progress
was made in developing cre-
ative theory and action pro-
grams. Every time a working-
class woman began to relate
her pain about her class
oppression, such as the
printed personal account in
this issue, a middle-class
woman would reply that she
was not responsible. She was
not an oppressor, she was not

The Denver Post in its issue of Sunday, September 8, published a feature article about Big Mama Rag. The article, in the best tradition of patriarchal arrogance, was a smear intended to discredit not only BMR but the women’s community of Denver and the entire Feminist movement. It is important to realize that the Post article, as written, passed the editor's desk with an okay for publication. This must be recognized as the attitude and position of The Denver Post toward Feminism.

Utilizing tactics of classism, Lesbian-baiting, out-of-context quotes, rampant misrepresentation of facts and innuendo, the article portrayed our women’s newspaper as a narrow-interest publication. (Fact: BMR provides national, regional, and local coverage relating to Feminist theory, women's poetry, women’s health, welfare rights and legislation, Lesbian issues, book reviews, NOW activities, union women's activities, media analysis and community announcements.) By the time UPI had “whispered down the aisle” a Philadelphia radio station named Chocolate Waters as the editor when in fact we have none, and a Houston newspaper called Ronnie Martin the only man on our staff, when in fact we have none.

It is apparent that the Post has at last felt the power and influence of a growing and active women’s community in this city; felt it as a threat. And rightly so. A recent Denver Post devoted four of its eighty-eight pages to women’s news. Over 50% of this space was given to advertising. The copy included fashion news, engagement announcements, news of a home decorators show and Ann Landers’ column, with less than one page of articles actually relevant to women as women.

Reacting out of fear, The Denver Post is contributing strongly to an already hostile political climate in Denver. As the women's movement grows this type of counter-action can be expected to increase. It is important that we have a clear understanding of what is happening and that we not be intimidated or divided by the defensiveness and smear attempts we will encounter.

The Post, realizing the necessity and power of effective communication to a growing movement, made an attempt to cut the heart out of Denver Feminism. By striking at what it considered to be the soft underbelly of Feminism (Lesbianism), the Post attempted to destroy one of our major exchange mediums and thus seriously curtail Feminist communication in Denver.

Through letters to the editor and cancellation of subscriptions we can show the Post (and other media interests) that the Denver women’s community cannot be so easily trampled or brushed aside.

The Post has performed two invaluable services for Denver Feminists: first, it has clearly revealed the position and depth of resistance we must overcome in order to realize Feminist principles in Denver; secondly, it has shown us the type of tactics which will be used against us; i.e., name-calling and traditional appeals to the standard bigotry against anyone who is not white, not male, not middle class and not supporting patriarchy.

To the Man Reporter from the Denver Post

Chocolate Waters

I knew from the start it was a mistake to talk to you—

Six Radical Feminists and the Man of the Press and his frightened photographer with the evil eye.

Even with those odds we were outnumbered.

But you expected us to be reasonable to defer to you as a man and a member of the Almighty Male Media to explain our position logically, to smile a lot.

After all we are living in a civilized world:

RECALL a picture of a woman hunched up on top of her knees, her mouth awry, the red blood rolling around her ankles like falling red stones with nowhere to go.

She is naked.

She is also dead.

The victim of an “abortionist” who already had all the money she could borrow tucked inside his shirt pocket when he left her there.

RECALL the housewife married 25 years to a man who called her Lard Butt because she ate a lot remembering the time when she had no food because her alcoholic father drank it all up. Married to a man who wanted to punch her frequently for being “stupid” and often did, then sat at his supper table like a king saying, “The potatoes are lumpy. You've burned the roast. and I’M the one who likes cream in my coffee.” We see it every day on TV - only in your version she’s the buffoon.

RECALL a young woman in the dormitory of a midwestern university lying unobtrusively on the floor with a broom handle rammed so murderously up between her legs that her intestines were hanging out her mouth like tiny penises in reminder—

It was not an isolated incident.

RECALL an old woman run over under the wheels of an Army truck driven by a young GI who could’ve been anybody's brother. Fleeing from her burning hut, she was a gook and the Enemy anyway; the story wasn't newsworthy.

RECALL a Lesbian woman whose face was torn apart by the irate husband of a straight friend. He claimed she had designs on his woman over coffee. She took the case to court.

“Are you a Lesbian?” the judge said. “Yes,” she said.

“Case dismissed,” he said. He didn’t say it would've been just as OK had he killed you. (The story did not make front-page news).

RECALL the 19th century sailors who captured an island full of Polynesian women - dragged them on their ships and brutalized and raped them, then tossed them overboard to drown. And when to the men’s surprise the women swam, the sailors shot them through the heads for sport with bullet holes arranged by one click of one finger pulled through weapons resembling pricks and talking louder.

It only took us 200 years to find this out.

RECALL NINE MILLION WOMEN tortured individually as witches over a period of FOUR HUNDRED YEARS which we never read three lines about in all your scholarly history books.

RECALL the disc jockeys of Every Major City in This Country who laugh at women 100 times a broadcast: “I was going to do a bit about the groupie as bowwow, but I lost the dog...” or “And there we have Helen Reddy singing ‘I Am Woman,’ the national anthem of Women’s Lib - Can you imagine saluting a broad on a flagpole?...”

Can you imagine a woman doing any of these things?

Because she hates men as you and your kind have hated women since the beginning of the time you first appeared on this earth?

Yet there you sit in your 20th century casuals—casually—with a notebook in your hands. Your hands writing busily. Your hands that are so clean they never dirty anything more than newsprint. Your mouth working rapidly. In the midst of six women-identified-women you say, “So first you get freedom for Blacks, then for women, then for Lesbians, then for rapists, then for axe-murderers. Now isn’t that carrying the argument to absurdity?”

Well, of course not. Anyone knows that it is completely reasonable to classify Lesbians with axe-murderers (though personally I have never known either a rapist or an axe-murderer who was a woman).

So we don’t smile at you. And you are shocked when we talk about the “boys and their games” (and you think THAT'S discrimination!)

Shocked when we say we are indifferent to you.

So shocked that you are compelled to write about “Lesbian bombardment and man-hating polemics.”

After you’ve said that the “women with beehive hairdos are really the enemy.” (You should look to your own polemics.)

The night after your article appeared in the Denver Post someone called me on the phone and said,

“Are you that man-hating lezzy Chocolate Waters? You're the one I want. I'm going to rape you and murder you.”

Six months ago someone called my sister on the phone 1600 miles away. She is not a Lesbian. She is not even quite a woman yet.

The voice said,

“Is your name Tena Waters? You're the one I want. I'm going to rape you and murder you.”

Neither voice belonged to a woman wearing a beehive hairdo...

Colorado Labor Union Women Move to  
Organize the Unorganized.

Women trade unionists  
from as diverse unions as the  
United Rubber Workers, the  
American Federation of  
Teachers, the Amalgamated  
Clothing Workers and the  
American Postal Workers Un-  
ion met together September  
14 to found the Denver chapter  
of the Coalition of Labor  
Union Women (CLUW).

CLUW was founded at a  
national convention in Chica-  
go in March of this year where  
3,200 union women from 58  
national and international  
unions attended. The stated  
purposes of the organization  
are to increase women’s  
participation in their unions,  
to press for reforms for  
women through legislative  
and political action, to initiate  
affirmative action programs  
and to aid in the organizing of  
unorganized women into the  
union movement.

Since the founding conven-  
tion, women in New York, De-  

troit, Seattle, Washington  
D.C., Los Angeles and other  
cities across the country have  
successfully held founding  
conferences to establish local  
CLUW chapters. The signifi-  
cance of the organization lies  
in the fact that it brings many  
of the issues raised by the  
women’s liberation movement  
into the realm of working  
women who up until now have  
often felt that the women’s  
movement was not concerned  
with their problems. The  
Coalition hopes to give rank  
and file union women a voice  
in their unions and on their  
jobs.  
The September 14 Denver  
meeting drew about 60 women  
from about 25 different locals  
in the area. The meeting laid  
out the basic purpose of the  
organization, described the  
procedure necessary to be-  
come a chartered CLUW  
chapter, and began a discus-  
sion of the difficulties faced in  

COALITION OF LABOR UNION WOMEN  
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE  

(As adopted at the founding  
conference, March 23-24)

Of the 34 million women in  
the work force-- little more  
than four million women are  
members of unions. It is  
imperative that within the  
framework of the union move-  
ment, we take aggressive  
steps to more effectively  
address ourselves to the  
critical needs of 30 million  
unorganized sisters and to  
make our unions more re-  
sponsive to the needs of all  
women, especially the needs  
of minority women who have  
been singled out for particu-  
larly blatant oppression.

Women unionists work in  
almost every industry, in  
almost every part of the  
country. Despite their geo-  
graphical, industrial and oc-  
cupational separations, union  
women share common con-  
cerns and goals.

Full equality of opportuni-  
ties and rights in the labor  
force require the full attention  
of the labor movement...and  
especially, the full attention  
of women who are part of the  
labor movement.

The primary purposes of  
this new national coalition is  
to unify all union women in a  

viable organization to deter-  
mine, first - our common  
problems and concerns, and,  
second - to develop action  
programs within the frame-  
work of our unions to deal  
effectively with our object-  
ives. Through unity of pur-  
pose, the Coalition of Labor  
Union Women will seek to  
accomplish these goals. We  
recognize that our struggle  
goes beyond the borders of  
this nation and seek to link up  
with our working sisters and  
brothers throughout the world  
through concrete action of  
international workers’ solidar-  
ity.  
ORGANIZING THE  
UNORGANIZED WOMEN  

Since less than twelve  
percent of the women in  
today’s labor force are en-  
rolled in labor unions, it is  
obvious that most working  
women are suffering eco-  
nomically. Statistics clearly  
demonstrate that the union  
member enjoys higher wa-  
ges, better fringe benefits and  
working conditions and great-  
er job security than the unor-  
ganized worker. The Coalition  
of Labor Union Women seeks  
to promote unionism and to  
encourage unions to be more  

aggressive in their efforts to  
bring unorganized women  
under collective bargaining  
agreements, particularly in  
those areas where there are  
large numbers of unorganized  
and/or minority women.  
CLUW will seek to create a  
greater awareness of the  
benefits of union member-  
ship. Within our intra-, inter-,  
and emerging union structure,  
we will work to encourage  
non-union women to join us in  
the trade union movement.  
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN  
THE WORKPLACE  
Employers continue to pro-  
fit by dividing workers on  
sexual, racial and age lines.  
This encourages the segrega-  
tion of job classifications and  
results in wage and benefit  
losses to women. The power  
of unions must increasingly  
be brought to bear, through  
the process of collective  
bargaining, to correct these  
inequities. The Coalition will  
seek to encourage women,  
through their unions, to  
recognize and take positive  
action against job discrimina-  
tion in hiring, promotion,  
classification and other as-  
pects of work. Women must  
learn what their rights are  

under the law. They must  
become more knowledgeable  
of the specifics of collective  
bargaining and of the contract  
clauses and workplace  
practices which discriminate  
against them. They must be  
informed about what is and  
can be done within the labor  
movement to correct these  
situations. We seek to edu-  
cate and inspire our union  
brothers to help achieve  
affirmative action in the  
workplace.  
POLITICAL ACTION  
AND LEGISLATION  

It is imperative that union  
women, through action pro-  
grams of the Coalition,  
become more active partici-  
pants in the political and  
legislative processes of our  
union and our unions. Move-  
ment for full employment, and  
job opportunities, shorter  
work week without loss of  
pay, child care legislation, a  
livable minimum wage for all  
workers, improved maternity  
and pension benefits, im-  
proved health and safety  
coverage, expanded educa-  
tional opportunities, mass  
action for final ratification of  
the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA), guaranteed collective  

bargaining rights for all  
workers, the right to strike  
and an extension of truly  
protective legislation for all  
workers are only a few of the  
political action programs in  
which CLUW must partici-  
pate. Whenever and wherever  
possible CLUW urges all  
women to seek election to  
political office.  
PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN  

WITHIN THEIR UNIONS  

The Coalition seeks to  
inspire and educate union  
women to ensure and  
strengthen their participation,  
through full and complete  
democratic procedures, to  
encourage their leadership  
and their movement into  
policy-making roles within  
their own unions and within  
the union movement in all  
areas. The Coalition supports  
the formation of women’s  
committees and women's  
caucuses within trade unions  
wherever necessary."

Artemis

As our consciousness is being collectively raised by one
another; as we fill a womanspace fuller of our needs in areas like
midwifery, herbery, music, art; as we come closer each day to
what it truly is to be women, it strikes me funny that we are
ignoring a basic part of that journey -- total health.

I'm speaking about going beyond self-examinations,
home-deliveries and herbal medicine. To Being exactly what the
Great Mother Goddess made us to be in every way. I won't
elaborate on that idea as a whole now, however I do want to deal
with one specific.

Smoking, no matter how you look at it, is destructive, not
only to the individual doing it but all who are in her vicinity.

I would like to take issue with the politics behind cigarette
smoking. First and foremost it’s the Man's vice, designed to be an
eternal profit maker for such war mongers as American Tobacco
Company. One of the many legal vices that the people empty their
pocketbooks over the privilege of consuming. Second, it’s a
pacifier, one of the many offered to us from birth, rubber
pacifiers, suckers -- to keep us in our place, keep us from
speaking up, giving us a false sense of security. Third, it keeps
hands busy, more often than not, too busy to be doing more
constructive things. Many manage to smoke and perform a myriad
of tasks at the same time, little realizing what a psychic drain it is
to be doing two or more things at a time.

Cigarettes have the curious property of being a stimulant
and a depressant at the same time. Although not a stimulant in
the purest sense, many use cigarettes either consciously or
unconsciously to stay awake or to wake up. How many late night
meetings, parties or rap sessions would survive without nicotine?
How many people could go on spending money in America's bars
without falling asleep were it not for the shock treatment received
each time a cigarette is smoked? Although not a depressant in the
purest sense, bear in mind the numerous people who ward off
hunger and weight gain by lighting up. During times of stress and
nervousness, the air is clouded with a continuous stream of smoke
that dulls the senses out of awareness. Awareness of a stressful
situation is essential in learning how to deal with it and feeling
that stress often motivates people to avoid making a mistake a
second time.

Some very primary senses are dulled also, like that of smell.
Deadened olfactory nerves will not serve a person when needed
to experience the full pleasure of an apple blossom. The olfactory nerve’s
partner in delight, the taste bud, combine to give pleasure in
culinary indulgence. This pleasure is far from what it could be for
the smoker. I'm not sure how much credence you would lend to
my belief that even the clarity of hearing and sight are impaired
but all would agree that there is little to compare with a heavy dose
of fresh mountain air and clean lungs enhance this delight a
hundredfold.

I figure by now anyone who is at all concerned with their
health and the health of their loved ones is still reading. I’m not
communicating with you to proselytize or be self-righteous. I
know full well that people stop hurting themselves only when they
are ready to and all of the information or scare tactics in the world
isn't going to change that. In some ways I can understand where
smokers are at, I smoked for 10 years and I will not climb my
soapbox about inconsiderate smokers.

The purpose of this essay is to point out how we as women
are being robbed of a more total life by indulging as individuals in
a counter-productive vice. Imagine if you will as I do a world where
people gained the self-love and control to stop putting these
tubular objects in our mouths, applying flame and then inhaling
dignity out of our lives.

Women’s Life and Work in the Southern Colonies. A decade later, her
research at last completed, the book was published by the
University of North Carolina Press. W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 1972
reading this 400-page volume will absorb colonial daily life from the
founding of the colonies to plantation, small farm and city. The large questions of
why women came and where they lived are answered, as well as the small ones like
what was in a colonial bedroom, and what were household necessities and
luxuries. Generalities are supported by inventories of large estates, letters and
memoirs.

Julia Cherry Spruill began her lengthy research on
female colonial life in 1927 with a grant from the Institute
for Research in Social Science. 

One of the classics of American social history,
Women’s Life and Work in the Southern Colonies, first pub-
lished in 1938, was finally reissued in 1972, when the
time of history caught up with the past come alive: colonial
women's leisures and pastimes, their wardrobes and
accessories - where, how and from what they were made.
She tells of the rituals of courtship and marriage, of
southern women’s education and the contents of a typical
lady’s library.

Women’s Life deals, in addition, with the lesser-
known aspects of the female situation in the colonial era. In
detail she tells of the women who participated in public life.
There was Mistress Margaret Brent, a plantation owner in
Maryland so powerful as to demand a seat in the
Assembly at a time when women weren't even allowed
to speak in church! There were female ferry-keepers,
jailers, printers, and many other “non-feminine” occupations in which the feminine
were actively engaged. Women of all classes were
shopkeepers, artisans, tavern hostesses and planters. Spruill details many of these
women; some are quite fascinating, such as Eliza
Lucas. At age 17, she took over the management of her
father's plantation. In addition to tending to the business,
she spent much time engaged in agricultural experiments. It
was she who introduced the cultivation and processing of
indigo to South Carolina; it became a major export of the
colonies.

Crimes colonial women committed, and the punish-
ments which followed, are another aspect of our social
history one can read about in few other places besides
Women’s Life. Julia Cherry Spruill also deals with the
manner in which the laws and courts regarded women in that
era (not very favorably) by quoting from numerous court
records and newspapers.

FDA Nears Decision
on Dalkon Shield Ban

Nancy Heine

No one has ever known
exactly how the intrauterine
(IUD) works to prevent preg-
nancy. But the serious side-
effects of one of these devices--the Dalkon Shield--
are now a matter of public
record: it has been responsi-
ble for 209 septic spontane-
ous abortions and 11 reported
deaths.

On June 27 of this year, the
United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) called a
halt to the sale and distribu-
tion of the Dalkon Shield until
it could investigate the matter
further. Studies were con-
ducted and hearings held in
August for that purpose. The
facts are now in, according to
Mary Carol Kelly of the FDA
Press Office, and a statement
on FDA findings and conclu-
sions will come late in
September.

The story goes that over
2000 years ago, camel drivers
inserted stones in the uteri of
their female camels to prevent
conception and birth over long
journeys. Not until 1970,
though, did the IUD come into
wide use among women.
Alarmed by Senate hearings
on the dangers of oral
contraceptives but still desir-
ing birth control, large num-
bers of women in the United
States gave the device a try.

During this time the Dalkon
Shield gained popularity a-
mong women who had never
been pregnant. Touted as the
“IUD that’s changing current
thinking about contracep-
tion,” the Shield claimed to
have a lower rejection rate
than did other IUDs for these
women.

The first Dalkon Shield ad,
which appeared in medical
journals, based its claims on a
single study done by Hugh
Davis, Shield co-inventor and
medical consultant to A.H.
Robins Co., manufacturer of
the device. The ad claimed a
pregnancy rate of 1.1%, an
expulsion rate of 2.3% and a
one year continuation rate--
that is, the number of women
who continue to wear the
Shield for one year--of 94%.

But the study was not
conducted on women who had
the device in place for one
year. It was conducted on 640
women for 3,549 “woman-
months of use.”

Dividing woman-months by
the number of women involved, the average insertion
time was only 5.5 months.

In a later ad, the A.H. Robins
Co. recommended that a
patient use another form of
contraception along with the
Shield for the first three
months of use. An irate
physician, testifying before
the House Hearings on
Medical Devices, noted that
this ad made claims based on
a guarantee covering little
more than two months of time
during which the Shield is the
only form of contraception
recommended.

While these ads were being
published, A.H. Robins had in
its files at least 10 independ-
ently conducted studies
showing the pregnancy rate as
high as 4.3% and continua-
tion rates as low as 41%.

David Links, Director of the
FDA Office of Medical Devic-
es, wrote at this time that
besides “mild puffery” the ads
for the device seemed “rea-
sonable and accurate.”

Meanwhile, reports of heavy
bleeding, painful insertion,
uterine perforation, higher
than expected pregnancy rates
and pregnancy complications
began coming in from women
using the Dalkon Shield as
well as other IUDs. A
physician’s survey by the US
Center for Disease Control
revealed that IUD use led to
more than 3,500 hospitaliza-
tions during the first six
months of 1973.

Then, in May 1974, A.H.
Robins sent out letters to
120,000 physicians advising
them that six deaths and 36
septic abortions appeared to
have been caused by the
Shield. By June, reports of
more deaths and abortions
forced the FDA into action.
Sale and distribution of the
Dalkon Shield were halted.

In July, the Department of
Health, Education and Wel-
fare (HEW) told its 3,000
federally funded family plan-
ning clinics to stop inserting
the Dalkon IUD. But it had
already been phasing them
out for the past two years
because information from
their abortion clinics indicat-
ed that the Shield had a higher
pregnancy rate than had been
advertised.

On August 21st, the FDA
opened a two-day public
hearing to gather facts and
professional opinions about the Shield. Physicians testi-
fied that 1 out of every 25 IUD
pregnancies occur outside of
the uterus and must be
aborted. They added that 209
women had suffered septic (or
infected) spontaneous abor-
tions during Dalkon Shield
pregnancies and that eleven
had died of the resulting
blood poisoning.

Over the Labor Day holiday,
members of the FDA Special
Advisory Sub-Committee met
to assess information gath-
ered at the hearing. But the
final verdict will not be out
until the end of September.

Because the FDA regards
the IUD as a “device” rather
than a drug, it hasn't the
authority to require pre-mar-
ket testing of the contracep-
tive. Neither can it require the
reporting of adverse reactions
associated with the device,
the registration of IUD manu-
facturers nor the attachment
of warning labels to each IUD
package.

Once marketed, however,
the agency can assume a
regulatory function if it is
capable of proving in court
that the product is dangerous
to health when used as
directed or is improperly
labeled. But the FDA only
takes action when it’s sure it
can win in court.

In the past twenty years the
FDA has taken action against
only one IUD. After two slow
years of investigation, the
action was taken just five days
before the House Hearings on
Medical Devices threatened to
expose the Majzlin Spring as a
dangerous device.

In California, the Coalition
of Medical Rights for Women
is not waiting for the FDA
decision. They've filed a
petition with the California
Department of Health calling
for a ban on all further sales
and distribution of IUDs until
they can be further tested for
safety and the adoption of a
regulation that would require
manufacturers to take all
steps necessary to inform
women of the potential
dangers.

Patty Fulcher, chairperson
of the Coalition said, “Women
are tired of being used as
guinea pigs for untested
medical devices sold at
enormous profits by large
drug companies.”

Women’s Life and Work in
the Southern Colonies is a
fascinating and thorough ac-
count of women of the
colonial period. It is factual,
objective history, but by no
means dull or dry. Quotations
from the original sources are
liberally scattered throughout
the book. Women’s Life has a
huge bibliography of primary
sources and a complete index.
Its publication in paperback
makes it a welcome volume to
anyone seriously interested in
the history of the American
woman."

tion “dedicated to advancing  
the opportunities for women  
and minorities in employ-  
ment, education and econo-  
mic development through  
both traditional and non-tra-  
ditional means.”  

TAPROOT was organized by  
seven Boulder feminists in the  
spring who chose the name  
TAPROOT because they see  
the root of “the woman’s  
problem” being women's eco-  
nomic powerlessness and  
women's traditional condi-  
tioning to accept this defini-  
tion of herself.  

The taproot of a tree is the  
source of its development so  
the nourishment of the tap-  
root provides is vital to the  
health of the tree.  

Membership in TAPROOT is  
open to anyone who shares a  
basic commitment to social  
equality. Members are eligible  
for participation in a food  
buying co-op and for group  
health and life insurance.  
Members can also register for  
classes at a reduced rate -  
classes designed to fill in  
some gaps in the traditional  
education offered to men and  
women. TAPROOT also offers  
assistance to businesses and

Boulder Women  

Boulder Resource Center Opens  

The Boulder County Wo-  

men’s Resource Center  

opened in September after its  
establishment was highly  
recommended by the city's  
Task Force on Women and  
Children. The Center is  
currently seeking funding so  
that it will be able to  
adequately deal with the  
problems women face in  
education, employment, legal  
issues, health and child care.  
The space the Center occu-  
pies in downtown Boulder is  
donated and shared by Wo-  
manpower, a job resource and  
referral agency. The office is  
staffed by volunteers, gradu-  

ate students and a half-time  
release employee from the  
Mental Health Center.  

A previous Women’s Center  
in Boulder, housed in High-  
land school, was anti-struc-  
ture and therefore hard to  
maintain, according to staff at  
the newly organized center.  
Any woman can receive  
walk-in counseling (of the  
non-professional type), infor-  
mation, referrals. There are  
brown bag lunches every  
Thursday for working women  
and other women who want to  
come and talk or just get to  
know the center.  

Women who work with the  
resource center are very  

representative of all women in  
Boulder, says Barbara Caley,  
a staff person. “There are  
women from diverse econo-  
mic, social backgrounds. Sin-  
gle heads of households,  
older and younger women,  
working women and profes-  
sional women.” The resource  
center will also work with  
other women's groups in  
Boulder so that services won't  
be duplicated and so that  
issues such as child care  
facilities in the city can be  
focused on by all women.  
Finally, it seems, Boulder  
women’s groups are coming  
together.  

Women’s Liberation Coalition  
Begins Another Term  

The Women's Liberation  
Coalition at the University of  
Colorado has come to life  
again after summer vacation.  
Although some women are  
facing trial for their part in the  
demonstration and occupa-  
tion of a university building  
last spring over the issue of  
day care, the first meeting  
drew about seventy women  
who listened to the history of  
the coalition and got involved  
in making its history for this  
school year.  

The coalition has speakers  
who go into the Boulder  
community to talk about  
women’s liberation. It has a  
media and community con-  
tacts committee and intends  
to coordinate its activities  
with other women’s groups. A  
newsletter will be written to  
hopefully reach dormitories  
with new students who don’t  
understand or have miscon-  
ceptions of women’s libera-  
tion.  

As a result of the day care  
action last spring, the coali-  
tion maintains, the university  
has begun construction on a  
day care center for 60 children  
- hardly enough for the  
demonstrated need for child  
care. It won't be finished until  
March or April (it was  

supposed to open this month)  
and student housing fees are  
building it. Fees for married  
student housing and for  
Kiddie Kampus, the small day  
care center the University now  
has, have been raised to pay  
back the loan. There is also a  
conflict between the concept  
of a center for child care and  
private home child care. The  
University favors individually  
licensed child care homes.  
Future action around the  
issue is planned at the next  
Regent meeting sometime in  
October.  

Another area that affects  
women at the school is the  
struggle that workers in the  
student grill have had and  
continue to have with man-  
agement. According to one  
woman who was recently fired  
from the grill with no warning  
(contrary to State Personnel  
procedure that requires 3  
warnings, 2 of which must be  
written) the management is  
unorganized, has no com-  
munication with workers, is  
all male, although half of all  
workers are female. Last year  
university employees that  
didn’t belong to unions tried  
to organize but were satisfied  
with a small wage increase  
and more input into policy  
decisions.  

Another activity of the  
coalition is the Women's  
Crisis Project that would get a  
Women's Center established  
near the campus so that not  
only students but also com-  
munity women could use the  
facility. Self-defense, self-  
help, legal resources, career  
counseling and intramurals  
are some of the activities that  
the center would sponsor. A  
hotline for rape referrals and  
information would also be  
established. Money is cur-  
rently being requested from  
the student government. “We  
need to show that we are here.  
We're paying out money and  
now we want some back,”  
says one member.  

In the past the structure and  
organization of the coalition  
has been very loose. This year  
women in the coalition want  
to see a definite strong  
organization so that women  
will have someone there when  
they need help or communi-  
cation with other women who  
share their oppressed posi-  
tion.  

A three member steering  
committee helps coordinate  
the activities of the coalition.  
The office is in the student  
union across from the grill in  
room 181.

Women’s  
Studies  

The Women's Studies Pro-  
gram at the University of  
Colorado is beginning acade-  
mic consciousness raising in  
the school’s departments and  
courses. The program coordi-  
nates and helps sponsor  
courses in the College of Arts  
and Sciences that deal with  
the neglected subject of  
women either as makers of  
history or as potential crea-  
tors of their own lives. Women  
in Literature, the sex roles of  
women in sociology, women's  
history, Experiential Studies  
courses in women’s oppres-  
sion and liberation and  
women in cross-cultural per-  
spectives from the Anthropology  
Department are some of  
the courses a woman can take  
at the university this fall.  

“At this point, we don't  
offer our own courses,” says  
Carol Pearson, director of the  
Women’s Studies Program.  
“We didn't ask for recognition  
as a department of our own for  
many reasons. Historically,  
departments that were for  
women even though they were  
heavy in academics turned  
into home ec. centers and the  
university wouldn't support  
them. There is no reason to  
think that would happen here  
but such a department may  
tend to congregate all women  
faculty in one department and  
create a ghettoization of  
women.  

“It would also take good  
women out of regular depart-  
ments and make it less likely  
that the general student body  
would take the courses, but  
rather only those students  
who were already interested in  
women’s studies.”  

Pearson also sees the  
necessity for “turning on  
students” and concerning  
other faculty members to  
change a course or teach it  
from another perspective that  
would include the historical  
neglect that academia has  
given women. This is another  
reason why it’s important not  
to isolate women’s studies in  
its own department.  

The Women’s Studies Pro-  
gram can be issues oriented  
or research oriented, its  
direction hasn’t yet crystal-  
lized. Office hours are from 9  
to 5 at Hillside Court #7, 17th  
and University in Boulder."

Political Womanpower

Some Colorado Candidates

Answers from the candidates listed here have been compiled from a questionnaire distributed by NOW Political Task Force. Time did not permit interviews of those candidates who did not turn in the questionnaire.

Roseanne Ball, R-Senate District 5 - Ball believes that the State “does have a comprehensive program for those who need help. The WIN program appears to be good;” believes that child care should be available for all parents but “not at state expense for all, we should look closely and be willing to discuss certain conditions such as the low salaried worker...”; supports the abortion decision; cannot answer the question on the women’s prison since “it is not under study and would surely need more solid facts before making a decision; the pregnancy compensation question needs “study”; supports all the rape reform legislation except the one that would redefine the term “spouse” so that its definition does not deprive the victim of protection under Colorado State Law.

Anne Thompson, R-Senate District 34 - “I firmly believe that abortion should be a matter of individual decision. I favor child care facilities, support state funding of family planning, and I am concerned about rape prosecution reform. Generally speaking, based on my previous experience in the General Assembly, I would say that each piece of proposed legislation must be viewed and studied as it is presented.”

Cathy Reynolds, D-House District 15 - Reynolds feels that the state can support totally small pilot programs of child care “but for any comprehensive urban the federal government will have to share at least equally in the expense; she feels that working parents should receive the benefits first “then others as space permits”; supports the abortion decision; supports state funding of family planning; supports closing the Women’s prison and transferring its functions to the Denver area; feels that pregnancy should be included under the scope of unemployment compensation “only if pregnancy was the reason the employer terminated the work. Then it becomes discrimination”; supports all the rape prosecution reform proposals.

Laura Miller, R-House District 28 - “I support the establishment and encouragement of development of additional child care centers, with the state assisting those unable to pay full support, or any support. I support the decisions of the Supreme Court (regarding abortion, specifically -ed.) as the Law of the Land.” Miller supports the idea of state funding of family planning; has not studied the problem of the women’s prison closure; does not support including pregnancy and pregnancy related problems under the scope of unemployment compensation; supports the rape reform prosecution proposals except for the redefinition of the term “spouse” which the candidate has “not studied.”

Nora Danielson, SWP [Socialist Workers Party], Governor - supports state funding for comprehensive child care “not only for state employees but for everyone. Parents should decide the policies, choose the teachers and the personnel. Child care should be a service provided by society not by only the parents.” The SWP candidate believes that abortion is a woman’s right and that the government shouldn't tell any woman whether or not to have a child. Danielson supports state funding of family planning but feels that the reasons the country (and the world) has so many problems is not because of overpopulation but because the USA doesn’t cooperate in a world socialist system with planned economy that would provide for all the needs of people, would assure good clean cities and wouldn't suffer from an “excess” of people. “It is a fallacy that problems can be solved by the number of people living in the world.

The real criminals aren't in prisons, says Danielson. It is complete hypocrisy that Nixon murdered in Vietnam, opposed abortion, amassed a complete assault on the civil liberties of everybody and that people who passed bad checks should be put in prison. The reason they did it in the first place is just to get by. Society thrives on poor people and they will fight to get back. In a socialist society there would be no prisons, people wouldn't need to steal a loaf of bread to survive. Rape is encouraged in our society by the way women are looked on as sex objects. And rape laws have traditionally been used by society to get to black and Chicano men. The problem won't be solved by easier convictions because that would just put more black and Chicano men into prison.

“Women should start fighting back in this society because women’s liberation threatens capitalist society and this society will do anything and everything it can to keep the movement a joke. Society should be run in the interests of the majority of the people not a few, the ones who control the wealth and own things for a living.

“Ideas of women’s liberation are just now becoming acceptable to women workers - women who are forming the CLUW here in Denver. Women are organizing and fighting for what they want.”

Joan J. Harrison, D-House District 50 - would support partial state funding for comprehensive child care facilities “hoping federal funds would be added in the near future. H.B. 1258, 1973 session, called for about $800,000. I presume this is low, but funding of the new functions needs to take into account some start-up time and probably better data on needs; all parents should be eligible for child care, Harrison believes; the candidate supports the abortion decision of the Supreme Court; supports state funding of family planning; feels uninformed on the issue of closing the Women's Prison, “my gut reaction would be to close Canon City in the interests of decentralization, allowance for families; does not support including pregnancy and related problems under the scope of unemployment compensation; favors the rape reform proposals.

Betty Ann Dittemore, R-House District 37 - supports state funding for comprehensive child care facilities “for those mothers in ADC;” supports the abortion decision of the Supreme Court of January, 1973; supports state funding of family planning “to a limited extent;” believes that the Women's Penitentiary in Canon City is underutilized and is in favor of closing it “if facilities are available;” Dittemore would “have to see statistics on resultant costs” before she could decide on including pregnancy and related problems under unemployment compensation; supports rape reform proposals, but would have to see the proposed redefinition of the term spouse.

Marcelline T. Verhoff - wrote no opinion to the first question; feels that just working parents should receive such child care; says that abortion “is a personal thing” for a woman to decide herself; supports state funding of family planning; agrees to closing down the women’s prison if it could be handled better, but “where will they be kept?”; would have to think more about the “interesting problem” of including pregnancy problems under unemployment compensation; believes that the state should pay costs of emergency care, related follow-up psychological care for victims of violent crimes, but not the burial costs.

Jean Marks, D-House District 33 - Marks strongly supports state funding for comprehensive child care facilities that should be available to all parents; she supports the Supreme Court decision regarding abortion; gives a “qualified yes” to the support of state funding of family planning; feels the Women's Penitentiary in Canon City should be closed, “I believe there are more educational, counseling, etc. facilities available here and the chances are greater that they would be closer to their families here;” supports including pregnancy related problems and allowing a limited time for pregnancy under unemployment compensation; supports the rape reform proposals but feels “the defendant’s rights must also be protected.”

Pat Schroeder, D-US Congress - U.S. Representative Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) told a very warm and accepting audience at the August 29th general meeting that the real problem for women today is the economy, because “women are the first shut out, and women are going to have hard times ahead because the economy is going to have hard times ahead.” She said that we, as women, must become, “much more economically oriented,” which is going to become tougher as the economic scene unfolds.

Representative Schroeder cited current Department of Labor statistics showing a 35% higher rate of unemployment among women than men. Women earn 40% less than men yet, she said, women don’t receive a 40% discount on the goods and services they buy. What we must fight, she said, is the old myth that women work not because they need to, but to pass the time away.

The women we must work hardest for—and NOW tends also to forget them, she said—are the young women who bought the American dream of the housewife’s role with husband and family and are now divorced or separated heads of households without job skills or the economic access to the good life. Representative Schroeder reminded her audience that our country has created this woman. We have convinced young girls that they don’t need economic skills, because, “if you're married, you don’t need a skill.” Our male-oriented society has taught our young women that “your main job is to troll and catch me.”

“We've got to figure out some way not to put people down,” she said, “but to allow them to participate. Why put down women who are 53% of our brainpower?”

Responding to questions on inflation, Representative Schroeder proposed a reduction of high interest rates which she feels would “bring the market back”: controls on food (“even though I have been a free trader”); better anti-trust laws; and an increase in the personal tax exemption (it’s only $150 more today than during World War II); and a drastic reduction in the defense budget (70% of the

controllable budget is de-
fense, of which only 5% is for
strategic weapons).

Other political concerns
which do not receive adequate
attention in the “men’s club”
of the United States Congress
include children and the aged.
“Children are our most impor-
tant natural resource,” Repre-
sentative Schroeder stated,
but they appear in the budget

only when legislation is
enacted to control juvenile
delinquency.

Concerning the possibility
of governmental subsidizing
of day care centers, Repre-
sentative Schroeder suggests
giving tax incentives to
corporations to set up day
care centers for their employ-
ees’ children. She said, “we
might be able to get this
through because it won’t take
any funds.”

According to a study
conducted by Ralph Nader,
white women over 65 are the
poorest segment of the
population. In a question and
answer period which extended
after the general meeting
adjourned, Ms. Schroeder
stated that the Ford Founda-
tion has allocated funds for
grocery stores on wheels
which will allow the aged to
purchase groceries at home.

We're on the verge of trying
to get different kinds of
people in Congress, she said.
As an example, Wilbur Mills
has a 30-year-old woman
running against him. But we
have a long way to go getting
women into responsible gov-
ernment positions. Out of six
Nixon nominees to the Su-
preme Court there were no
women; there is no woman in
the Cabinet; no woman in the
Senate and only sixteen
women in The House of
Representatives. Representa-
tive Schroeder said she often
tells her colleagues that “a
stag Senate is a stag nation.”

Press releases from the
Nixon Administration praise
the number of women hired
for government service. Re-
presentative Schroeder added,
“this is a phenomenal record—
more than we’ve ever had
before,” but she explained
sarcastically the increase
means that of 12,000 govern-
mental positions, 118 are
filled by women (less than
1%). Of those having a GS 13
rating, only 4% are women;
yet, the GS 1 through GS 6
ratings are 70% women. ""This
is no great sterling example.”

Pat Schroeder stated that
the nation is watching Denver,
because Denver has demon-
strated the effectiveness of
the grassroots movement, in
challenging the Olympics, re-
moving nerve gas, and, in
electing a woman whose
campaign was based on the
value of the individual. “We
can’t let people get crushed,”
Ms. Schroeder affirmed.

Representative Schroeder
emphatically pointed out that,
“there is no bill that doesn't
affect women. Legislation
affecting the tax code, Social
Security and military benefits
all apply to women. “We are
53% of the population. I am
tired of women apologizing
for being women,” she said.

Pat Schroeder was at home

Peggy Sanbourne, R-House
District 35 - sees a “need” for
child care but does not think
that it should be completely
free but cost should be on a
graduated scale; thinks that
closing down the Women’s
Prison needs more study and
that there would have to be “a
suitable alternative” maybe a
half-way house in Denver;
feels that there is a “vast field
of education that needs to be
done on rape” and that the
proposals need to be looked
into; “I’ve always been known
to be a very fair individual,”
says Sanbourne. “I believe
there are important values for
America and Colorado that are
best expressed in a Republi-
can political philosophy: that
without emphasis on financial
responsibility, personal own-
ership of the means of
production, traditional values
in education, and homage to
God within the family circle
there can ultimately be no
family, no knowledge, no
production and no nation.”

Arie Taylor, D-House District
7 - Definitely supports state
funding for comprehensive
child care facilities; believes
that cost should be based on
ability to pay for all parents;
supports the right for every
woman to decide whether to
have a child or not; thinks
that the Women’s Penitentiary

- should be closed and women

returned to metro Denver
where they can be near their
families; supports including
pregnancy and pregnancy-re-
lated problems under the
scope of unemployment com-
pensation; supports “most”
of the rape reform proposals,
“but some need strengthening.” Taylor is a people-oriented
representative and is a
strong supporter of a con-
sumer rights bill that will keep
the “consumer from getting
ripped off.”

Sarah Masterson, R-House
District 28 - Masterson does
not want the state to fund
child care but thinks that
businesses should be encour-
aged to do it on their own;
parents should pay for the
cost of child care because
“when responsibility is taken
away from people to pay it’s
bad. The state should work
through free enterprise. The
candidate does not want to
get embroiled in the abortion
controversy, but concedes
that “there are many cases
where abortion is the only
answer. I’m not going to sit in
judgment - I'm not eager to
fight the Supreme Court.
Masterson supports state
funding of family planning;
and believes that the penalty
for rape should be the “same
penalty as for premeditated
murder,” and that the rape
reform proposals will proba-
bly help to clean up the
ambiguous prosecution sur-
rounding rape.

Barbara Holme, D-State Sen-
ate District 5 - supports fully
state funding for comprehen-
sive child care facilities with a

sliding scale, with fees
increasing as the family
income rises. “To improve

child care in my district I
would like to encourage
businesses, churches, tem-
ples, and schools to operate
or at least provide space for
child care facilities. I whole-
heartedly support the Equal
Rights Amendment and the
Supreme Court's decision in
Roe v. Wade (which allowed
women the freedom to decide
whether or not to bear
children). Feminist task for-
ces should make every at-
tempt to achieve quick ratifi-
cation of ERA. Any attempt to
amend the Constitution to
limit a woman's right to
decide whether to bear child-
ren should be opposed.
Should such an amendment
be passed by Congress, it is
important to have strong
legislators in every state
refuse it ratification. I would,
of course, oppose ratification
of such an amendment.
Holme supports state funding
of family planning since
“voluntary family planning
prevents unwanted pregnan-
cies, prevents the need for
abortion and is the most
effective government program
per dollar spent; favors
improving our jails and
prisons and hesitates “to add
any more facilities to the
Denver metro area while
growth here remains so
uncontrolled; believes the
“unemployment compensa-
tion is primarily for those who
become involuntarily unem-
ployed. With birth control,
most pregnancy is voluntary
and the associated costs,
except for the poor, should be
borne by the families;”
supports all the rape prosecu-
tion reform proposals.

Pat Burrows, D-House District
52 - “I support state funding of
child care facilities. I support
state support of a study
looking into the feasibility of
on-site facilities, jointly sup-
ported by industry and go-
vernment. I believe alternative

Coven Gets Revenge; Ames, Iowa-- When Iowa State University
lent its facilities to the Miss Iowa Beauty Pageant two years ago,
the Women’s Coalition sought the help of a local witch coven -
DARC, the Des Moines Ames Radical Coven. It hexed the
pageant and its supporters, and the television station, KDIN. Within
an hour KDIN suffered a power failure. Part of the hex involved
laying a curse on ground earmarked for a football stadium. A
substantial portion of the construction was complete when lo! it
began to tilt and sink slowly into the ground. Barbara X of DARC
expressed surprise that it had taken so long. She said the coven is
willing to remove the hex in return for a 7.4 million dollar child
care center to be built in its place. (Off Our Backs, Aug-Sep. 74)

Widening Gap Reported in Earnings-- According to the latest
consumer income survey of the US Bureau of the Census, the
income of a typical full-time woman worker employed year-round
in '73 was $6,490- or 57% of her male counterpart in the work
force. The gap between the sexes has thus widened and was three
percentage points bigger in '73 than it was in '71. (The
Spokeswoman, Aug. 15, 74)

Indictment of Ms. Magazine-- “On behalf of six million Lesbian
women and hundreds of thousands of women-identified
Feminists in the USA...the Lesbian Tide magazine charges Ms.
magazine with: Gross neglect and psychic genocide against
Lesbian women, sexist and heterosexist representation of
women, and perpetuating anti-feminist attitudes and politics...”
The Tide went on to point out that in two years of publishing, Ms.
“has published 5 out of 505 major articles (.99%) by Lesbians
about Lesbians’ lives and needs; has printed 9 out of 537 letters
(1.7%) by, about, or relating to Lesbian women; has employed
one active, public Lesbian on its editorial staff; has printed
innumerable ads which consistently portray women in exclusive
relationship to men, in fashion model imagery and in
professional, classist roles."" Also noting that Ms. is owned by a
male corporation, the Tide went on to resolve “that until Ms.
re-evaluates and begins to adequately represent the politics and
lifestyles of Lesbian radical Feminists, we the Lesbian Nation
cancel our subscription and support of a magazine whose pages
have cancelled our reality.” (The Lesbian Tide, Aug, 74)

How to Avoid Rape!-- “Don't go out without clothes, that
encourages men. Don’t go out with clothes, any clothes
encourage some men...Avoid childhood, some rapists are turned
on by the very young. Avoid old age, some rapists inflict
themselves on older women...Don't have a father, grandfather,
uncle, or brother, these are the relatives who most often rape
young women. Don't marry, rape is legal within marriage. To be
quite sure, don't exist!” (Saskatoon WL Newsletter, July, 74)

Shameless Gossip-- It has recently been reported that an avid fan
of BMR distributed papers in all the gas station women’s
restrooms from Denver to points East. (Talk about grass-roots
organizing!) Someone else said that the restrooms were a
good place for the papers."

The general membership of  
the Women's Center Coalition  
has been presented with a  
statement of purpose and a  
proposed governing structure  
by its temporary coordinating  
committee. According to the  
statement of purpose the  
Women’s Center Coalition has  
as its purpose “to nurture and  
centralize the women's com-  
munity, especially that of the  
Denver area; to seek out and  
serve the cultural, education-  
al, social, business, health  
and communication needs of  
women; to create and sustain  
a facility known as the Denver  
Women’s Center where these  
functions will be centralized.”

The proposed governing  
body of the Women’s Center  
is the center council which  
would be composed of a  
representative from each  
member organization and wo-  
men who do not associate  
themselves with any specific  
group or organization. The  
center council is seen as  
being the most potentially  
responsive process to receive  
input from all Coalition  
members and to generate  
active involvement; to foster  
the diversified interests, acti-  
vities, and philosophies of  
Coalition members; to avoid  
the use and/or abuse of power  
by any individual or group  
within the Coalition; and to  
prevent the polarization (cul-  
turally, socially or politically)  
of organizations and individu-  
als within the Denver Wo-  
men’s Center Coalition.”

The Women's Festival  
raised $400.00 after expenses  
for the Women’s Center. For a  
period of “six months this  
money will be held in a high  
interest savings account so  
that the Coalition has the time  
to get by-laws firmly written,  
to have itself well organized  
and soundly structured, and  
to raise additional money for  
the Women’s Center.

Any woman who wants to  
can become a participant in  
the policy making decisions  
of the Women's Center Coal-  
ition. In order for the Women’s  
Center to become a reality,  
the work of the Coalition must  
be the shared experience of all  
women.”

POST

Big Mama Rag had originally announced a poetry contest. A statement prepared by Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, and Alice Walker, all nominated for the National Book Award for Poetry, has encouraged us to join in a new feminist tradition not following the usual competitive standards of a contest. Part of their statement reads: “We can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry—if it is poetry—exists in a realm beyond comparison.”

In this spirit, we have decided to acknowledge all of the entries and to share the prize money among the women in this community rather than selecting one winner for the announced prize money of $10.00, and so the amount will be offered to the development of a Women’s Center.

Sovereign of the Streets

Tonight

Picnics

Leaf eyes and leaf mouth

Pressed - no crushed -

so that green leaf juice

Smeared upon our fingers and stains our bodies.  
It won't wash out, mother always said,

And she was right.

It never did. Not a bit of it.

Soak it all you want. Scrub it.

Mother was right.

It's really rather embarrassing to be seen like this.  
Change my clothes.

All clean.

Oops. What about the fingers.

(Everybody will know where you’ve been)

That won't come out either.

Maybe it will wear away in time....

“Steps”  
a - Michele Barale  
My heart beats slow and  
painfully. I wish to hurt  
no one. I want to laugh  
and give myself. I want  
to dance and touch  
someone.

I have decided to wear purple

And gold on my neck and arms and fingers and toes  
I'll be violet-eyed

And I'll be the Queen.

Sovereign of the Streets

I'll be the Harlot,

Dietrich and Cleo and Catherine the Great

I'll sparkle my way downtown

And then glitter home again

Yesterday

I was the lioness

I was all gold and brown and shattering

Purring and snarling and feline

And so Wicked

I was Medusa,

Destruction in a glance

The Trojan Horse, and riant at the ruin in my wake,  
I prowled gilded jungles downtown

And then I green-eyed my way home again

Tomorrow

I'll be a witch

In black, I'm a ghost

A dark-eyed Harpy, clawed and winged

Mysterious and so Evil

I'll be the Phantom, an Illusion

Look! I'm the Bogeywoman!

I'll go downtown, ethereal it all the way,

And then I'll make my Supernatural way home again

I want to sleep so soundly  
soft and wake in the dawn  
with you beside me. And see  
you wake and smile right back.

I step so soft I tremble now,  

don’t know where to walk to. I must  
depend on no one else. I feel so  
lost

and hard

and cold.

I need someone that must be me  
to step

and walk

and live. For now.

Menstrual poems,

Blood red.

I cannot stop them.

They slide and splatter

Out of my body

And spot the cold tile of the floors.

I do not want to write them.

They are not what I thought poetry was made of.  
But I cannot - will not - staunch their flow.  
Irregular and cramped,

My handwriting runs across the paper

And I read its spoor.

They smell of myself, these poems,

And trace the delicate, intricate, arterial pattern

of my mother and daughter

And a man who once, staring at my blood-smudged thighs,  
asked in a child’s wonder and fear so like my own,  
Does it hurt, does it hurt? :

The Lady and the Cat

I sit all alone  
Beside my bucket and stove  
and sing as I rock along  
The words come out clear  
as my voice disappears  
and my cat just jumped  
on my lap.  
I sit all alone  
out on my dusty old porch  
and sing as I rock along  
The sky becomes black  
as the rain comes with a splash

and my cat just jumped on my lap.

I lay all alone  
in my dusty old grave  
as I heard a tap on my door  
I open my eyes  
and find a surprise  
and the cat just jumped  
on my lap  
- Cindy Robinson

Closets

I bring the pen out from under my wings  
where it blooms into a quill

Blowing out the light to hide me

I move toward the other side of the room  
My ears pick out a cat, its size

alters with the twitching of my lobes

The room is all doors

For a moment I pretend to hide behind one  
but I am afraid no one will find me—

then I am afraid I will never come out

You pull me into the air

we walk along a rill smelling of snakes

that will not come out of doors till we have gone  
and then, in the sensation of our bellies  
touching across a shady membrane

the need for all the doors resonates within me  
Stone metaphors lead me through a crusted lane  
Something just ahead of me knows the path  
steers me through crystal trees and an opening  
lined with rose hips and brittle bones

Only now do I understand the parabolas  
Only now do the quickly healing lesions  
show that the fear within me

was hunched over my own notions

In the open spaces between our legs

I stop following myself

I toss my head at the signature of others  
I reach for myself

a bright fruit grown late.

Women &
_ Histor

Emma Goldman

Emma Goldman was a famed anarchist and feminist whose
revolutionary ideas and outspokeness made her a legend in her
own time. She was born in czarist Russia on June 27, 1869. When
she was seventeen she left Russia and joined her sister in
Rochester, New York, fleeing a tyrannical father and an arranged
marriage. She went to work in a garment factory, as she had in
Russia, and soon married another immigrant. But after being
radicalized by the hanging of the Haymarket martyrs, she divorced
her husband and left for New York City where she almost
immediately began her career as a lecturer and organizer, at first
working closely with Alexander Berkman and Johann Most, the
well-known anarchists. But very quickly Emma was known, in her
own right, as a passionate speaker and dynamic organizer. She
spoke to the issues of draft resistance, feminism, the need for
birth control, “free love,” and anarchism. She was often arrested
as a matter of course when she was to speak somewhere — and
she claimed she always carried a book with her so if she was
arrested she would have something to read in jail.

The Homestead massacre led her to co-conspire with
Berkman in plotting the assassination of industrialist Henry C.
Frick. Berkman spent fourteen years in prison for the shooting
though Frick was only wounded and recovered quickly. Emma was
never tried for that plot but later was imprisoned for complicity in
the plot to kill President McKinley, though she was innocent of
that charge.

Emma Goldman was a nurse and midwife and so witnessing
the tragedy of poor women having more babies than they wanted
or could care for, she spoke and wrote about the necessity of birth
control methods and safe abortions. She expressed her own regret
at not being able to perform abortions herself but she knew of no
safe method to use. Perhaps what Emma is most well known for is
her analogy between marriage and prostitution, and she
contemptuously criticized the hypocrisy of those who harassed
and imprisoned prostitutes. Though she was disappointed in the
women's emancipation movement at the time, she expressed her
views of the importance of liberation in her essay “The Tragedy of
Woman Emancipation.” She wrote: “Emancipation should make it
possible for woman to be human in the truest sense. Everything
within her that craves assertion and activity should reach its
fullest expression; all artificial barriers should be broken, and the
road towards greater freedom cleared of every trace of centuries of
submission and slavery.”

“Red Emma,” as she was known, did speak and write in
support of Women’s Liberation but her movement work was
primarily with male colleagues, and she believed very much in an
integrated revolutionary movement. Her autobiography, which is
intriguing reading, communicates her insight, spirit, and most
impressively her incredible self-confidence.

Emma was deported back to Russia in 1919, and her
deportation hearing was presided over by J. Edgar Hoover
himself. As the boat pulled out she thumbed her nose at a
congressman who had come to watch the exit of the deported
anarchists. Once in Russia, which had experienced a revolution,
she criticized the repression she saw there. She left Russia,
traveled around, and finally settled in France where she died. Her
body was shipped to the US and she was buried in the same
cemetery with the Haymarket martyrs.

Lesbian Writers
Come Out of

Their Closets

Chocolate Waters and Sandia

Lesbian writers have often
had to come out of a very
different type of closet. Many
of them, plagued with the
self-doubt that has followed
women throughout history,
have hid their poems, stories,
chapters of potential books
and essays in bureau drawers.
Others, knowing their chances
of being published were
poor because they were
women or because they feared
repercussions if their real
names were known, hid under
masculine pseudonyms. Mari
Kuda, an organizer of the
Lesbian Writers’ Conference
held in Chicago September
13-15, stated that one of the
main purposes of the confer-
ence was to encourage and
support these very women.

The conference began Fri-
day night with a talk by Valerie
Taylor, an author in her 60s
who has published seven
novels about women. Her
speech was punctuated with
humorous and informative
disclosures about Lesbians in
the world of letters. Ms.
Taylor, herself a Lesbian
grandmother, noted the proud
inheritance from our cultural
grandmothers and empha-
sized how we could learn from
their experiences.

She traced Lesbian writers
from the beginning of the
twentieth century, focusing
particularly on the 50s. It was
during the early part of this
period that the market was
flooded with badly written,
sensationalistic Lesbian nov-
els (most written by men)
which depicted “a beautiful
butch in black lace underwear
who never gets out of bed
long enough to send the
sheets to the laundry. In the
end she renounces women,
finding true love with a male
instead.”

Long Impressive List

At the same time, Lesbian
writers were trying to incor-
porate the theme of women
loving women in a more
dignified and realistic way.
The list is long and impressive
although not well known to
most readers: Gayle Wilhelm,
May Sarton, Violette Le Duc,
Jeanette Foster, Djuna
Barnes, and Colette - to
mention a very few. It is
impossible to explain their
contributions in depth here.
For this reason one of the
most important outgrowths of
the conference was the
bibliography Woman Loving
Woman, compiled by the
Chicago organizers. (Ed.
note: now available at the
BMR office).

The 60s, according to
Valerie Taylor, was a turning
point in the history of Lesbian
Literature because of the
Women’s Movement and the
Gay Liberation Movement.

Women were now beginning
to realize that Lesbianism was
not only a viable lifestyle, it
was also politically important
in the context of a male-dom-
inated world. Out of this
realization grew such books
as Lesbian Nation, Sappho
was a Right-On Woman, and
Lesbian Woman.

Her speech ended with a
challenge for writers of the
70s to continue with this
proud inheritance and to
develop not only Lesbian
themes, but to “write about
the whole world.”

Writing Explored

On Saturday, several work-
shops explored different as-
pects of writing including
criticism, poetry, articles,
fiction, and getting published.
One unique idea viewed
writing as a collective expres-
sion and the fiction workshop
experimented with this idea
and composed a collective
story. The need for a feminist
aesthetic or a way in which
women can express feminine
values in their writing was a
theme which ran throughout
many of the workshops.

The conference, which end-
ed with women reading their
original works and singing
their own songs, was for the
most part quite successful.
The agenda was well organ-
ized and carefully planned
although structure did at
times prevent a free flow of
discussion. There also
seemed to be some underly-
ing political differences con-
cerning the relationship of art
to Lesbian Feminism, and
these unexpressed feelings
subtly inhibited the confer-
ence in some respects. The
organizers tactfully prevented
any disruptions from occur-
ring, but for the sake of the
Chicago women, we do hope
these differences will even-
tually be worked out.

Nevertheless, the Lesbian
Writers’ Conference demon-
strated that women all over
the country are indeed writ-
ing, and writing in a way
which is positively reflective
of the Lesbian in life and
literature today. Write-On!

Lesbian writers talk about being published: “Often you just have to know
somebody,” said Cindy Carr, an article writer for the Chicago Sun-Times.

for others. Sometimes when
people would tell me that they
were broke, that meant they
were down to $50 in their
checking accounts, but they
still had fat savings accounts
and fat parents at home to
send them money, and I
didn’t. I tired of explaining
this to people and tired of
being embarrassed when they
acted like they were feeling
sorry for me but never once
offered to help me out in any
way.

People I knew in college
with money (which was
almost everyone else) seemed
to act as if money really didn’t
matter to them...they would
spend a lot of it all the time,
and that seemed so wasteful. I
grew to hate their casualness
and their easy assumptions
that everyone they knew must
be “like them” somehow, and
I think it came as a great
shock when they found out
differently. They got uncom-
fortable, didn’t know how to
treat me, and usually ended
up avoiding me.

This was about the time
that hippies began to get a lot
of publicity and illogically to
me, it was their style of dress
and their manners that be-
came popular as a result.
Hippies were supposed to
look like bums, yeah, but you
were either an “in” hippie or
not. The other kids would BUY
their clothes. Their clothes
didn’t get raggedy from wear,
and they also had a choice
whether to wear raggedy
clothes or not. I didn’t. It was
an “in” thing to look as poor
as possible, but only in a
stylish way. So this whole trip
still left me outside the rest of
the world as far as I was
concerned.

People would poormouth all
the time and try to rent cheap
apartments and cut down on
their spending, etc., but they
did that only because it was a
cool thing to do and not
because there was any real
need to do so. It made me so
mad because that cut down on
the places I could rent and
that I had to rent because of
the amount of money I had to
spend (or didn’t have); and
then too, when enough
middle-class people decided
to always rent cheap places,
that left only higher-priced
places for me, which I
couldn't afford at all but had
to struggle with anyway. It
was terribly unfair and there
was absolutely nothing I
could do about it except be
angry. Another thing that
made me furious about that,
was when these people did
rent cheap places, they would
spend hundreds of dollars
fixing them up with expensive
furnishings I never would have
dreamed of (nor could I
possibly afford), and I again
was not “in” because my
place was never as nice as
anybody else’s.

College made me angry
because I was encouraged at
every turn to make it my life’s
work perpetuating the mid-
die-class system, which I not
only was excluded from but
which had victimized and
shamed me from the start.

But the absolute worst
thing that happened to me in
college was that these mid-
die-class pressures and val-
ues became so strong that I
found myself selling out to
them. I conformed, in order to

be accepted. I spent money I
shouldn’t have and went
hungry so that I could have

some clothes that were
reasonably in style. I drank
beer and went out to eat. I
adopted some of the attitudes
of my so-called friends, in
order to become a part of their
group, although that kind of
total integration was never
really possible. I began to
think of myself as middle
class, and then, after a while,
I decided that by virtue of my
new knowledge of some of the
attitudes, manners, and
styles, that indeed now I had
become a middle-class wo-
man. That got me into some
circles where before I would
have been excluded. But I was
always trying to be like
everyone else and I was
completely miserable doing it,
because I just did not have the
same background they did
and never got the hang of
about % of the necessary
things that come naturally to
middle-class people. So in
many ways I was still an
outsider no matter what I did,
with the exception that now I
had people to talk to, and
since that had been a major
part of my goal in the first
place, I felt I had made some
real progress.

There were other people in
college from poor families,
too, but instead of making
friends with them and sharing
our common bonds, I had sold
out completely enough that I
now turned on them and used
them as objects of ridicule as
fervently as I had once been
oppressed. The middle class
was a place I wanted to be so
badly that once I felt a taste of
it, I was not about to give it up
for anything. It was a part of
looking out for myself, but at
the expense of trying to
completely negate and deny
all that had been a part of me
for twenty years of my life.

And then it was suddenly
over. I was out in the world at
last, my future seemingly
secure, with my past safely
buried behind four years of
hard work and a degree and
my newly-adopted middle
class consciousness. But I
soon discovered, to my
horror, that my past would not
lie still in its grave. The
feelings I grew up with did not
vanish into oblivion, and no
glorious life awaited me
simply because I held a magic
piece of paper in my hands.
No mere golden fleece was a
ticket to wealth and fame, and
I think I knew that deep down
inside all the time I was going
to school. I was torn between
despair and the still-urgent
desire to make a financially
secure life for myself.

I was caught between a rock
and a hard place. I had arrived,
I thought, at the gates of
middle-class heaven and had
not exactly been turned away
but there were not all that
many open arms, either. And I
was also being confronted
with my past, the same as
always. How was I going to
take this shy, sensitive,
still-imaginative woman, with
all her luggage of dreams,
needs, and unfulfilled desires,
to the promised land safely?
How could I ever get there
with all my fears, when I
couldn't even say things to
other people the way I really
meant? How could I reconcile
all those new things in myself
that didn’t really belong there,
attitudes I allowed into my
consciousness just because
other people told me they
were good? If I didn’t think
about it long and hard, I knew

it was going to destroy me. I
had met the enemy and
instead of fighting back, as I'd
always planned, I made
friends and took the enemy
within. I still felt more
strongly than ever that there
was something wrong with
me, that I was still somehow
not as good as other people. I
still carried a cloak of shame
around my shoulders, and this
time for some good reasons.

After agonizing over
thoughts like these for several
years, it occurred to me finally
that maybe, just maybe, there
was nothing wrong with me at
all. I'd accepted that judgment
for so long that it was like a
rut, and not so easy to get out
of. But just thinking about it
that way started to make me
feel good about myself for the
first time in many years, and
the more I thought about it,
the more free I felt, free to be
whoever I want and free of the
invalid, crippling judgments
of others, free of a false and
damning class identity and
more certain of my roots,
roots that were real, would not
go away no matter what I did,
and which were every bit as
valid as anyone else's.

I do not know if I will ever be
totally free from feelings of
inferiority of “not being good
enough”...I think that even if I
had a million dollars in my
pocket, in my heart I would
still feel like an 11-year-old
child sweating in the fields at
the bottom of everything; I
would still feel poor. Any
dignity I have claimed I have
fought for, just as I have
fought for material security,
and I have paid a terrible price.

The pain and suffering and
humiliation I have lived
through, many women will
never know, except third
world women and working
class women, many of whom
have just plain given up. I
think in many ways I was
lucky, because I had enough
incentive to keep going. A lot
of us didn’t make it, and in
working class words that
means death. I am sorry that
for a period in my life, I didn’t
help; if I bear any legitimate
shame today it is for that
alone.

My story is far from unique.
What I feel as a result of my
working class background I
share with millions, especially
third world women. The
reason I have told it is to get
to the gut issues, to try to say
(in what words I have) how it
feels to grow up being used by
society for what it can get out
of me and damn near bled dry.

The point of all this is that
no middle- or upper-class
woman can relate to my pain
until she can feel some of it
herself. I know in my guts if a
woman is from a working
class background, and I can
spot middle-class values
coming at me from a mile
away. I’ve learned to depend a
lot on my gut-level feelings;
they warn me who is liable to
fuck me over the worst and
who is sensitive to my pain
and anger.

My anger about being
fucked over for my class and
caste is ABSOLUTELY INTOL-
ERABLE when I feel it coming
from women who think of
themselves as feminists, and I
feel it more and more strongly
every day.

To be a little more specific,
these are some of the things
that middle-class women still
do to rip me off, put me down,

responsible for her father's
Cadillac. In other words, a
working-class woman's pain
was countered by a middle-
class woman's guilt.

Guilt is a seductive tool to
manipulate and mask another's
pain and oppression. By
changing the focus of atten-
tion from another's real,
experienced pain and social
oppression, to a personal
mind-state such as guilt, a
middle-class woman justifies
in her mind the status quo,
i.e. her supremacy. She thinks
her guilt is more painful than a
working-class woman's entire
life of objective pain, (i.e. not
eating well, the necessity of
working at menial jobs etc.)
An uneasy conscience does
NOT equal a life of poverty.
Middle-class women must
begin with this understand-
ing. They must stop and listen
to the life experiences of
working-class women and
note the significant difference

between a working-class
world and their own. We are
responsible to listen and
change those of our actions
that continue to oppress other
women from different life si-
tuations. Likewise, men are
responsible to change their
attitudes and actions that are
oppressive towards women.

Once middle and upper
class women are aware of a
working-class woman's real
pain, they are responsible to
change their attitudes and
actions. Guilt does not
change the real conditions of
poverty. Guilt produces ac-
tions like Christmas food
baskets that make the poor
objects of pity, rather than
people responsible and capa-
ble of changing the conditions
of their own lives. A classist
person, who out of guilt
doesn’t want to be classist, is
like a racist or sexist person
trying not to be racist or
sexist. A guilty classist
person, in a hurried and
careless manner, will rush
about trying to collect work-
ing-class friends. A racist
analogy is the movie, “Guess
Who's Coming To Dinner.”
Oppressive attitudes and
manners don’t change out of
guilt. Sidney Poitier is de-
humanized in the artificial
gaiety of Spencer Tracy's and
Katherine Hepburn’s happy
liberal home. A change in
consciousness is needed, not
tokenism.

Working-class women are
angry. Anger is a creative
emotion when its true roots
are understood. Through that
understanding, a creative vi-
sion of a newer world is
developed. Right now, in
Denver, we are in the basic
anger/guilt stages of con-
sciousness. Working-class
anger is met with middle-
class apologetic guilt. What is
needed is that higher con-
sciousness of a woman's
world. A woman, in a
woman's world, will have both
the virtues and strengths of
both working and middle-
class experiences.

A creative, open and honest
discussion of classism is
needed in our present wo-
man’s community. Here are
some of the points that have
been brought up, but need
much more thought and work.

issue. Come to the Big Mama

SOME IDEAS TO EXPLORE

1. Love is bought and sold
in different ways in different
classes.

2. The women's Movement
is class conscious for the last
three or four years unlike
society in general.

3. We are checking out our
roots and seeing if they have
validity.

4. When you get to
professional levels, you don’t
necessarily have to adopt the
value system of that level.

5. In thinking about
revolution, middle and upper
class women see only materi-
al loss, not the potential
freedom from being alienated
from their bodies, their ener-
gies, and their strength.

6. Men don't like women
and treat them like a piece of
shit; working-class people are
“women” in the eyes of upper
class men (i.e., subservient,
“under control,” inferior, “us-
able."")

7. I. Women are an inferior
caste in the patriarchal sys-
tem. The classes of the
patriarchy are stamped into
women's consciousnesses,
and that criteria for determin-
ing worth is carried over into
our dealings with women. We
bring to our experiences with
other women our socialized
values of caste first (lack of
intrinsic worth as women) and
then class value judgments.
We tend to value women
according to the type of class
background they seem to be
coming from. The lower it is,
the less value we attribute.

7.11. As new issues of
feminism arise, we create
sub-castes (which is exactly
what we are “programmed” by
the patriarchy to do.) This
prejudice and discrimination
is based on the principle that
anything that threatens the
status quo is evil--i.e., the
system must remain intact at
all costs.

8. The difference between
class & caste is that in a class
system there can be mobility
and in a caste system there
cannot. What determines a
person's values is not the
present class or caste level; it
is the values one was taught
while growing up--how you
see yourself, other women,
the world--what kind of
support you got for what kind
of things.

9. I. “The cause of much
violence in America lies
within the process of allowing
and keeping one third of a
nation poor. This is obviously
linked to the institutionaliza-
tion of social, economic and
practical inequality.” Thomas
Rose, Violence in America

9. II. The caste system is
artificial because it imposes
predetermined values on us
without allowing us to
choose. Society says what our
values should be; not what
they can be.

10. The higher the caste
level, the more resistance to
change.

11. The working caste is
important to any higher castes
only because they provide the
labor to keep the system
running, not because they
have intrinsic worth as indivi-
duals.

12. The heroism of hard
work is not a social value.
Example: the 75-year-old
cleaning woman does not

a given

Janet Sergi

One thing about class, that is painful but is important, is
that each woman is but one man away from the bottom of the
heap. Women derive their economic and social status from their
closest male relative, i.e. father, husband, or brother, in a
patriarchal society.

Any privilege a woman receives comes from her male
guardian. He may be the benevolent father that sends her to
college to learn middle-class values/actions, or he may be the
dictatorial husband that beats and keeps her because he brings
home a paycheck.

The way we think, act, dress and talk are all products of our
class backgrounds. There are no originals. There are only origins:
We must accept the responsibilities of our pasts, to change our
futures. Look at your friends. If you are college educated and
middle-class, lo and behold, so are your charming and clever
friends. Narcissism reigns supreme. If you worked your way
through school, I bet your friends are honest, hard-working, no
bullshit types. Since each tends to think their way is the way, we
women tend to laugh, disregard and belittle other women of
different ethnic, social or class backgrounds.

The patriarchy, the white men in power, love this horizontal
hostility. If women, who are despised by men, despise, gossip
and effectively destroy each other too, then the patriarchy has NO
enemies. To think of acting in a way that makes another woman feel
inferior to yourself helps men control both women. As long as we
keep each other down, we avoid overthrowing the real enemy,
white ruling-class men. Classist ideas are men’s hateful
classifications of all people other than themselves. Men think if
they can classify people as inferior, the people themselves will
believe this propaganda and begin to hate the person just below
them in the male hierarchy of things. “Keep the hens pecking at
each other. And keep the chicks off my back,” are the basic sexist
and classist axioms of the male strategy to divide and conquer
women.

So when we women begin to examine how we oppress
working-class women, what we are really doing is beginning to
examine how deeply the patriarchy has brainwashed us into
hating other women.

Only through a deep and honest probing of our thoughts,
actions and beliefs, can we begin to create honest and loving
relationships with each other. This love that transcends our
patriarchal pasts is the basis for a woman's place, that place in
ourselves, that is truly ourselves; the woman space, the place
where our woman soul resides.

Kathleen Richardson
Special Agent
Lincoln National Life Insurance Company

Being single, 23 and a professional life insurance agent I am
in a unique position to see where the lack of a good estate
planning program has caused unnecessary financial hardships,
deterioration of lifestyles and at times separated families. I have
been with Lincoln National Life Insurance Company long enough
to realize that only a very small number of people have a thorough
knowledge about what insurance really is.

I am going to be writing a series of articles for BIG MAMA
RAG to make you more aware of why a good insurance program is
essential and ways insurance can be to your benefit if you live, die
or quit.

Since the majority of you are single, my articles will deal
with needs of singles. However, I will also include information
dealing with children and husbands as statistics say that they will
be a part of our lives at one time or another.

The articles in the coming months will be covering income
protection, estate planning, maintaining independence, retire-
ment income for yourself, trusts, endowments, hospitalization
coverage and special circumstances caused by marriage, divorce
and children.

These articles will be of interest to you in that most of them
deal with possible situations that can occur and the outcome if
you have or have not taken precautions against unfortunate
occurrences.

Good qualified insurance agents can inform you of various
situations that commonly occur and ways in which you can
protect yourself and those around you.

My first column next month will be concerned with income
protection for the single female and the importance of it with or
without children.

Working Woman’s Account...

From Page 15

and keep me from feeling like
a whole person:

1. There is an assumption
about the ready availability of
money that is just not true for
working-class women. This
assumption extends itself in
many ways. For example, I
bitterly resent being criticized
for working just to earn
money. Middle-class people
often seem to think that the
only good reason to have a job
is if that job has some
redeeming social value. They
don’t seem to understand that
for me, there is only one
choice: to earn a living any
way I can. Earning money is
not a luxury: it’s a necessity
for me. Working-class people
do not have the privilege of
choosing what kind of work
they do: they have to sell their
labor to survive. Middle-class
women have little sensitivity
to my survival problems and
necessities, and very little
awareness of their overriding
intensity and importance to
me.

This also extends to my
hatred of middle-class con-
cern with physical appearance
and dress. I am too busy
earning a living and building
toward a feminist world to
care about those things; they
are not survival priorities. Any
spare money I may happen to
have, I recycle to the feminist
community. Appearance and
dress are at the bottom of the
list, and I get very angry when
other women show by their
attitude or to my face, even,
that they are not impressed by
me because of what I wear or
how I look to them. If my
hands are dirty, it’s because I
have been working hard, and
there is no shame in that. I
resent their clean hands that
help no one and are most
often used to shut doors in my
face. I do happen to like nice
clothes, but I resent the
implication that this is, first of
all, easily available to me, and
second, that I should wear
nice clothes, or that there is
something wrong with me if I
don't.

2. I also resent the frequent
use of rhetoric by middle-class
women. Communicating is
very hard, because I relate
best to plain, straightforward
talk, and I hate women not
saying what they really mean.
That is a male trick that
women have fallen for, and
another form of lying. I’m tired
of assumptions, implications,
and big words that mask gut
feelings. I object to middle-
class mindfuck games that
always avoid the real issues.

This kind of dishonest
communication involves so-
cial skills I never learned, even
though I went to college, and
it leaves me out of their world
in a very significant way. It is
another way of excluding me,
avoiding me, and putting me
down, and I resent it.

3. I hate pseudoliberalism
in the middle class. It is a
posture that breeds the
indiscriminate using of people
for what you can get out of
them. Liberalism is the
privilege of the middle class,
because it is a choice they can
make freely and they do not
have to back up their choices
because they have the power
not to if they choose that.
Radicalism and anarchy are
the only prerogatives of the
working class, that and
revolution. I'm tired of middle
class women agreeing that I
have not had the same
advantages they've had and
how it really is a shame what
society does to us, and then
turning around and using
those same advantages against me (like communication
skills).

4. Middle-class attitudes
breed insensitivity to pain in
others, the tendency to ignore
hassles instead of confronting
them, an unwillingness to
listen, and definite resistance
to change. (How will anything
ever change this way?) If a
middle-class woman can't feel
my pain, she won’t confront
me hassling her, she won't
listen to me when I tell her
how she is fucking me over,
and she damn well won’t give
up one single precious previ-
lege to change.

5. Many middle-class
women have immature atti-
tudes toward personal re-
sponsibility and accountabili-
ty to others. She has a
security and independence
the working-class woman
doesn’t have. Middle-class
women are not open to giving,
whether it’s money (especially
that), friendship, love, or
concern. The middle class is
definitely out to hold on to
what it’s got, even if that
means fucking people over in
the process, and I can’t stand
that.

Any time I have ever really
needed help, it has almost
always been a working-class
woman who has held out her
hand and given me money out
of her working-woman's
pocket, who has taken my
tears gently into the pain of
her own heart, who has led me
fearlessly back to where I
needed to be. What I want to
know is, middle-class women,
WHERE THE HELL WERE
YOU when I was down and
out, you in your houses with
your bank accounts and your
precious privileges?

Women in the feminist
movement are still using the
male privileges of money and
power to put me down, ignore
me, or use me, and I’m sick
and tired of my anger and
frustration being dismissed as
silly, unnecessary or unim-
portant, when the real prob-
lem is that these same women
are perpetuating the worst
evils of the patriarchy by
holding on to those same
privileges that oppress us all
as women. They refuse to
criticize themselves or accept
the fact that THEY are as
much an oppressor as any
man.

A lot of middle-class
women, too, aren’t aware of
what they’re doing. They have
to be TAUGHT not to oppress,
not to perpetuate a system full
of privileges for the few and
out of reach of many,
TAUGHT not to unconsciously
(and probably unwillingly)
serve the patriarchy which is
destroying us.

Any time another woman
puts me down because I am
not knowledgeable, inarticu-
late, indecisive, ill-at-ease,
angry, or worse, because I
have nothing to offer, she
becomes my enemy. She joins
with the patriarchy in oppos-
ing my right to speak, to
learn, to interact, to contri-
bute, to be. She opposes my
working woman's valid pain,
and that is a position I can
only attack in her until she can
meet me, with love, on equal
ground, openly, wanting
nothing. I refuse to listen to her
classist demands until she
has recognized that mine are
far more urgent and have
waited too long. Then --
maybe then -- we can work
together at last. And that is
what has to happen.

Nobody can undo what has
been done. But every feminist
has an overriding obligation to
herself and to her sisters to
thoroughly examine her own
class background and start
getting rid of things in her
head that The Man has put
there and to replace it with
love, respect, and concern for
ALL women.

I still do not personally have
money or power, but I have
words -- and love. I give both
to this struggle, that we may
all arise brave and free and
strong. Working-class women
must unite in solidarity
against their oppression, and
all other women must listen to
our cry. We now demand it, on
the pain of our entire lives.

In the process of the
deification of the system, we
commit ourselves to whatever
values that system wants to
lay on us.
Stepping out of our
roles and abandoning a
middle-class value system is
the same as committing a
societal crime--when we won't
do what we’re “supposed” to
do, we shake up the order of
things as they are. We
threaten the Almighty Sys-

because they are defying the
value system of society twice
over.

The core of all that has been
theoretized about class comes
down to this: the standard in
America revolves around what
is male and young and white
and middle-upper-class. Any
deviation from that ingrained,
mediated standard is sus-
pect. Any judging on that
basis is classist. Any pun-
ishment (mental, physical,
sexual, spiritual) is caste. Any
counteraction to that norm—
any word, gesture, thought,
institutional change—is
freedom. The one most
powerful counter is to change
the very ways we PERCEIVE
that norm: MEDIA.

With no apologies to
McLuhan, I would like to carry
his theories one step further
than he took them. Media are
extensions of our bodies
according to him (i.e. the car
is an extension of our feet, the
telephone an extension of our
mouth and ears, the computer
our brain). More important,
media are not just extensions
of reality, they have become
reality itself.

Since the moon flights,
simulation (models of reality)
has become a familiar con-
cept. We watched a simula-
tion of the moon walks and
landings on TV—reality
twice removed. Football re-
plays are simulations of a sort
and many people prefer
watching the game on TV to
the in-person event. At a
Three Dog Night concert,
people seated way the hell out
from the stage watched the
performance on TV sets.
Once, at Yellowstone National
Park, I watched a man taking
pictures of Old Faithful. He
never looked at the geyser
through the lens of his own
eyes. When the spouting had
died away, he turned to his
family with his Polaroid shots
saying, “Here it is.” The
pictures were for him more an
actual reality than the natural
phenomenon itself. In a
cartoon I read many years
ago, two children are in a car
that has a flat tire. It is
raining, and they are ques-
tioning their father who is
frantically trying to change
the tire. His response, the
caption, reads: “But I can’t
change the channel. This is
reality.” Indeed, reality de-
pends on what channel we are
on.

Does all this seem a bit

removed from the issue of
class? Rethink the looking
glass. TV and Hollywood,
papers and records, books,
and radio, etc. have become
the glasses through which we
look to ascertain reality. Yet
all of them can project an
image that is seemingly real
and false in the truest sense.

Ads are what people usually
focus their criticism on
because they are more obvi-
ous culprits, fostering an
unreal sense of wants and
needs and idealizations. We
know we don’t all fit the
beautiful people in the ads.
Ads for sure are classist in
that they define who is in and
who is out. But ads are part of
content. I am talking about
the very style of media for it is
the nature of their structure
that has become the pseudo
reality. TV exists even if you
never watch it. If you stop
here and argue over content,
and many analyses of media
do, you will end up at the
usual battlefront where the
war against class cannot be
won. You will demand that
women have more power and
prominence in media. You
will demand more Barbara
Walters, more Gloria Stein-
ems. More shows for women,
more women—or minorities—
in ads (remember how a few
years ago a Black in an ad was
obvious tokenism and now it’s
so commonplace that Blacks
themselves are putting out
their own ads of middle-class
Blacks). Cooptation. IBM
knows where it's at. An ad of
theirs reads: IBM, NOT JUST
DATA: REALITY.

Plato’s parable about the
Empyrean cave reads very
much like a multi-media light
show. Humans are chained in
the cave, legs and necks
fettered. They remain in the
same spot, able to look
forward only. A fire burns
behind them, casting sha-
dows on the wall of the cave in
front of them. All they can see
of reality is its reflection. Very
much like this, TV is a
reflection of images—all me-
dia are. Only now we can't tell
the front from the back,
Nature from the simulation,
butter from margarine (it’s not
nice to fool Mother Nature),
man from mediaized man. It is
clear who is chained, but
most of us are still arguing
that the projectionist be

We didn’t have trouble defining a woman's culture
You had trouble understanding it.

A Woman’s Culture. A Woman's civilization.

A world where women can walk the streets without fear of being raped
because they are hated for being women.
A world where war doesn’t rip the earth apart in 100 different places
every year because the men are busy playing with their army trucks.
A world without obscene telephone callers.
A world where people don’t go to prison because they're poor and
their name isn’t Richard Nixon.

A whole world.

changed or liable to equal
opportunity employment.

We have confused our
benchmarks for reality. Hu-
mankind should be the mea-
sure of all things, as indeed
the Renaissance claimed. But
we are measured by our
shadows; our extensions are
our reflections (car, home,
job, TV, etc.).

Trying to see only in the
reflection is where class
enters. For when reality is a
byproduct of perception, then
she who controls the looking
glass and appraises the
extension has power—and
class. We are talking about
equivalents of human beings
in the sense of property and
solely on a material level.
What we need changed is an
essential equation. Mankind
is actually an extension of
himself. We are the Godhead
manifested, God realized in
object form. But we, the
physical equivalents of spir-
it—rather than remerging—
move right as it were
objectifying ourselves even
further:

manifested
GOD = Man = MEDIA
MANifested

Reality encompasses all parts
of this metaphysical, organic
process. We have somehow
evolved to a point where
perception of reality is more
mechanical and dependent on
media rather than taking in the
whole process.

In such a mediaized object
society, it is easy to see how
women have become one
more object or extension of
men. We have developed a
right-sided perception that
moves from man to exten-
sions of man, rather than a
total vision which sees hu-
mans in an equation with the
one, the Ultimate. Women
because they have the innate
capacity to duplicate them-
selves, don’t have to objectify
themselves. Men, because
they cannot, mirror them-
selves in these extensions. They do it rationally, not
bodily, moving more and more
external, away from an inner,
subjective realization of him-
self and reality.

Moving left through that
equation means crawling out
of the cave, not just changing
the projectionist. The cave
metaphor has become like a

Afraid that you will be shot in the back.
Afraid that you will be ridiculed daily.

WIT House

Kim Branscombe

“There is no women’s movement in Denver.” She spoke
bitterly, as one does who has paid her dues and is weary of
promises made but unkept, issues debated but never resolved.

“But what about N.O.W.?,” I said, “What about YWCA?
There’s Big Mama Rag and C.R. groups and the Rape Coalition
and....”

“Intellectualizing. Words and Ideas, consciousness-raising
is done by and for middle-class white feminists. What is there in
Denver for working women? For someone like me—a divorced,
working mother of four? What help—real, concrete help—is there?
None,” she said firmly. I pulled my trump card.

“What about,” I cried triumphantly, “Women in Transition
House?”

“Oh, that place. I bet about half of the women that stay
there have other places to go. They don’t really need to be there.”

“Well, listen. I've spent some time at that house. I’ve seen
that they do refer women to doctors or lawyers or whoever can
help them. And I’m moving in there because I believe that they are

helping women and that’s what I want to do.”

That is the general gist of a
conversation I had three
months ago with the mother
of a friend of mine. Since
then, I have moved into WIT
House and staffed it, some-
times with other women,
sometimes alone. I have seen
five staffers burn out and
leave, and seen about 150
transient women and children
come and go this summer. I've
learned a lot about women,
politics, myself, and the
welfare department—and I've
found that the situation for
Denver women, though far
from ideal, is still not quite as
bleak as my friend's mother
said it was.

There is limited help availa-

ble for working women, and

divorced mothers. Emergency
food can be obtained through
the Food Stamp Department,
Salvation Army, and a few
churches and community ac-
tion centers. With alimony or
custody hassles, they may be
able to get free or cheap legal
help. Legal Aid will not handle
the actual divorce. The NOW
office, Big Mama Rag, WIT
House and the YWCA re-
source center have lists of
women and men lawyers that
sometimes take cases with
little or no fee.

If these women need
counseling and moral sup-
port, WIT House, Gilpin

House, Creative Divorce and
many individual therapists
counsel women or refer them
to someone who can give
them competent, sympathetic
help.

Warren Village, an apart-
ment complex, provides day
care for its resident single-
parent families.

If she is gay, there are
lesbian counselors and
groups in Denver. A national
Lesbian Mothers Defense
Fund is forming.

If she is Chicana and on
welfare, there is a community-
based help organization for
her (See July issue of Big
Mama Rag.)

Denver General Hospital
and Children’s Hospital pro-
vide free health care for
low-income mothers and
children.

If she has been raped, and
needs legal advice, moral
support, etc., she can contact
any of the groups listed in the
August “Rape” issue of Big
Mama Rag.

So on the positive side
there are individuals and
organizations that give time
and energy to help women.
Most of them are understaffed
and underfunded, or require a
lot of form-filling and hassling
with red tape, but they are
there if needed.

However, if a divorced
working mother is being

discriminated against in her
job, needs a bank loan or is
having trouble getting credit—
then she'd better get used to
her situation because, as my
friend’s mother said, there is
nothing. She can go to the
Civil Rights Commission. She
can hire a lawyer if she can
afford one or go to Legal Aid
and hope they take her case.
She can go to the American
Civil Liberties Union; and if
they are going to get a lot of
publicity and are pretty sure
they'll win the case, they may
help her. The last I heard of
Esther Goodyear, she is still
trying to get money together
for a lawyer in her three-year-
old anti-discrimination suit
against Gates Rubber Com-
pany.

This important area is
where Denver women’s
groups are weakest. There is
no powerful, united women’s
group to help with class
action suits. If I am wrong,
please call at WIT House and
tell me, because we get three
or four calls a day from
frustrated, angry women who
are being discriminated a-
gainst.

And if this hypothetical
mother of four is crazy, she
and everyone around her had
better get used to that, too.
There is counseling and
day-care therapy available for
women who are still function-
ing in the community. But the
halfway houses and hospitals
are either expensive or have a
long waiting list. When she
attempts suicide or seriously
hurts someone, then she may
be hospitalized. She may also
have a hard time getting out if
she gets well. Denver's care
for mental patients of any sex
is hideously inadequate.

So much for the traditional
resources that Denver women
have. Enter Women In Transi-
tion House. Yes, good old
much-maligned, crisis-ridden,
understaffed and underfunded
WIT House. For those who
have never heard of it, the
house offers temporary shel-
ter and food for women and
children who are going
through a transition. This may
mean a change of lifestyle,
mental or physical changes.
The staff women make refer-
rals for counseling, food help,
legal help, etc., and do some
non-professional counseling
on their own. The house is
defined as a “safe place” so
women make a contract when
they come in not to harm
themselves or anyone else.
When they break this con-
tract, they are asked to leave.

WIT House...

From Page 17

Each woman is expected and  
encouraged to clean up her  
messes and her children’s,  
and to take steps to solve her  
own problems.

But the house is definitely  
not just a haven for white  
middle-class feminists. One  
night in mid-August I took  
inventory of the women  
staying there:

One German - Kentuckian  
with three daughters

One Psychotic Jesus Freak  
in her 20's

An exotic dancer, 19 and  
one German shepherd

An ex-jailbird with two  
huge dogs

An alcoholic Sioux woman,

One 60-year-old derelict

A former alcoholic and  
mental patient

A radical lesbian with a  
sheepdog

A divorcee with a baby

A divorced woman with  
two children, hiding from her  
drunk husband

A former junkie and apart-  
ment manager

One newly-divorced 40-  
year-old waitress

A gay couple with one  
four-year-old child and two  
cats

One middle-class white  
feminist with a cat

That's a total of fifteen  
women, seven children, four  
dogs and three cats. Seven  
were on welfare or trying to  
be. Two were in physical  
danger. Eight had nowhere  
else to stay. Typically, 50% of  
the transients are hassling  
with the welfare department;  
20% are fleeing from brutal  
husbands or boyfriends; 20%  
are in non-crisis situations.  
This is defined as that they are  
crashing in town, or having  
some other place to stay but  
needing to be among a  
supportive group of women  
for a few days to straighten  
out their heads.

And, finally, there is the  
energy-draining 10% of wo-  
men who are alcoholics, drug  
addicts, rip-offs, or mentally  
disturbed. They are the main  
reason for high burn-out and  
rapid staff turnover.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 4

The women on welfare are, I  
think genuinely helped by  
their stay at WIT. They at least  
get support and good advice  
and a roof over their heads  
while they hassle with the  
bureaucrats. The women run-  
ning from dangerous men  
have a frustrating way of  
sometimes returning to the  
same unchanged situation.  
Most of the time, however,  
they manage to leave town,  
get counseling, get a divorce,  
a restraining order, or whatev-  
er is necessary for safety.  
Maria came here, for example,  
with her two children. Her  
husband had been beating her  
up for most of the year. She  
was exhausted and fright-  
ened. She left her kids at her  
mother-in-law’s one day and  
her husband kidnapped them  
and took them to Texas. After  
a long time, spending $300 on  
a lawyer, and many disap-  
pointments she got them  
back. Then her husband was  
put on a restraining order and  
the house was locked up for  
three days. A place out of town  
was found for her and she  
finally was able to get money  
to fly herself and her children  
to a new city.

The women who come to  
get their heads together away  
from husband, family, etc. are  
also sometimes able to figure  
out alternatives to the roles,  
games, or lifestyle they are  
having trouble with. Again,  
this depends on the individual  
woman. The remaining 10%, I  
am sorry to say, are not likely  
to be helped much by WIT or  
any other agency. Often, they  
have been bounced around  
from agency to institution like  
a human tennis ball for most  
of their life, and all of the  
social workers, social psychi-  
atrists, counselors, rehabili-  
tation centers, reform  
schools, hospitals, and jails  
have only worsened the  
frustration, self-hatred, and  
despair that many of these  
women feel. Lucy had gone  
from institution to institution  
all of her life. She came here  
directly from jail, where she  
had been held on suspicion of  
robbery and released without  
charges. Her boyfriend was  
still in jail, her car was in  
hock, and her dogs were in the  
kennel at a charge of $12 a  
day. She was angry, hopeless  
and uptight about being here.  
She distrusted any attempts  

Through A Class Darkly

box that has restricted our  
vision on one inhibiting level  
of reality--a level that sees  
people as objects and not  
process.

Media in and of itself is  
classless; it is only a tool.  
Humans define the use of  
tools, and since that human  
has mostly been male, it has  
often meant that perceptions  
of women in history have not  
been her story. History, which  
is print media in its most  
ancient guise, has been a  
mirror in which women have  
either been missing or dis-  
torted. Yet history is western  
civilization’s basis for truth.  
Lesbians, in particular, have  
been seen through the glass  
darkly. Religious articles are  
still being written showing  
Lesbians as pawns of the  
devil, though ironically the  
Biblical quotations are often  
attributed to Paul, as bitter a  
misogynist as ever lived.  
Writers from the Denver Post,  

“picture with a  

in their role as present day  
historians, just recently took a  
wide angle lens at close range  
cleverly making four beautiful  
women seem like depraved  
outcasts. But if print media is  
our history, electronic media is  
our future. This fact is  
relevant to women of all  
classes. We all watch TV; we  
all go to the movies. But  
unless we are aware of the  
way media filters reality and  
fosters notions of class, we  
cannot begin to counteract it.

Both class and media  
overpower any attempts wo-  
men may make at self-defini-  
tion. If they begin to see class  
as one dehumanizing aspect  
of media, one more extension  
of male society, then class  
can be put in its proper  
perspective. When we keep  
seeing ourselves as objects, it  
becomes easier to align  
people into material levels of  
value. This is what has  

happened in a society which  
pays more attention to its  
objects and extensions rather  
than to its emotional and  
spiritual ties to life processes.  
Media used to view the world  
in such a distorted way are  
inferior products of an inferior  
process.

Women, then, must stop  
copying this male model. That  
means setting up a system of  
communications which de-  
fines people, and especially  
women, in terms of her  
spiritual being. Women need  
to kill the onus of class with a  
reflection of vision back to the  

One, for woman is the  
Feminine principle made  
manifest, not media made  
manifest.

Separatism is a word used  
to scare us. But as it is  
obvious that women need to  
separate themselves from a  
system of economics where  
money becomes the definition  
of worth, it should be obvious  
that we also need to separate  
ourselves from the whole way  
our society has of looking at  

reality, especially when we  
sense we are restricted on one  
level of reality, and that, badly  
distorted in someone else’s  
image. Creating for ourselves  
an alternate media means  
insisting on reordering our  
levels of perception both as  
senders and receivers. We  
must devise verbs and pic-  
tures, newspapers and TV  
programs, philosophical es-  
says, radio--all media--that  
will speak for us in terms of  
our original relationship to  
matter. That creation is a  
return to that level of reality  
where class hierarchy is not  
possible, for it is a return to a  
person-to-person perspective  
that is not a function of media  
but of woman soul.

Sandia

mediaized = propagandized,  
mind-controlled, conditioned by media.

This idea is forcefully  
developed by Ti-Grace Atkin-  
son in her book Amazon  
Odyssey (New York, 1973)

to help her. Finally, she  
attacked and hurt two women.  
It became obvious at the end  
that she was mentally unbal-  
anced. When she hurt two  
women in an all-out psychotic  
“attack”, we tried to get her  
hospitalized. Denver General  
Hospital promised to take her,  
but then turned her out on the  
street. There was no other  
place for her to go and the last  
I heard, she was crashing with  
a man who periodically traded  
sex for shelter.

I have learned a lot from  
WIT House. I learned how  
responsibility can weigh like  
concrete on the shoulders.  
I've learned to shrug off that  
responsibility when it threat-  
ens to crush me to the  
ground. I’ve learned the  
limitations of the social  
service agencies. I have some  
inkling of what an awesome  
task it is going to be to topple  
this stifling, patriarchal bu-  
reaucracy. I can do a lot of  
household maintenance when  
I need to now. I can  
sometimes cool down a fight.  
I feel much more comfortable  
with my identity as a woman, a  
sexual, political, feeling,  
thinking, doing being. It still  
hurts to see the self-destruct-  
ive trips my sisters get into,  
but I also see them getting  
stronger, and so I can’t  
despair yet.

So I can say now, looking  
back on that conversation  
with my friend's mother, that  
she was too cynical and I was  
too naive. The women’s  
movement is far from being a  
powerful, cohesive force for  
change in Denver. We cannot  
yet throw down the bureau-  
cracies and crush the institu-  
tions that degrade and brutal-  
ize women and children. What  
we can do is provide alterna-  
tives to these institutions.  
Women are changing, in their  
roles, self-images, expecta-  
tions, and perceptions of  
society. WIT House, with all  
of its crises is still a good  
place to go through changes.

Something to think about,  
ponder if you will: recently a  
woman was offered a freelance  
position with an organization and a sum was quoted  
which sounded good at first.  
But after several contacts and  
some soul-searching, she  
negotiated with a representa-  
tive that her knowledge was  
invaluable, but intangible. The  
final result was that she was  
paid three times the amount  
first offered when she con-  
fronted the organization for  
more money.  

Do we as women underestimate  
our value to the business  
structure? Would it help us to  
be more self-confident and  
self-assertive? What would it  
hurt? We can only be denied.

On July 1st of this year, a  
women’s retreat opened in a  
gorgeous cabin located on the  

response to our letter in  
the August issue of  

and the varied needs  
expressed by women who have  
already attended the retreat  
indicate the need for greater  
facilities that would be con-  
trolled and owned by women.  
A 23-acre site has been found  
in the Adirondack forest in  
upstate New York. The  
property includes a large main  
house, several cabins, a  
converted barn, and a large  
pond.  

Because of the diversity of  
the facilities we see the  
possibility of meeting the  
needs of many different  
women; women with child-  
ren; women who want to be  
alone; women interested in as  
much interaction with other  
women as possible; women  
who wish to visit for a long  
time or just a few days. Space  
could be utilized as work-  
shops, shops, a coffee house,  
a feminist library, for women’s  
art.  

What is needed to make it  
all work is energy in the form  
of women with skills to share,  
women willing to invest  
money and/or time. OUR

Women and Therapy

a psychological adventure

Franci Candlin, Carol Lease, and Sandia

If it has been several thousand years that men have controlled the public lives of women, it has been nearly a hundred that the attitudes of Freud and his followers have commandeered our psyches. It is against their prescribed conventions of mental health and treatment that Anne Wilson Schaef has been devoting her practice, and her energies have been in the direction of women defining and establishing their own psychological models.

The process of unlearning traditional psychological theories began about six years ago for her. Although the change in Schaef has been evolutionary, the main catalyst was a workshop on Community Development sponsored by The National Training Laboratories. She relates that people in the institute quickly split along racial and sexual lines. On the second day of the workshop, the Black members caucused, a decision that the group as a whole respected. However, on the fourth day when the women decided likewise to caucus, their actions were met with disbelief, paternalism, and extreme defensiveness on the part of the male staff. The significance of this event for Schaef was to arouse in her an awareness of the negative reactions of men toward women who dared to step out of the White Male System (WMS).

Problem of Rage

Soon after, she decided to focus on formulating theories and techniques relevant to women. Following several workshops with women, she began to witness their intense, terrifying rage which she admits was a frightening experience for her. She realized that she had to deal with her own rage before she could help women with theirs. She illustrated the inability of many therapists to cope with their clients’ rage. They encourage patients to explore their feelings, but when these feelings are expressed as rage, then frequently they resort to tranquilizers rather than confront the existing emotions.

Such attitudes only heighten the alienation women already feel. Schaef refers to a recurring fantasy of women which exemplifies this isolating aspect of rage. In this fantasy, the woman pictures herself standing all alone in smoldering ruins following the explosion of a hydrogen bomb. Schaef interprets this imagery as meaning that women feel that if they allowed themselves to express the full intensity of their anger, they would be capable of devastating the whole world, leaving her totally isolated.

Schaef encourages women to get in touch with their rage using the modality of a group as their support system. She feels this is crucial as the main fear of women is isolation from men and later on estrangement from other women if they were to give vent to this rage. Thus the importance of groups in therapy. The group can be of assistance in this painful process because women know that the group will not desert them, and they can use the collective experience of the group to validate their own feelings.

One method for working through the rage phase which Schaef has utilized is a “rage room.” This is a place where the only guidelines are that the individual cannot directly harm herself or any other person. In the instance of one school teacher, she expressed her rage by chopping up a desk. Although this technique bears some resemblance to Primal Therapy, unlike Primal which has become a “belief” system providing an “answer,” and which contrives rage, this approach stays out of the way of the client and deals with what naturally emerges.

Following this emotional catharsis, the cognitive phase of therapy must begin. Now

Ann Schaef, feminist therapist.

Schaef encourages women to explore what she terms as her “Original Sin” theory. This derives from a woman's perception that she is born innately inferior to men by reason of her sexual class.

She seeks to rid herself of this second-class status by attaching herself to a man. However, much to her dismay, she fails to find the superior man who can be the outside intermediary that will make everything okay, and so the void continues. At this crisis point, women too often reach the conclusion that something must be wrong with them individually. Somewhere they must have personally failed. Schaef uses the group to help women distinguish for themselves which problems result from being members of a certain class—and most women take their identity from men—and which problems arise from their own personality patterns.

An Emerging Feminist Theory

Schaef has devised the following theoretical construct as a way of explaining the difficulties women have coping with the White Male System (WMS).

note: see graph

Schaef states that most traditional therapy focuses on either the intrapsychic level (problems within the individual) or at best on the interpersonal level (problems arising between family and friends). However, unless the pervasive influence of the WMS is recognized and accounted for, many problems will be erroneously viewed as primarily personal or interpersonal in nature rather than as a spin-off of the WMS refusing to accept or respect the beliefs and values of other subsystems.

The WMS comes complete with its own mythology and rhetoric. In part that reads: “The WMS knows and understands everything.” In other words, it becomes a belief system, too, assuming there is only one “rite” way. Like a religion convinced of the Truth, the WMS sees no need to look at any of the subsystems’ ways of perceiving reality. In actuality, those in the subsystems (Chicanos, Blacks, women, etc.) know the most about the WMS as they have had to scrutinize it closely trying to decide why they are never fully accepted by it. More important, they have had to know it as a survival tactic.

The thrust of the Women’s Movement has been the awareness that there are other systems, and they are not innately inferior. Moreover, each system comes complete with its own politics, its own philosophy, and in a sense its own religion. That is why it is impossible for a therapist to be apolitical or aphilosophical. And this is why women need to understand how they as part of the female system might operate necessarily different than men. One example of differentiating the female and male systems is our attitude toward time. Male time is measured, controlled, regulated by numbers. Female time is process. Rather than thinking in terms of clocks or intervals, women think in terms of completing one task and when that is finished or when a gestalt is completed, they move on; if they need more time they get it. This attitude toward time becomes especially valuable when applied to time segments allotted for therapy appointments. If a client needs more than the usual hour, she gets it and all of Schaef's clients share that understanding.

Schaef's model provides an alternative framework for viewing mental health as a process of problem solving rather than as a cure for an illness. She further explains that the word neurosis is also male-oriented and based on a traditional medical model which sees psychological realities in terms of such stereotypes as sickness and health. From this perspective, the relationship between therapist and “patient” is intrinsically authoritarian and hierarchical. The therapist diagnoses the sickness and prescribes the cure. A feminist orientation sees a problem as an opportunity for growth. When growth as a natural process is interfered with, then certain symptoms become manifest. What women must recognize is that people have the dynamics of maturing within them and need not be manipulated from without.

In feminist therapy, then, the role of the therapist becomes “a model for coping, not a perfected individual.” Thus, she shares herself and her problems with other group members and encourages them to relate to each other outside the sphere of the group. This sense of peer-direction can sustain a continuing network of support across the country.

Usual Money Bind

Her work is without conflict. As a feminist who sees herself in a primary commitment to women, Anne Schaef is caught in the “service/occupation” dilemma shared by many professional women. That is, as a professional and a working woman she needs to charge for her services though she is aware that some of the women who need her help the most cannot often afford to pay for it. Yet, she is keenly aware that women in this society need to be paid and recognized for their efforts. What does a woman do who has been working since sixth grade and has children to support and there are clients with outstanding debts that range into the thousands? She struggles. While there are certain fees, Schaef negotiates. Some women are capable of paying $30/hour, some are not able to pay anything. Schaef has had to resolve this problem of remuneration on an individual basis, working out with her clients their needs and hers. Since some women see her privately, or in groups, and still others for occasional weekend workshops, she tries to arrange sessions that suit the clients’ financial status.

Future Outlook

Schaef has not only trained women nationally on her views of therapy, but is presently working on a book which would delineate a feminist model. Her aim is to convey how women feel and experience the world and then to take a critical look at the differences between the female and male systems, with

Dear BMR:

Opportunities to praise press coverage of Colorado’s incredible prison non-system are so rare that I'm certainly not going to pass one up. Your September issue was excellent -- from the standpoint of philosophy as well as content.

There is something profoundly wrong with a “correctional” system that teaches subservience and demands self-degradation as the price of day-to-day existence. Volumes could -- and, I hope, will -- be written on the dichotomy between what penologists claim to be doing in prisons and what is actually being done. In the meantime, BMR has performed an invaluable public service by providing a forum for women who understand how the pig behaves when there is no longer a need for chivalry.

Mary Louise Aragon and Ronnell Lee know the prison. That their observations and criticisms have implications for all women and oppressed people in general goes without saying. I hope we'll be hearing more from them, and I hope that BMR will continue to publish articles by, for and about women in prison.

Dear Big Mama,

“Shecat” used this column last month as a forum to voice her/his displeasure at the “MANagement” of the August 25th Women’s Festival. “Shecat” made some disparaging accusations of what s/he called the “leadership” of the Festival. As one of the food coordinators of the Festival, some of those remarks were directed towards me. I can handle that since obviously “Shecat” doesn’t know what s/he is talking about even on the very simplest issue of the economics and logistics of providing food for hundreds of women and men. At this point I feel no urgency or even vague desire to educate the ignorant. If “Shecat” had really been concerned, then during the planning stages of the Festival s/he would have had every opportunity to know what was transpiring. But, the First Amendment lives and “Shecat” can make her/his accusations, no matter how irresponsible.

However, I personally do have an incredible sense of urgency to respond to “Shecat” on an issue of timeless importance to the Women’s Movement. In her/his letter, “Shecat” wrote that “What I object to so much is the lack of trust between us...” “Shecat” went on to say, “I am more willing to learn if I know there is love, and that is what we have to start trusting if we are to build a strong and vital women’s community in Denver.” “In the process, let’s see that our learning is open, so that we can all share.” Nice words... Well expressed. Vitally important to the growth of feminism. “Shecat” further stated, “Any woman who needs to fall back on old patterns and processes is denying herself the most important experiences she may ever have -- sharing and learning on a gut level with other women, helping and BEING helped.” More nice words. Very well expressed. Incredibly important to the nurturance of feminism.

I have a huge problem, though with “Shecat’s” statements: Wouldn’t it be neat if s/he really meant what s/he said? Wouldn't it be neat if s/he listened to her/himself? Wouldn't it be neat if s/he could involve her/himself in the process of those statements instead of pontificating from the sidelines? Wouldn't it be neat if “Shecat” could also be “open” in “love and struggle”? Wouldn't it be neat if “Shecat” could have at least signed her/his name to the letter. It’s so easy to talk about trusting and being open. Cheap cheap words. Terry Miller

Shecat,

It makes me very sad that you and I must correspond with one another through this wall of anonymity — how much nicer it would be to communicate in person. The anonymous mask -- for whatever your reasons -- makes me even more sad on a larger scale. You obviously are a sensitive, caring person with deep personal feelings for the Women’s Movement in Denver. I believe you and I share a commitment to the love and struggle involved in the process, in the realization and actualization of our (women’s) needs and goals. But what really saddens me, Shecat, is that there must be something going on here in the Denver women’s community that prevents you from being really up-front with your views; something that holds you back from wanting to take responsibility for what you say and for what you believe in. What is that? What can we do about it? How can we share our trust and love and growth when we can’t even address one another? You know how to get in touch with me. I can only wish that you felt or you wanted to and that you felt you could be safe in being open.

Terry Miller

Dear Big Mama,

My reasons for using a pseudonym have been important to me. However, I agree that some issues are more important than my own personal hassles, and this is one of them. Terry is right on, as usual, and I appreciate her straightforwardness. Therefore, I say publicly that I am Shecat, in openness, love, and struggle.

-Nancy Boyd

Dear Big Mama Rag;

I was most impressed with your issue concentrating on Women in Prison. I am enrolled in the University Without Walls program at Loretto Heights College and would like to expand my interest in prison reform. My involvement in the Women’s Movement is extensive so I would like to concentrate on the plight of women prisoners.

Do you have any suggestions of areas that I might be of service? Living where I am presents a problem.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Penny Gardner

At last there is a health
clinic in Denver that will give
us thorough medical care;
that will teach us about
keeping our bodies healthy;
that will teach us about keeping
our bodies healthy; that takes
a feminist viewpoint of our
problems in the male-dominated
social and medical
worlds; and that doesn’t rip
us off with high medical fees.

Creative Health Services,
which is located at 4645 East
Colfax Ave., began in 1972 as
an idea of a group of nurse
practitioners. Realizing the
oppressive nature of the
traditional doctor-nurse and
doctor-patient relationships,
the 16 RNs (13 of whom hold
master's degrees in nursing)
set out to make it on their
own.

The group sought to
advance the nurses’ role in the
eyes of the public, to
establish an independent
economic base for nurses,
and at the same time to offer
responsive health care to
women and the larger
community. The solution
seemed to be a clinic - a
nurses clinic that the working
staff would create, control
and direct. Money to open the
clinic was raised by $300
investment from each staff
member. There is no govern-
ment or foundation funding.
With equal financial shares
and equal positions in the
clinic, each member would
have equal say in the
operations, creating a non-
competitive and supportive
atmosphere.

Clinic For Whom?
A clinic for whom, though?

And offering what services? -

“We felt that higher income
people had no problem with
adequate medical care, and
that good care is also offered
through the Denver hospitals
for those who are destitute,
even though they do not
always know how to obtain it.
We also felt, however, that
low-middle income people
were not offered good medical
care at a price they could
afford. These people have
been our target group,”
claimed Rorry Zahourek, an RN
from the clinic.

With help from the Denver
chapter of NOW, studies were
conducted to determine the
geographic location of the
target group. The clinic was
then located according to data
gathered from the studies.

At the same time, the
nurses began to consider
their operational goals and
problems as well as the
specific services the clinic
could offer. The clinic decided
to have a “wellness” orientation
to promote health and
prevent illness, and to teach
people how to deal with their
chronic illnesses. Pediatrics,
maternity and family plan-
ning, adult medical surgical,
and psychiatric mental health
would comprise the major
areas of practice.

A First for Nurses

Creative Health Services
was officially opened in
December of last year. The
first clinic in Denver to be
staffed entirely by nurse prac-
titioners, the venture was
initially met with skepticism
by the local medical estab-
lishment. The efforts of CHS
to keep their cohorts infor-
med, however, has gone a
long way toward easing that
initial concern. “We now have

a good relationship with other
areas of the medical profes-
sion,” stated Frank Lane, the
only male member of the CHS
team.

An advisory board was
formed to augment the clinic
staff. It is composed of RNs
and doctors and includes a
social worker, an environ-
mental economist, a health
planner, and a consumer
counselor. This board has
proved itself vital, both in
terms of the clinic and
patients, and in maintaining
communications and under-
standing between CHS and
the medical profession of
Denver.

Most patients at CHS are
women who live within a ten
mile radius of the clinic. Many
nurses as well as older
people, children and minority
groups come to CHS.

In addition to physical
health care the organization
offers community programs
that have been highly success-
ful. Focusing on the prob-
lems of being a woman in
today's society, the programs
emphasized women's self-
concept, with special empha-
sis on assertiveness training.
Response was so favorable
that CHS is considering
sponsoring another similar
workshop if community needs
and interests indicate.

Offering improved alterna-
tives for patients, Creative
Health Services provides hyp-
nosis therapy for smoking
(which they say has been
partially effective) and for pain
control with good results.

Emphasis on Teaching

Preventive health care re-
quires knowledge of one's
body and how to care for it. A
physical for women, for

example, includes not only a
pelvic exam, pap smear, and
breast exam, but instruction
in doing self-breast exams
and in how our body works.
You are told about the special
medical and health needs of
women and how to keep
healthy.

One patient told us, “I have
never been so involved with
my own physical. Every step
of the way everything was
explained to me, I was

encouraged to participate in
parts of the exam, and was
educated to my body in a
way that I have never been. I
was a participant rather than a
mannequin on a table being
worked over by some ‘profes-
sional’.”

As yet, CHS does not teach
pelvic self-exams, but is most

“Everything About me is fine

Members of the all-woman cast are practicing for their November 7 performances.

Two one-act plays written
and performed by women will
be presented at the Changing
Scene, 1527½ Champa (be-
tween 15th and 16th on
Champa in downtown Denver)
beginning on Thursday, Nov-
ember 7th. The plays will
begin at 8:30 on Thursdays,
Fridays, and Saturdays, the
7th thru the 9th and the 14th
thru the 16th. It will begin at
7:30 on the two Sundays, the
10th and 17th of November.

The two plays, in alphabeti-
cal order, are Kathia by Janet
McReynolds and The Thrilling
Life of a Circus Performer
Will One Day Be Yours by
Theresa Marffie-Evangelista.

Kathia is a gothic tale set in
San Francisco about a woman
who takes a room in the house
of an older woman. The older
woman has been renting
rooms for years so she could
increase her “adopted daugh-
ters” in a special, hidden
room. The mental process
that will ultimately end in the
possession of one person over
another begins soon after the
young woman moves into the
house and discovers the true
identity of the landlady. The
house comes to represent the
woman's life and her actions
determine her survival.

Janet McReynolds who has
also written and published a
book (that is now out of print)
“I Have a Great Desire,” which
is about the relationships
between a woman, a soldier,
and a yet to be born child. The
playwright also writes a
column in the “other” Boulder
daily (the Colorado Daily
being THE daily in Boulder,)
and will be giving a reading of
her poetry at the University of
Colorado in the UMC on
December 10th.

The Thrilling Life of a
Circus Performer Will One Day
Be Yours is a play about the
relationships of women to
women. The main character,
who is portrayed by two
actresses, is at a crisis-deci-
sion making point of her life.
The play shows her relation-
ships with different women in
different periods and aspects
of her life, and it depicts her
loss and the loss of all
women. But in the words of
Diane McDaniel, a woman
involved in the play, “Life
doesn't let you resolve any-
thing. It just goes on.”

Some of the women who
have been working together in
the play say that they have
really gotten to know each
other and other women’s
feelings and have developed
close friendships with each
other through the weeks of
rehearsals. Says Stephanie
Nellhaus, who plays the part
of Mary, the daughter of one
of the women, “I have a good
understanding of women
through this play.”

It is much easier to do a
play with all women cast
members than with men and
women, says one member of
the play's cast. Male actors
don't seem to work as hard.
Women are more dedicated,
give each other support and
have more empathy for their
character and for each other.

Theresa Marffie-Evangelista
has written other plays, is
from New York.

Rick Collier is the director
of both one-act plays and is
currently appearing in
“Championship Season” at
the Gaslight Theatre in Den-
ver. He receives good reviews
from the players and members of
both casts. He works directly
with each individual and is
easy to get along with,
something which can’t be said
for most other directors.
Since the play is about
women, he relies on the cast
members to interpret the roles
instead of putting his “own
ideas of what women should
feel and how women should
act in the play. He seems to
give the cast the freedom they
need to use their own
experiences as women in the
play."

Preserving a healthy sense of who we are and what being a
woman means in this society calls for a legal perspective that is
feminist. As the case of Inez Garcia illustrates, there are
differences in the way men and women view the law—and the law,
because it can support or destroy us, is one concept that women
should understand.

Under the terms of the law as now written, Inez Garcia is guilty.
The law does not see rape as an offense which justifies
self-defense even to the extent of killing one’s oppressor. All laws
reflect our values and feelings; what society feels is important.
The society is male, those who write the laws are male; therefore
the laws themselves are male biased.

If women were writing the laws, they would know internally the
significance of rape and the response that action justifies. Rape
violates the essence of women. As such, it is the ultimate threat to
our identity and self-worth. Under the laws of a matriarchy, rape
would be a primary transgression. Implied and stated by law
would be a respect for women’s autonomy and their inherent right
to control their bodies, their property.

The issue of property has been raised before in the feminist
analysis of rape. Over and over again the system has viewed
women as property—men’s property. Any attempt by women to
defend their bodies is struck down by the courts even though the
crime of rape has been shown not to be an act of passion, but one
of violence and transgression. This attitude reveals how the
system persists in viewing women: they are for the use of men.
There is either a conscious or covert conspiracy on the part of men
to keep women from being human beings with equal dignity. The
law as it stands supports the male violators because the essence
of the law is dedicated to supporting the patriarchy. Perhaps this
explains why rape is the fastest growing crime of violence in the
country.

The traditional assumption that the courts can be an objective
and impartial forum is a fallacy. If the convictions of Inez Garcia
and other victimized women are allowed to stand, they will
reinforce the demeaning stature to which women have been
reduced—everyone's property but our own. The law will not be a
precedent for the enlightenment and education of the country—it will
become license for men to use women as they see fit.

The laws on rape must be rewritten by women.

Discrimination against women, however and whenever it
occurs, no matter how subtle it may be, must be recognized,
confronted, and eliminated. The present existence of law and
legislative reform will never eliminate sexist politics, policies, and
practices. We will have to do it ourselves.

Sex discrimination is elusive. It is often so interwoven into
the very fabric of life that its opposition seems ludicrous or a
“waste of time.” Its opposition won't be easy. It can only be made
easier by the support of others... by people who refuse to see
women as “inferior” and helpless and powerless.

The fact that women have to pay more often to use public
facilities than men is being challenged by the Women’s Coalition
to End Pay Toilets. This practice, the coalition says, is in violation
of the Public Accommodations Act that ensures all people equal
protection under the law. The coalition may take the practice into
the civil courts, and they deserve the support of all women.

All women suffer in some way from inadequate, sexist, racist
health care. And if a woman is poor, it is very likely that her health
problems will be greater and her opportunities to receive good
care will be less.

This country spends billions of dollars a year on health care but
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.
Pre-natal care is almost non-existent in most counties and cities
in this country.

Preventive medicine is largely ignored in the medical system of
this country. Symptoms are treated while the rest of the body and
the mind are ignored. Germs, microbes, and viruses cause disease
in the minds of the healers. The social context is largely ignored.
Most large hospitals have impressive research programs and
focus on profit-making before patient care.

The treatment and cure of cervical cancer has been known for 15
years, but women continue to die from it. A simple test can detect
this form of cancer, but the medical establishment has a hard time
recognizing its responsibility toward providing health care and
health education inexpensively for all women.

Women as nurses and other medical care workers compose
75% of all health workers in the country and are restricted to the
most menial and lowest paying jobs in the system. Only 7% of all
physicians in the US are women. Exclusive policies of medical
schools and sexist education in general keep women and
minorities a small proportion of all doctors in this country. There
are fewer doctors per person than 50 years ago due to
“professional birth control” practiced by the medical profession
since the days of the Depression.

Sisterhood Express

Sisterhood Express is the future feminist newspaper of
Tucson, Arizona. At this time we do not have the people energy or
the financial resources to become a full-fledged publication on
our own. By joining forces with Big Mama Rag and becoming an
insert in this paper, we hope to become a reality while we are
gathering the strength and skills to fly on our own. Here is our
statement of purpose as formulated in July, 1974.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

Sisterhood Express is a group of Tucson women coming
together from varied places with much experience and
many skills to share equality in providing a common
forum for the voice of the Tucson Woman.

The goals of the newspaper are:

1. To publish news of the women’s movement from local,
national, and international perspectives.

2. To provide an outlet for expression of creative skills of
local women in literary and graphic arts.

3. To identify and document incidents of sexism, ageism,
and racism in our community.

4. To provide commentary on news and issues from a
feminist viewpoint.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

At this time, Sisterhood Express (SHE) has no formalized
organizational structure. Because we are firmly committed to
developing a non-hierarchical organization (we view hierarchical
organizations as one of the vehicles of oppression in our society),
we have been reluctant to structurally define ourselves at all.

This does not mean that we are not organized. Right now
SHE is a loosely structured collective. Task-oriented committees
are formed and terminate as specific tasks emerge and are
accomplished. As we grow and develop, the committees will
stabilize and become our structure. As we see it now, each
committee will have a coordinator. When we incorporate, the
Committee Coordinators will become our Board. Coordinators will
serve for a specified time only, so that everyone will have a share
in the “leadership” of SHE and share in the responsibility.

We welcome all input about the pros and cons of non-
hierarchical organizations. We are interested in
hearing about any of your experiences or efforts in this direction.

BMR, SHE RELATIONSHIP

According to our present thinking, BMR and SHE will be
structurally and editorially independent and autonomous. BMR
will act as a support system for the birth and development of SHE.
In return, BMR will benefit from the increased distribution and the
infusion of energy from SHE.

We at Sisterhood Express are very excited about the liaison
with BMR. It is especially interesting from a political viewpoint,
since it represents one feminist newspaper giving birth to another.
This would seem to present an innovative alternative to the
standard competitively oppressive process of creating such an
organization.

PROSPECTIVE SHE CONTENT

The Sisterhood Express insert will cover a broad range of
material of interest to the women of Tucson and the southwest.
We want to keep our format very flexible so that we can
experiment with different ways of utilizing the space. We may
want to present a combination of news, features, and poetry one
month. Another month we may wish to utilize the space all for one
thing, such as an investigative report or graphics and
photographs.

Our main criteria is that material be of interest and value to
women in particular. News and features about Tucson women
and services for Tucson women will be given priority. We are
interested in educating, entertaining, developing consciousness,
and providing alternative self-images for women.

With these goals in mind, here is a list of some of the
material being gathered for publication in Sisterhood Express:
features on feminist activities and organizations in Tucson such
as the Lesbian Alcoholics Anonymous Group, The Rape Crisis
Center, Alternatives For Women; an article on mother-lesbian
daughter relationships; a mental health column called “How’s
Your Head?”, discussing such topics as “What is Mental Health”,
“The Effects of Oppression on the Mental Health of Women”,
“Feminist Counseling”, and “How To Choose A Therapist”; news
and features of women in sports; coverage of special events, such
as the WITCHES (Women in Tucson Celebrating Halloween)
Retreat.

MEMBERSHIP IN SISTERHOOD EXPRESS

SHE welcomes all material submitted by Tucson women.
Send your material to: Sisterhood Express, P.O. Box 27727,
Tucson, AZ 85726. We would also like to hear opinions from all
BMR readers on this idea and the items we eventually publish.

Tucson women who are interested in being a part of the
SHE organization are welcome at our weekly meetings. These are
held on Saturday afternoons, at 2:00 p.m. at the Tucson Women’s
Center, 912 East Sixth Street, Tucson, AZ. After attending three
(3) meetings, a woman can become a voting member.

Responses to Class Analysis
Dear People,

I would like to answer the
“Analysis Part 2” in the
October BMR in which it
is stated “for middle class
women their work is not a
material necessity but an
attempt to achieve fulfillment
or escape boredom under the
illusion that somehow their
jobs are beneficial to the
world.”

I am concerned that the
“Analysis” and the article “A
Working Class Perspective”
tries to hang a middle class
woman with some of the very
same things that men try to
hang on middle class women.
I would suggest your reading
Survival in the Sexual Jungle
by Andrew Dee Brin, Ph.D.

Middle class women who
work outside the home more
often than not are working—not
for the trivial things (and who
decides what is trivial?) but
many times work so that the
family can survive—and not in
the lap of luxury either!

We are all guilty of classist
remarks and thoughts. It will
be nice when we can all be rid
of these barriers and accept
all people for what they are.
Why do we need to put anyone
down? We have all been
programmed in our thinking
and need to become more
aware; but being full of rage
and uncontrollable anger does
not help anyone, and anyone
who says he or she is not
prejudiced about something
or someone is not being
honest. But being willing and
able to change old ideas when
we are presented with new
thoughts is what we all need
to strive for.

In Personhood,

Dear Big Mama,

Can’t tell you how exciting
it has been for me to read the
last two issues of Big Mama
Rag. I’ve been out of town for
two months, and I have
returned to find what I
consider to be some of the
finest articles ever.

Particularly, articles like “A
Working Class Perspective”
(October) and the article on
the Feminist School (September)
reflect the depth of
thought and the diversity of
opinion that goes into the
writing of Big Mama Rag. I
have always felt that one of the
strengths of the Women’s
Movement lies in the fact that
controversy is not sup-
pressed. But rather sensitive
consideration and basic re-
spect is given to women from
a wide range of life experiences
and with differing personal
views of Feminism.

After reading those articles,
I was once again assured that
Big Mama Rag remains a very
effective tool for communication
among women. I'd be very
interested to see continued
exploration of vital issues
with the same integrity and
introspection. Write on!

In solidarity and love,
Elissa Meyer

Happy Birthday BMR

What is exciting about this birthday anniversary is that Big Mama Rag is two years old, and while the first issue came out in October of 1972, it was the culmination of nine months of planning and organization. This makes Big Mama one of the longest surviving feminist newspapers in the country - a fact supplied to us by Susan and Kirsten, the women who compiled the Women’s Survival Catalog.

Few papers have held it together that long. The fight against the male system, against weariness, has worn away many well-intentioned efforts. And, too, for many papers, discontinuing has been a positive sign. The women involved went through many changes as a result of their collective efforts, and their disbanding meant that theory had grown, that it was time to implement their learning, to refocus, to expand. Such has been the case with excellent papers such as The Furies.

Big Mama has tried to grow in another way. BMR has changed from a small operation into one reaching all across the country - from New Orleans, to L.A. and Oregon, the Midwest, and up and down the East Coast. Sales, circulation (over 3,000), and coverage cut across class, geography and personal politics. Though we are being read nationally, however, we want primarily to be a local paper for Denver women, discussing issues relevant and interesting to women here. True, the Women’s Movement needs quarterlies like Quest and Amazon Quarterly which discuss the mainstream of theory and tactics, it needs books like Amazon Odyssey which delineate capacity and function in the continuing redefinition of women.

But local networks of communication which reach out to women in a personal way, which bring about grassroots support and growth must also be part of the struggle. This is the vision involved in BMR. Women who have begun questioning the essence of their lives when they have seen articles discussed from a feminist analysis, and over the past two years this has included women in medical schools, motherhood, the unions, lesbianism and its relationship to feminism, women in prison, the working-class women.

Contrary to what some reformists believe and would like to mastermind women into thinking, BMR is THE ONLY TRULY RADICAL PAPER IN THIS CITY. It is the only paper working at changing the basic structure of this society.

It is attempting to do so by using print media in a subjective way as opposed to the traditional false notion of objectivity laid out by the straight press.

Revamping - that is what the women’s movement is all about and the objectives of BMR work towards that larger aim rather than success by its usual standards. We want the paper to be a focus for women’s energies: to inspire, to activate, be it for a women’s center, women's voice, women’s civilization. That’s what we're about and don’t miss the point. A society restructured on the more feminine principle is the vision of feminists and this paper, and when vision and word become one, that is Revolution.

Happy Birthday, Big Mama.

Black feminist, Margaret Sloan

one of two speakers, on loan to Colorado Springs

to sink or swim today

to discuss the sex role

stereotyping of women today, today being October 18th. A second thought,

another day, I might say sex role stereo- come in hi-fi. According to Sloan some

points are painful according to Hoyle others are not.

All I can say really happened that day I wrote a poem at twilight, the rest was herstory for I've never to the Springs journeyed, I say to present self to Black Feminist. Venture I to say what that pulled together one day or whom. Well, a collective of pants’ persons crossing Autumn's campus w/M.S. heaving for days. The altitude has got her by the seat of her drawers while I dream sketches in the friendly air.

Women join Margaret Sloan in Black Student Union at 3, three. Sketches: 3 Black, 7 white (if one wants to speak opposites instead of Octaves). Who creates or recreates or reaffirms the stereo sex role? Specially rolled around a big fat cullid woman who hit the road to speak for herself. Ms. Sloan is big enough to stand at the front lines and shield us all who dare not come out of our points of pain, speak about it.

As I say I felt moved to do an evening poem proceeding Sloan’s 7:30 speech in a Chaparral, Black students who conspicuously missed the Union rap came out to Chaparral, Shove Chapel full of men and ladies. They can't resist the humor and vocality of Sloan's rap! Certainly her vocality of spirit is matching her physicality, remindful of silence as the greatest point of pain.

Earlier in the day at Hotel Antlers a door slams, a woman escort from Virginia Neal Blue Center had made a hasty exit from one of the many corners the BMR right hers had cornered or circled Margaret Rose Sloan (M.R.S.) yuk, yuk, lady exits barely holding self together. Margaret says, “why didn’t I ask that woman if she has a drinking problem?” Point of pain. Silence Some do and some don’t.

M.R.S. says she gonna diet after the holidays but holidays are about a family eat-in going down. Turkey, look out!

So anyway Libby Borsch from Littleton’s Women’s Resource Center along with Ms. Sloan, we two from BMR and four other good persons from Littleton’s Women’s Resource were circled again around Margaret Sloan over some lunch at a round table trading information. I turned to Carol and suggested a picture of women at the round table sans self-consciousness, afternooning it with the Black Feminist Dynamo from New York.

All agree and are aware of the stereotypes and perhaps sitting in the direction of go, the point where pain changes to joy.

Prepared, Educated Childbirth Shows the Joy of Birth

Photo by Carol Lease

Jo and Gail Delaney and son

Carol Lease —

It isn’t impossible for a woman to go through pregnancy and
childbirth unaware of what is happening to her mind and body but
it is a difficult and unnecessary experience for her to go through.
Two people who have discovered that prepared, educated
childbirth is “fantastic” and the way to have a child are Gail and Jo
Delaney who live in Boulder with their four children and teach a
“natural” childbirth course through the Community Free School
there. A “natural” childbirth is any spontaneous, vaginal delivery

but not necessarily a prepared, educated delivery.

The common belief concerning childbirth is that
women should deliver their
babies while heavily drugged,
strapped down, and ignorant
of what their bodies are doing,
in pain, dependent on a
doctor.

“Delivering my first child
was a very unhappy, negative
experience,” says Gail. “I
didn’t know what was going
on. I was afraid which just
made me more tense which
intensified the pain and
created a horrible cycle. I
never wanted to go through
that again.”

“They wouldn’t let me see
her for 8 hours after the baby
was born,” responds Jo. “She
was in tears and felt awful.
She said ‘never again!’ I never
got any positive vibes from my
parents about birth. I knew
that there had to be a better
way to give birth.""

It was through some women
in the La Leche League, an
organization that fosters
breastfeeding, that Gail
found out about prepared
childbirth. At first she was
skeptical: “Since they had

little or no pain and since they

seemed so turned on about it,
I thought that they were the
exceptions. But I went to a
class and learned the breath-
ing and read books. And when
I had my second baby, I was
prepared for it and it was
great.”

Jo agrees. “She was bubbly
after that birth. So turned-on.
That experience was com-
pletely different - very posi-
tive.”

In 1932 an English doctor,
Grantly Dick-Reed, introduced
a method of concentrated
relaxation during labor
through his book, Childbirth
Without Fear. He believed that
most “women approached
childbirth with a great amount
of fear and that the fear
caused tension which then

caused pain. His solution was
to eliminate this fear through
education. About the same
time, Fernand La Maze, a
French doctor, believed that
women could ease labor pain
by responding to labor con-
tractions with pre-learned
controlled breathing. As con-
tractions intensified so would
the woman’s breathing and
therefore the relief of dis-
comfort.

The exercises that are
learned for prepared childbirth
help women breathe in such a
way that their bodies will
receive the oxygen necessary
to function most efficiently
while in labor. The controlled
breathing allows the muscles
of the body that are not being
used to relax and sends
energy to those muscles that
are working. Concentrating on
the proper breathing response
to muscle contractions places
a woman’s attention on doing
something, instead of always
thinking about the experiencing
pain and thereby diminishes
its effect.

The Delaneys feel that it is
not necessarily the fault of
doctors that most women
don’t have positive birth
experiences, but that rather
the fault of the medical
schools whose primary pur-
pose training in obstetrics is
for difficult births. Only about
5% of all births are difficult.
The rest are normal and don't
require the use of an
excessive amount of drugs or
forceps to facilitate delivery.

Forceps are used in delivery
to terminate prolonged labor
when the mother or the baby
is endangered. The doctor
uses the double-bladed in-
strument to pull the baby
gently out of the mother’s
body. However, too often the
forceps are abused by using
them as a matter of conveni-
ence for the doctor. Also the
use of regional block anes-

thesia has made women
unable to use muscular action
needed to deliver the baby,
thereby requiring a forceps
delivery. It is uncommon for a
prepared, unanesthetized wo-
man to need a forceps delivery.

“Doctors find it easier to
cope with an unconscious
woman,” says Gail Delaney.
“Then they can have routin-
ized births like on a conveyor
belt rather than having to deal
with each woman individually.
But women have caught on to
prepared childbirth and are
teaching the doctors now. A
woman should be determined
but use tact when looking for
a doctor to cooperate with
her in a planned childbirth.”

“The fact that an obstetri-
cian receives from $300 to
$400 for his/her services must
also be a factor that doctors
take into consideration in
seeing the woman's point of
view,” says Jo.

Doctors have convinced
American women that the only
way to have a baby is to keep
their mouths shut and to do as
they are told. But more and
more women are challenging
this by asking questions
about their bodies and by
confronting doctors. One ex-
ample is the question of
performing an episiotomy on
a laboring woman. An episi-
otomy is the making of an
incision in the area between
the vagina and the anus to
enlarge the opening through
which the baby will pass. This
procedure is routinely done in
the United States usually
because the woman is anes-
thetized and cannot feel when
to stop pushing and because
doctors are too hurried to
massage the vaginal opening
which could then stretch to
very wide proportions without
tearing and allow the birth.

Episiotomies are some-
times done so that a woman’s
vagina and pelvic floor mus-
cles will not stretch too much.
Doctors claim that this can
cause problems later, such as
uterine prolapse, which is
when a woman’s reproductive
organs begin to slip down
through the pelvic floor. This
occurs in women who have
had many deliveries and can
be avoided by exercise. The
real reason that doctors
perform unnecessary episi-
otomies seems to be that a
looser vagina will interfere
with a man’s sexual pleasure
during intercourse.

Another common practice
during delivery is to have the
woman lying on her back
which causes the uterus to
press on a major blood vessel
which is involved in supplying
blood to the uterus. This
makes it harder for the woman
to breathe, inhibits her blood
circulation and may harm the
baby.

“Home delivery is great. But
a woman should have a doctor
or somebody to help. (In
Colorado a midwife must have
a medical degree.) It’s a
personal decision,” says Gail.
“It’s not like in Europe where
there are traveling emergency
units available to midwives
who deliver over half of all
babies at home. Special
cases, such as when multiple
births are predicted or when
the woman has had difficult
deliveries are delivered in a
hospital with an attending
doctor.”

In this country there is no
such system for home deliv-
eries. Midwives are illegal in
most states. Women are
forced to go to strange,
uncaring, non-supportive
hospitals and incur tremen-
dous expense and suffer
needlessly to perform a
completely natural act. Wo-
men who deliver babies are
treated like children and as if
they were sick.

“Prepared childbirth makes
a woman aware of what is
happening to her during labor.
She will probably have fewer
problems because her body
won’t be tense due to the
breathing exercises and the
fact that she will be concen-
trating on them and not the
contractions. She'll be more
able to cope with anything
that might happen and make
intelligent decisions,” says
Gail.

“It’s ideal to have her partner
there, but not necessary,” she
continues. “But you need to
have someone there to help.
Someone who is supportive
and knows what is going on
too.” Although not all hospi-
tals allow someone in the
delivery room, some do. And
those that don’t will have to be
changed. Jo Delaney feels
that being present at the birth
of a child allows a man “to
enjoy a pretty mysterious,
unknown part of life. For a
husband and wife to be
together at the time of birth is
a superb hype to a relationship.
We love teaching these
classes and encourage wo-
men who are expecting a child
to try prepared childbirth.”

INEZ GARCIA: SHE KILLED HER RAPIST AND WAS CONVICTED
Guest writer this month: Sandia

This edition of BMR is focusing on women and health.
Understandably most of the articles concern issues related to the
particular physical and mental information that women need to
know about their bodies and the facilities available to them in our
area. But to assume that the question of health must be relegated
to such a narrow focus would be erroneous. When the society we
live in is sick, and when that society dictates the terms of right
and wrong (social health) then our own personal well-being is
jeopardized.

Too often the system is attacked in general terms and the
exact nature of its pathology undefined. However, there is a
specific example of the sickness of this society that may well turn
your stomach as it did mine. That it may turn your politics and
attitudes as well is the point of this article.

Inez Garcia, a 30-year-old woman from California, was
recently raped. Her reaction to that crime against her person and
dignity as a human being aroused in her a response that any
woman under the same circumstances would find justifiable: she
killed him. Inez has been convicted of second degree murder.

Immediately what floods into our brain is how is that
possible? Women treated as property by this society and defined
that way by the terms of marriage, name, money - are not allowed
to defend their ultimate property, themselves. You ask, what are
the mitigating circumstances?

Inez did not kill him immediately after the rape, in the heat
of passion would be the legal phrase. As if passion and the
intensity of our fear and anger diminishes over time. Inez had not
reported the rape to the police at first as so many women do not
because of the ensuing shame that follows--one would not be
ashamed to be robbed or beaten, but it is interesting that when the
essence of women is violated, a woman is made to feel indecent.

Thus there was no “proof” of rape as determined by our
society, and need we add that that determination has been made
by lawyers and judges who have been mostly men. Requiring the
presence of semen as one of the few accepted criteria for rape
conviction is like asking for Hiroshima to show only its outward
destruction and not the scars that its people felt for years
afterwards in their hearts and feelings.

During the trial, the issue of rape was not allowed as
evidence because rape had not been proven; yet the rape was the
provocation. More than that it brings up the question of
self-defense. A male juror reflects the ultimate crime behind the
system’s attitudes and actions. First he noted that self-defense
wasn’t a viable position because “he’s not trying to kill her. He’s
just trying to screw her and give her a good time.” If this remark is
sick another comment is proof of the insanity of the situation:
“When I leave here I'll have less fear of raping a woman now than
I did before. At least I know if I get shot she wouldn't get away.”
When asked if he really meant that he replied, “I wasn't joking...I
was thinking of all the men out there reading it. I told them that.”

It is the implications of this man’s statements and the court
decision that should make every woman’s blood curdle. If this
case becomes precedent, then male acceptance of rape and the
sickness it represents will become the basis for law. More, it will
become license.

The complete vindication of Inez Garcia is necessary to the
restoration of health in this society. It is not her problem alone; it
is a battleground for all women, an Armageddon where the values
of each of us as free persons are at stake. Admittedly the prognosis is
poor, but the soundness and health of the social body is the
concern of all of us.

A defense committee for Inez has been set up. Send her
your money if you can, your psychic strength if you cannot:

The Denver Women’s Re-
source Center is sponsoring a
series of free, lunchtime
mini-workshops and evening
legal seminars for women
during November and Decem-
ber.

Workshops will be held
from 11 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. on
Wednesdays and will include
group discussions, speakers
and films. On November 13,
“Uterine & Breast Cancer” will
be the topic with the Denver
Unit of American Cancer
Society co-sponsoring the
discussion. As part of the
workshop, participants will
have the opportunity to make
a doctor's appointment for a
free pap test. Another work-
shop of note will include a
slide presentation designed to
show how children’s books
are still stereotyped and to
explain the need for supple-
menting a child’s reading with
non-sexist literature. The pre-
sentation, “Sex-Role Stereo-
typing in Children’s Books”
will be followed by a
discussion led by members of
the American Association of
University Women of Boulder.
In addition, a book display will
be set up offering alternative
suggestions for children's

reading materials.

On November 19 through
22, the Resource Center will
offer “On Job Direction,” a
four-day employment work-
shop that focuses on improv-
ing job-hunting skills and
techniques. It offers each
woman a chance to assess her
personal goals, strengths and
weaknesses through individu-
al and group counseling and
gives her practical experience
in writing a resume and
interviewing. Free child care
will be available.

A legal seminar, to be held
on November 12, will feature a
panel of lawyers who will
discuss “Finding a Good
Lawyer.” The panel will cover
such questions as whether
you need an attorney for your
grievance, how to choose a
good lawyer and what essen-
tial questions to ask your
lawyer. Other topics to be
discussed are qualifying for
free legal services and filing
grievances. Free child care is

also available for these
seminars. ©

Inexpensive Contraceptives
Women's Resource Center Available for Women, Men

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Although numerous folks in
Colorado will at some time in
their reproductive years use
the services of a family
planning agency, most of
them are not aware of just
how extensive those services
are. In our state, there are three
primary sources of family
planning assistance: Denver
Health & Hospitals, the State
Department of Health and
Rocky Mountain Planned Par-
enthood (RMPP).

The most well-known serv-
ice of Planned Parenthood is
that of providing contracept-
ives. A woman, teen or adult,
may obtain the contraceptive
of her choice by making an
appointment at a Planned Par-
enthood clinic. There, the
doctor will examine her and
give her a Pap smear before
prescribing the method of
birth control she has chosen.
After the initial exam, she is
expected to return once a year
for a Pap smear and breast
examination. The fee for these
services is charged according
to the income of the woman

and/or her family. In other
words, each woman is asked
to pay as much as she can
afford. For a patient unable to
pay any fee, some limited
funds are available to cover
her services until she has an
adequate income.

If a woman thinks she may
be pregnant and is not sure
what to do about it, RMPP
offers both pregnancy testing
(by urine test and pelvic
examination) and problem
pregnancy counseling. Both
require appointments and
modest fees. If she seriously
decides to discontinue her
pregnancy, a woman can be
referred to a private doctor, a
public hospital or the Planned
Parenthood Central Denver
clinic for an abortion.

Other services

A contraceptive patient at
almost any RMPP clinic can
usually obtain other services
there as well. These include
testing and treatment for
venereal disease and vaginal
infections. She can also receive
a breast exam and learn how
to do her own self-exam at
home. If she is contemplating

a tubal ligation (female
sterilization), the Planned
Parenthood staff can provide
counseling and referral to a
doctor for such a procedure.

What about the man who
decides to take some respon-
sibility in the area of
controlling reproduction? Of
course, condoms are available
at all RMPP clinics. But for
the man who has determined
that he no longer wants the
potential to reproduce at all,
Planned Parenthood offers
vasectomy counseling, as
well as referral either to a
private urologist or to the
RMPP Central Denver vasect-
omy clinic.

So, it would seem that
Rocky Mountain Planned Par-
enthood provides services
primarily to individuals and
families. However, the ag-
ency also reaches out to the
community with more gener-
alized programs. One of the
fastest-growing segments of
RMPP is the training depart-
ment. Working out of the

Feminist Health Service ~
in Colorado Springs

The Women’s Health Serv-
ice of Colorado Springs
(WHSCS) started about two
and a half years ago with its
original purpose being to
provide educational oppor-
tunities and material to
women about their bodies
through self-health classes or
“clinics.”

The women spoke with
many other women and
doctors all over the state, put
out literature about health
care and prevention and some
members went to the Feminist
Clinic in Los Angeles to see
how that clinic operated. The
health service provides self-
health clinics in informal
gatherings and for large,
formal presentations.

According to a pamphlet of
the service, “self-health
revolves around the ‘well
woman’ concept, teaching
body awareness through
reading, audio-visual aids,
discussion and gynecological
self-examination. By practic-
ing preventive medicine, wo-
men neither diagnose nor
prescribe, but gain knowledge
and confidence about their
bodies and reduce their
ignorance and fears about
common concerns such as
burning, itching, discharges,
late periods, breast or cervical
cancer, birth control, preg-
nancy and menopause. At the
first unusual sign, women can
seek professional help and take
whatever action necessary
before a problem becomes
uncomfortable or even fatal.”

Since the health service
began receiving frequent in-
quiries about the local doctors
and the quality of medical
care, it has interviewed local
gynecologists and other doc-
tors. “We found that there are
no women gynecologists in
Colorado Springs,” says Su-
san Keating, a founder of the
group. “Some doctors would
not cooperate at all, but we
managed to compile a direc-
tory of services, fees and
attitudes of some of the
doctors here.”

The health service also

wanted to go into examination
rooms, with the permission of
the patient, and see just how
women were treated. Again,
many doctors were very
threatened by this. But there
were those doctors who were
open and were very co-opera-
tive and helpful. The service
wanted to provide advocacy
for women who were often
misinformed, confused, or
unaware of their rights as
patients.

Continues Susan, “When I
went to the Feminist Clinic in
Los Angeles, the doctor there
was very open and explained
everything. I’m sure they have
things to improve on (at the
clinic) but it's the best health
care I’ve seen for women.”

The Women’s Health Serv-
ice found out that women who
were in a pregnancy dilemma
had no place to go to receive
any counseling. Now counseling
is provided through the
health service. No particular
solution to the problem of an
unwanted pregnancy is
pushed at the counseling
service. A woman is provided
with an explanation of her
alternatives in a supportive,
non-judgmental atmosphere.

If a woman chooses to
terminate her pregnancy, she
soon discovers that in Colora-
do Springs no office proce-
dures are available because all
the doctors who will perform
abortions will do so only in
hospitals. Thus the financial
relationship between the hos-
pital and the doctor is
strengthened, at the expense
of a woman who does not
have the money to pay for a
hospital stay.

However, even women who
can pay the cost do not
receive good adequate medi-
cal care. Some doctors use
unnecessary anesthesia and
large equipment that just
increases a woman's trauma.
So many Colorado Springs
women go outside their
community to have abortions.
The health service provides an
advocacy/companionship
service to any woman who

Carol Lease

wants to go to Denver to have
an abortion. All the details
can be handled through the
service.

The Department of Public
Health, Planned Parenthood,
Colorado General Hospital
and crisis lines are a few of
the agencies that recognize,
emotionally support, and
refer women to the service.

However, since women are
at the bottom of the financial
ladder in this country and
have little money of their own,
the groups that they create
and maintain often suffer
financial insecurity. The
WHSCS is no exception. The
service is financially support-
ed solely by its unsalaried
organizers and donations. The
group has sought and is
seeking funding to keep its
services available for women.
Future plans include the
establishment of a free
pre-natal clinic, a full-fledged
women’s clinic, having some
members trained as nurse-
clinicians and publishing the
second edition of the service's
handbook Circle One.

The handbook was to be
available this fall, but printing
problems have delayed its
entry into the world of
feminist health care. The
group hopes that the printer
will resolve their problems
(financial ones, we're told)
because “back orders are
piling up!”

Circle One was published to
help consolidate all the
material the service had been
printing. It was the first
self-health handbook and is
used all over the country.

WOMEN & FINANCE

a column

Kathleen Richardson

Income protection to me is one of the most important
assets that any individual, married or single, can have. Only eight
out of a hundred people in the United States are financially
secure—that leaves the rest of us only a couple of paychecks away
from financial disaster.

Almost everyone has hospitalization protection through
their employer or on an individual basis. This helps with the
medical bills while in the hospital. What is there to take care of
other bills when you are out and cannot go back to work for a
couple of months? The rent, mortgage, taxes, time payments, and
groceries still continue.

Some people have savings accounts, but how long will that
last? Others could count on their borrowing power—but consider
who would loan money to someone disabled, and how would you
pay it back? Still others have affluent parents they can rely on...
most of us do not.

The whole concept of income protection is just what it
says—to protect your income in case something should happen to
your earning power. Stop and think for a moment, if you were to
be in one of the accidents Sky Spy reports every morning and
could not work for several months, what money would there be for
you to continue paying the bills?

Most income protection plans will cover 50% of your
income; some go as high as 66%. All the benefits received will be
tax-free to you.

There are several things to look for when considering an
income protection policy. The first one is to make sure that it is a
noncancellable and a guaranteed renewable. This will keep an
insurance company from refusing to renew your policy for any
reason and from raising your premiums. The non-cancellable
provision keeps them from cancelling you if they feel you have
become too costly. A retroactive waiver of premium will refund the premiums
that have been paid during a period of disability and will continue
to pay the premium for you until you are able to do so yourself.

A rehabilitation benefit provision can be a benefit if, after a
disability, you cannot resume your previous employment. This
benefit usually runs approximately six months and will help with
the cost of educating and training you for other employment.
Another provision to look for is house confinement. Some policies
state that you have to be confined in a hospital, a convalescent
facility, or a home. Look for one that does not require this
confinement. This is a situation that should be left up to you and
your doctor.

The waiting periods that you select for your income
protection policy is an individual consideration. The longer the
waiting periods, the more drastically the cost drops. No waiting
period versus a waiting period of six months can make a
significant difference in the premium rates. However, how long a
time you can remain financially independent while not working
should be your primary consideration. If you are living from pay
check to pay check, I would recommend a shorter waiting period
than if you have five months' salary tucked away in the bank. The
waiting period itself is divided into two types. One for sickness

and one for accident. Most people prefer a first-day accident
coverage with the seven to fourteen-day sickness waiting period.
The reasoning on the longer waiting period for sickness is that
most of us are sick for only a few days at a time and this is usually
covered by sick leave accumulated at work. But accidents can
cause an extended time away from our jobs and should be covered
immediately.

There are several optional benefits for a relatively low cost.
The first one is Guarantee of Future Insurability... this rider
guarantees a right at periodic times in the future to increase
monthly benefits without medical evidence of insurability. A
partial accident and sickness rider pays 50% of the monthly
benefit allowing a period of total disability when you can perform
only some of the regular duties of your occupation. A partial
accident rider covers accidents only; an accident death and
dismemberment rider provides, in addition to your monthly
benefit, a lump sum payment to your beneficiary in the event of any
accidental death, or a percentage of this amount for the loss of
body members. Finally, another common optional benefit is a
convalescent benefit. This pays for a percentage of a convalescent
facility should you require additional care but not enough to
warrant staying in the hospital.

There are standard exceptions to coverage, including war
and military service, self-inflicted injuries, special exclusions as
outlined by the policy.

What each individual must consider is the losses they
would suffer if they physically could not work for an extended
period of time. Savings last only so long; creditors want to see
payments being made on any loans made to you, and accepting
charity is undesirable for most people. Perhaps you cannot
escape disability, but you can avoid the effects of it.

Squatter’s Rights

Pay to Pee?

The Women’s Coalition to
End Pay Toilets (WCEPT) has
begun its attack on the city of
Denver with a demonstration
protesting the discrimination
women face at public facilities.
A stand-in action was held
at Stapleton Airport in Octob-
er.

The coalition recently con-
ducted a survey which shows
that the airport contains 84
pay facilities for women and
only 36 for men. There are 70
free urinals for men and only
16 for women.

According to Linda Meyer, a
spokesperson for the Coalition, 
this means that women
are charged almost four times
as often as men for the use of
toilet facilities.

The coalition has asked the
city to reconsider its contract
with Pacific Nik-o-Lok, but so
far nothing has happened.
“We tried to talk to Mayor
McNichols, but he never
called us back,” says Maryann
Tavery, another coalition
member. Tavery talked to her
councilman who subsequently
offered to set up a meeting
of the Stapleton Committee,
the part of the City Council
that deals with the airport,
with the WCEPT to discuss
the issue. So far, nothing has
come of that either.

The city grosses about
$60,000 a year from the pay
facilities, 90% of which goes
to the city, the rest to the
owning company.

The coalition feels that this
unequal economic burden
placed on women violates the

Public Accommodations Law
which prohibits unequal en-
joyment of services and
facilities in a place of public
accommodations because of
sex. The coalition also be-
lieves that the unfair practice
violates the Colorado Equal
Rights Amendment. Finally,
the Women’s Coalition to End
Pay Toilets feels the contract
isn’t keeping with the spirit of
City Ordinance 555 which
calls for non-discrimination in
city contracts.

The coalition questions the
existence of pay toilets for
anyone. According to their
position paper, the first pay
toilets locks in the United
States were installed in
railroad stations in 1910 when
indoor plumbing was rare.
This supposedly discouraged
non-passengers from using
the indoor facilities. Passengers
had the doors unlocked
for their use.

The coalition plans to bring
the issue into the courts in
civil suits. Because the
validity of class action suits is
being questioned, 75 ag-
grieved parties have signed
notarized complaints alleging
discrimination. If the case is
settled in favor of the
complainants, they are all
entitled to monetary com-
pensation under the provisions of
the Public Accommodations
Law. Other cities, counties,
and states such as Chicago,
Florida, Nevada, and Las
Vegas have seen the discrim-
inatory effects of pay toilet
facilities on women and have
eliminated them. The coali-

Action Taken
Against
Dalkon IUD

Controversy over the poten-
tial dangers of the Dalkon
Shield IUD has moved to the
courts.

A.H. Robins Company,
manufacturers of the device,
have become the target of
what may be the first class
action suit by a doctor against
a pharmaceutical firm.

The action came when a
Wichita, Kansas woman be-
came pregnant shortly after
she’d had the Dalkon Shield
inserted. The woman filed a
malpractice suit asking
$40,000 in damages from her
obstetrician and $250,000
from A.H. Robins.

Her doctor then filed a
cross claim against A.H.
Robins asking $300,000 in
actual damages and $2 million
in punitive damages on behalf
of other doctors who may face
malpractice suits from pa-
tients for whom they’ve
prescribed the device.

His suit charges that the
company promotes the Dal-
kon Shield without adequate
testing and “without warning
the medical profession of all
the risks associated with the
use (of the shield) such as
partial perforation or embed-
ment of the uterus upon
insertion and post-insertion
migration.”"

Johnston  
at CU  

Chocolate Waters  

It seems to me that every  

dyke in America has written  
love letters to Jill Johnston at  
one time or another. I first  
started dashing off notes to  
this woman who has become  
one of the most well-known  
radical Lesbian writers in the  
country, when I was a senior  
in college. It was a time when  
nobody would dare whisper  
the word “Lesbian” let alone  
write about actually being  
one.  
Having been a closet dyke  
for years, I first stumbled  
across Jill in the Village Voice  
when she was coming out  
with “Lois Lane is A Lesbian”  
and other related articles.  
From then on I read her  
column avidly and even  
though I thought she was  
terribly obscure sometimes, I  
knew Lesbians were in there  
somewhere and I was desper-  
ate for information.  

At that time around 1970  
Johnston had not yet been  
politicized; she hadn't started  
relating Lesbianism to Fem-  
inism and was still what she  
termed “your average Ameri-  
can individualist.” A misfit of  
sorts, she never really fit into  
the Gay Liberation Movement  
and she’s still not quite  
comfortable with the Wo-  
men’s Movement-- where she  
has at times been viciously  
attacked. Although Johnston  
has a perceptive grasp of  
radical feminist principles,  
many women have found her  
snowflake patterns of writing  
too dispersed for ready  
understanding. Other women,  
however, carry around her  
second book, Lesbian Nation  
--The Feminist Solution, in-  
side their hearts like a modern  
manifesto of radical femin-  
ism.  

Livening up Boulder  

On the evening of Oct. 9,  
Jill Johnston sauntered into  
the Alumnae Hall at the  
University of Colorado in  
Boulder with an “entourage”  
which consisted of her 14-  
year-old daughter, Winnie and  
her 17-year-old son, Richard  
and a few friends. Flopping  
down in a comfortable chair,  
she crossed her legs, held on  
to her coffee cup for security,  
and asked us what we wanted  
to talk about. The audience,  
which consisted primarily of  
women sprawled in all direc-  
tions across the floor, seemed  
to be taken aback.  

Perhaps they weren’t aware  
of the intense criticism Jill  
has received about being a  
Women’s Movement “Star.”  
(i.e. a creation of the media  
who is expected to monopo-  
lize and overpower a situation  
with one’s very presence).  
Nevertheless, it was obvious  
at the outset that she was  
struggling with that dilemma.  
Both of her “speaking en-  
gagements” at CU took on the  
form of informal rap sessions  

with women interacting with  

Jill as well as with each other.  

Unfortunately for some, and  
fortunately for others, Jill  
Johnston speaks the way she  
writes--a sunburst of anec-  
dotes, personal perceptions,  
historical facts, and radical  
ideologies. Her mind kaleido-  
scopes in such a way and on  
so many different levels  
simultaneously that many  
women went away feeling as  
though they'd somehow  
missed the point. “Where was  
the logic?” they wondered. “I  
didn't think she made any  
sense at all!"" exclaimed  
others in exasperation.  

One of the primary reasons  

for confusion probably cen-  
tered around the clashing of  

basic radical feminist ideolo-  
gies with more conservative  

questions of equal rights.  

That many did not seem to  

understand that such differ-  
ences even existed only added  
to the confusion.  

Opinions crossed class and  
sexual orientation lines, but  
basically the argument fell  
into two camps. On the one  
hand were the equal rights  
women who believed that  
legislative reform would cor-  
rect the oppression of women.  
They wanted to petition  
senators and legislators and  
work for reforms within the  
laws.  

On the other side of the  
coin were the more radical  
women who asserted that  
winning so-called equality in a  
world controlled by men and  
men’s values should not be a  
major goal of Women’s  
Movement. These women  
maintained that the entire  
male system must be subvert-  
ed by creating women’s own  

institutions which would work  

for women and promote  
women-identified values at  
the same time.  

Coin Goes Back and Forth  

The coin, which was tossed  
back and forth sporadically,  
displayed both sides of the  
sexual orientation issue as it  
pertained to legislative re-  
forms and radical feminist  
underminings. Said a Boulder  
woman, “I wish all the gay  
senators and lawmakers  
would come out... it’s the  
people in the government with  
power and money who legis-  
late our existence. Change  
never occurs from the bottom  
up. It always happens from  
the top down.”  

Many women heatedly dis-  
agreed. “It’s exactly the  
opposite,” exclaimed a woman  
from Denver. “When you ask  
the system to give you validity  
by making you legal, then  
you're giving validity to that  
system which oppresses us.”  

Another Denverite argued  
vehemently that she didn't  
want a piece of the pie: “I don't  
want to be equal with what it  
is men are in this system and I  
don’t need male legislators to  

tell me whether I have the  
right to exist!”  
Jill Johnston, who sees  

espousal of radical feminist  
views as probably a major  
reason why she wasn’t under-  
stood very well in Boulder,  
offered her own view. “When  
the point remains at a sexual  
preference level then how are  
you going to educate people  
that Lesbianism means  
something much more than  
just who you sleep with. (i.e. a  
whole way of life, a way of  
undermining the patriarchy  
and creating your own situa-  
tions). “As women's con-  
sciousness gradually chang-  
es,” she continued, “women  
are finding it impossible to  
work in any kind of hierarchal  
structures. What's happening  
all over the country right now  
is that women are gradually  
withdrawing from these insti-  
tutions and creating their  
own. The question is how to  
do this effectively.”  

Many Unconvinced  

Many women, however,  
refused to be convinced and a  
staunch supporter of legisla-  
tive reform cited the abortion  
issue as an example of how  
the law can change things  
effectively.  

“But,” quipped Jill, “when  
women get their conscious-  
ness raised then they won't  
need abortions anymore.”  

Nevertheless, the argument  
seemed to be at a standstill  
and the rest of the evening  
was devoted to other topics  
such as psychic feminism,  
violence in relation to the  
movement, and the tensions  
(or lack of them) between  
heterosexual feminists and  
Lesbian Feminists.  

One woman wanted to know  
what Jill thought radical  
feminists were really into  
these days. She threw up her  
hands, almost cackled and  
exclaimed with a bit of exas-  
peration, “Romance, witch-  
craft and astrology.” She also  
felt that a lot of women were  
dealing with the question of  
“mahogany.” A man in the  
audience didn’t get the pun on  
monogamy. “Mahogany,” she  
explained patiently, “is a form  
of relating to just one other  
person-- you know, as op-  
posed to cedar or pine.”  

Although the discussion  
was still going strong at  
11:30--the building was about  
to be shut down on us and the  
crowd dispersed somewhat  
reluctantly. Nevertheless,  
many of the same women  
came to Jill's informal talk at  
the student union the next  
day. The setting was some-  
what more formal with Jill on  
stage this time, but the  
proceedings were basically  
the same.  

As she was reading from a  
new piece concerning  
“smother-daughter"" relation-  
ships, I was thinking more  
about what a nice person she  
really was than about what  
she was reading. Jill Johnston  
was infamous for being outra-  
geous--for throwing chairs  
and plates of fruit, for  
swimming half-nude at an  
elegant fund-raising benefit,  
for blatantly asking Gloria  
Steinem to dance etc. These  
antics surrounded Jill like an  
aura, but in person she was  
very serious, usually witty,  
and sometimes even shy. She  
even dealt with the men in the  
audience in a nice way when  
they prated on about whatever  
it was they were prating on  
about. Mostly, however, I was  
impressed with how genuinely  
she responded to other  
women and how very real she  
was in person.  

Her latest book, Gullible’s  
Travels is now available at  
local bookstores."

again girls. An-n-nd one. . .”  

On the window sill busts of composers

the room—a visual maze of wooden  
puppets and Wedgwood, portraits of

chairs.  

“Good, good. Now do you remember  
what you're to practice for next week?”  

Antonia Brico finishes a piano lesson.  

She puts her arm around each of the  
sisters, “These are T.P.'s,” she announces.  
The girls look up, shy and puzzled.  
“Teacher's pets,” she explains, then  
laughs and hugs them both.  

The first time I saw Antonia Brico  
conduct, high on her podium dressed in  
black, she was huge and regal. As the  
audience quieted and she signaled the  
orchestra with her baton, her upraised  
arms seemed to encircle the entire stage.  

Today, leaning on the piano counting  
time, with one eye on her student's hands  
and the other on the score, I find she’s a  
small woman. In her home, her studio,  
she’s not single-mindedly serious as when  
performing, but remains in benevolent  
command (of all but Carmen the cat who  
curls up where she will.)  

Always ready to tease; always ready to  
laugh, Antonia Brico is guileless and alive  
with unaffected enthusiasm. And her  
enthusiasm brims on one subject in  
particular: Antonia: A Portrait of a  
Woman, the new film chronicling her life  
and struggle as a woman conductor.  

Assembled by her former student, now  
folksinger, Judy Collins, and film editor  
Jill Godmilow, the documentary has  
received adulation from publications as  
diverse as the Village Voice and Time  
Magazine. Few have denied that the  
research, interviewing, filming and editing  
are sound and cohesive; that the movie  
is art. But none have denied that its subject,  
Antonia Brico, is a woman of talent and  
strength.  

Though she studied piano from the age  
of five and finally received a degree from  
the Master School of Conducting at the  
Berlin State Academy, her career as a  
conductor has been sporadic because, as  
the film reveals, she is a woman.  

In 1930, at the age of 28, Dr. Brico  
became the first woman to conduct the  
Berlin Philharmonic. She went on to  
conduct at the Hollywood Bowl, the  
Metropolitan Opera House in New York,  
even Carnegie Hall. She was well-received  
by all but boards of directors and  
managers of symphony orchestras. None  
would hire a female conductor. “We  
cannot sell a woman conductor,” they  
insisted.  

The hot/cold reactions to her conducting,  
or at least her saleability, were often  
emotionally draining. During a quiet,  
late-night sequence in the film, Dr.  
Brico’s eyes grow distant as she tells of  
crying all night following a successful  
performance in New York, not knowing  
when or if she would get another chance.  

But she also rages at the unfairness.  
“The orchestra is my instrument. How  
would you like to be able to play your  
instrument only five to six times a year  
when you're able to play five or six times  
a month?” she demanded of Collins in  
the film.  

In defiance of her discrimination, Dr.  
Brico began an all-woman orchestra in  
New York in the 1930s. And for a time,  
it generated a lot of publicity, good and  
bad, and filled auditoriums. But as the  
novelty wore off, crowds thinned and the  
orchestra was forced to disband.  

Elusive though they were, the periodic  
engagements as guest conductor for  
orchestras throughout the United States  
and abroad encouraged Dr. Brico to  
continue her struggle. Newspaper clip-  
pings in her carefully kept scrapbooks  
testify to the fact that whenever she did  
conduct, she was a success.  

Her travels, involvement in music and  
engaging personality led her into close  
friendships with many well-known artists  
and intellectuals. In the documentary she  

Story by Nancy Heine  

recalls times spent with Bruno Walter,  
Jean Sibelius, Arthur Rubinstein and  
Igor Stravinsky. But Antonia Brico’s face  
becomes alternately excited and melan-  
choly when she remembers Albert  
Schweitzer, whose large color photograph  
hangs prominently above the stairway in  
her home.  

I noticed a smaller framed photo of  
Schweitzer signed “Antonia, mit liebe,  
Albert” as I settled into a chair waiting  
for Dr. Brico to see her students out the  
door. Evidence of her own affection—for  
her students—lay on the coffee table in  

Photos by Glenna Booth  

front of me: a basket of suckers, neatly  
lined with a paper napkin, wood puzzles  
and magazines to keep impatient little  
pianists quietly entertained.  

When the students had gone, and  
Carmen, lying languidly across the top of  
the piano, had been indulged with a bit  
of petting, Dr. Brico sat down across  
from me. “Did you see the movie?” she  
asked.  

I said I had and told her I was as  
impressed as everyone else seemed to be.  
“But how do you feel about it?”  

“I thought it was marvelous how they  
put that together,” she said. “And  
marvelous how they unearthed that  

Fox Movietone (old film clip which opens  
the documentary) of me.  

""That was the Metropolitan Opera  
House stage. It was 1933. And it was  
such an event to have a woman conduct  
that the Fox Movietone made a newsreel  
out of it. I saw it in a theatre but didn’t  
know what happened to it. They found it  
in Los Angeles.”  
“Since it was such a personal film,  
didn’t you...”  
“I know it. I know it,” Dr. Brico  
interrupted, excited, “and that’s the  
thing that seems to have gotten people.  
And I think it’s because I wasn’t aware of  
it; I wasn’t aware that I was in the movies  
or that I was being taped.  

“I was just with a good friend. And  
then, she was clever enough to ask  
provocative questions that got me upset  
and wild. I would not have talked like  
that if I had really been aware it was for  
publication.  

“I don’t think I ever thought the movie  
was going to be such a big thing. I  
thought it was a personal affair between  
Judy and myself.”  

“When we made Time Magazine, I  
thought that was unbelievable,” she said  
shaking her head and obviously pleased.  

I asked naively how Time could ignore  
the film when every major paper in cities  
it had played had praised it.  

“How could they ignore it!” she shot  
back incredulously, “I've been ignored a  
great deal, my dear.” Then raising her  
eyebrows and nodding she said again,  
“I’ve been ignored.”  

“What about the male musicians?” I  
asked. “Did they ever resent being  
conducted by a woman?""  

“No, never,” Dr. Brico protested,  
“They're musicians. They only want to  
know if the person up there knows  
anything about music. That's all they  
care about. I’ve never had any problems  
with musicians, and I've conducted in  
many capitals abroad.”  

For the past 27 years, Dr. Brico has  
conducted her own non-profit, semi-  
professional orchestra in Denver which  
performs four or five times a year. How  
was it, I asked, that she had finally  
settled in Denver.  

In 1940, she explained, she shared a  
manager with George Enescu, a well-  
known composer/conductor/pianist.  
When Hitler closed the Romanian  
borders, Enescu, a Romanian, was unable  

to fulfill his worldwide engagements. His  
manager tried to distribute the concerts  
to his other artists.  

In December, 1940, Dr. Brico conducted  
in Enescu’s place in Denver. “They were  
skeptical,” she said, “but they liked me  
enough to engage me for the next year for  
two concerts.  

At this time the Denver Businessmen’s  
Orchestra was forming as an alternative  
to the Denver Symphony Orchestra.  
Leon Minear conducted the new  
orchestra for a year, then found himself  
too busy with other projects to continue.  
He suggested Dr. Brico be named as a  
replacement. After conducting the group  
20 years, Dr. Brico was honored by  
having the orchestra named after her.  

Today, at the age of 73, Dr. Brico’s  
time is divided between rehearsing the  
orchestra, giving piano lessons in her  
home and occasionally guest conducting.  
(On Sunday afternoon, November 10, she  
will conduct the Denver Symphony in a  
free concert at the Auditorium Theatre at  
3 p.m.)  

The film, Antonia, has re-established her  
fame and generated fan mail from old  
students and new admirers throughout  
the world. The Brico Symphony coffers  
swell with profits from a recent benefit  
showing.  
The most important effect of the film,  
however, has yet to be realized. That is,  
whether it has an impact on sexist  
attitudes toward conducting.  

“Do you think it’s easier for women to  
conduct now?"" I asked.  

""Well, yes,"" Dr. Brico replied thoughtfully.  
“There are some, a handful, of  
women being trained as conductors now  
and I'm sure they'll have an easier road.  
We'll see if this film brings others more  
opportunities than I've had.”"

We are hanging on for dear life to the tail of a rampaging
tiger. And right now I wouldn’t be into taking any bets on the out
come.

Big Mama has grown faster than we, the staff, and our
resources have. She has become Denver's feminist communica-
tion institution and one of the major feminist publications in this
country. The amount of work coming into this office increases
every day. More letters, paperwork, phone calls - half the time you
can’t work for answering the phone. (This is one of the few places
Denver women can get information and help they need; would
someone please organize a feminist switchboard?)

The women’s movement in Denver is mushrooming.
Keeping up with happenings that need to be covered is
impossible. Writers! We need writers! If you can write, or think
maybe you can write, or want to learn and can do something on
assignment - cover a story, work on researching and writing a
feature - call us and do it.

Maybe you don’t want to write, or don’t have time to write,
or don’t want to be a big part of BMR, but you still care about the
paper. Well, if you don’t mind shit work, there is plenty. Come in
for an hour and file - the backlog will amaze you. Take a mailing to
the post office. Do a little typing. Stay at home and clip articles
from newspapers for our resource library. Help put up posters.
Ask a store you know to sell the paper.

Money! Oh woe! Our money situation is so questionable
that we don’t often know for sure if the next issue will come out.
We need $1,000 a month to publish this paper. And rest assured
no one is getting rich on it. The two paid coordinators get $125
per month each. That's less than $1 per hour for a forty hour week,
a luxury we rarely get. It’s impossible to make it on that kind of
pay without a little help from your friends. Big Mama needs about
five full-time paid staffers to do the job right, PLUS lots of
contributors. To everyone who has ever said Big Mama is a good
newspaper and you're glad she’s here, we are saying please, put
your money where your mouth is. If every woman who reads this
paper gave $1 a month we would not have money problems. For
that $1 a month you can give something to an awful lot of sisters.
Make a pledge. Do it!

When you’re moving as fast as you can go, and there is
always more work to do, and you get more behind, and you
wonder who cares you can start to get depressed. That's bad for
the soul and it doesn’t do Mama any good either.

Lady, your Mama’s here, and she loves you. And she
needs you. Take care of her. Won’t you?

Sexuality

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 5

Workshops:

From Guilt to Responsibility

Carol Lease

Sexuality is a part of
women's lives that has been
denied and repressed to serve
the needs of the dominant
economic, cultural and social
system. The sexual revolution
has been a fraud, especially to
women, but the experience of
women has raised serious
questions and exposed needs
and women are now doing
something about it. One place
in Denver that a woman can
deal with her sexuality is at a
Human Sexuality workshop
conducted by Jean Fortier, a
member of the staff of the
Gestalt Institute in Denver.

“A lot of what happens to
women is that we grow up like
child-women and not like
adults,” Fortier says. “Women
must realize that they don’t
need permission to be angry
and that they don’t have to
spend the rest of their lives
hating men.

“Women are sexual beings.
We have to realize that it is
alright to say no, to have
orgasms, to know about our
bodies.”

Fortier feels that many
women, whether homosexual
or heterosexual, are centered
around making the other
person feel good instead of
making joy for the self. “It
may be that women don’t feel
worth, and hence won’t allow
themselves pleasure.” It isn’t
hard to understand this since
women grow up with such an
enormous amount of myths,
some of which deal with
menstruation, beauty, the “joy
of martyrdom,” self-sacrifice,
passivity.

The participants in the
sexuality workshops share
what each has learned about
sex while growing up and
“reparent” themselves with
positive sex attitudes. They
also need to get in touch with
and become responsible for
their sexuality, says the
therapist. “Giving people the
permission to talk about their
sexuality gives them permis-
sion to talk about who they
are.” It is also important to
show people that “they are not
responsible for their feelings
but are responsible for what
they do about their feelings.
It's OK to get turned on by
someone or something. What
matters is what you do about
it.”

The sexuality classes will
hopefully begin to be held in
the community so they can
help para-professional or pro-
fessional people deal with
their sexuality and therefore
their clients’. The Institute is
now working on a form to
send to Denver area sex
therapists to find what their
values are and make that
available to the community.

An example of the resist-
ance displayed toward the entire
idea of sexuality discussion
has been shown by Denver
General Hospital, according
to Fortier. Sexuality work-
shops are being held at DGH
for staff people of the Family
Planning Clinic. It seems that
the clinic works with family
planning and nobody knows
about sex. An important
aspect of the workshop is for
each staff member to be able
to bring a “significant other”
to the workshop. But the
administration said no and so
by not allowing this bond,
sexuality and work are kept
separate, says Fortier. “This
creates a compartmentaliza-
tion of their existence,” and
the program would then seem
to be at a disadvantage.

Jean Fortier is involved in
the humanistic approach to
self-growth. She works with
women's Gestalt and human
sexuality groups. She can be
reached at the Gestalt Insti-
tute, 831-7731.

Side Effects
of the Pill

The most serious side ef-
fects of the pill include:
thromboembolism, or blood
clotting: Estrogen in the pill
may cause unnecessary clot
forms within a blood vessel,
obstructing the flow of blood
and starving body tissue.
Thromboembolism can have
serious and even fatal con-
sequences.

Strokes: Estrogen in the
pill causes blood pressure to
increase in susceptible wo-
men. High blood pressure
increases the chance of a
stroke, which is the rupture of
a blood vessel leading to or
from the brain. Severe, debili-
tating headache is a stroke
symptom. If severe headache
is experienced when taking
the pill, a doctor should be
consulted to rule out the
possibility of stroke.

Women should NEVER take
the pill if they have or have
ever had thromboembolism,
thrombophlebitis, pulmonary
embolism, a stroke, retinal
thrombosis, heart disease or
defect, severe endocrine dis-
order, recurrent jaundice of
pregnancy, or any form of
cancer.

Nuisance effects of the pill
are many. They include
nausea, fluid retention,
weight gain, giant freckles on
the face, excessive vaginal
discharge, changes in facial
or body hair, mood changes,
fatigue, oily scalp and skin,
breast enlargement, break-
through bleeding, yeast or
fungus infections, and other
metabolic side effects.

Small Changes, 1972  
Marge Piercy  
Fawcett Paperback  
$1.75  

Reviewed by Sandia  

This, Marge Piercy’s second  
novel, follows the lives of two  
women—Beth and Miriam—in  
finely drawn portrait mini-  
atures blown up generation  
size. For in their lives, as they  
move through the paroxysms  
of the 60’s and into the 70’s,  
weaves the thread of our own  
lives from childhood to  
womanhood. For some of us  
the process of growth and  
radicalization stops as it does  
with Miriam; for others of us  
it has been a constant renewal  
as with Beth.  

Beth goes through a famil-  
iar pattern: she marries, she  
despairs, she flees the mar-  
riage. Once in Boston, she  
begins an odyssey of self that  
eventually defines her as  
outlaw. Though the paperback  
cover intrigues us with the  
suggestion that she will end  
up in the arms of another  
woman, it is purposeful that  
the theme of woman loving  
woman does not develop until  
late in the story.  

The length of the novel has  
been subject to some critici-  
sm, but in order to appreciate  
Beth's transformation, as well  
as Miriam’s stagnation, it is  
necessary as the title sug-  
gests to witness incident by  
incident, mind by mind, the  
stages of change that indeed  
we all go through. Beth’s  
relationship with Wanda real-  
istically comes as it does with  
so many women in this  

society only after the expect-  
ed things are done, only after  
the assaults on our dignity,  
and that final “click” that  
suddenly puts things in  
perspective.  

Miriam, who begins as the  
stronger female figure of the  
two, is the portrait of near  
disintegration. Her background  
is no less familiar though the  
details of her Jewish upbringing  
in New York are surfacely  
different from those of Beth. She goes  
from fat Miriam Berg to  
sensual Miriam Stone only to  
find that her marriage to the  
“exceptional” man, Neil, can-  
not give her what she truly  
needs. Neil’s characterization  
underlines an important truth:  
men, while chasing, hunting  
the free spirits that women are  
before they are wives, are  
loving, undemanding, able to  
give. These same men, once  
the prize is now property,  
become not only insensitive,  
but blind to the needs and  
space that all growing crea-  
tures require. The whole  
process of marriage leaves her  
less free than ever and her  
entrapment includes a whole  
series of rationales she uses  
to justify her life. What we see  
as readers that Miriam sadly  
cannot, is that while Beth is  
undergoing small changes  
that eventually add up to  
some kind of identity, Miriam  
continues to take more and  
more shit. Each layer piles up  
as she is forced to lose more  
and more of her spirit, until  
finally we see she is actually  
sitting on a large dung  

heap—only the tragedy is that  
Miriam may never see it for  
what it is and recover the lost  
notion of herself. Although  
she helps Beth and Wanda  
kidnap back Wanda’s child-  
ren, it is an exciting momen-  
tary identity she shares with  
the women; she cannot  
understand the total com-  
mitment to women that Beth  
makes.  

The men, while easily  
recognizable as types, are not  
lacking in dimension either.  
Jackson is the sardonic cynic,  
the austere ascetic. For him  
women are always sitting  
across from him in some  
social chess game. And he  
knows he can call mate at any  
time. Love with him is  
friction, conquest.  

Phil, the lost poet and  
ever-present child, at first he  
seems to come on as the  
sensitive young man who  
initiates Miriam, but he too is  
also devoid of any ultimate  
empathy. One incident in the  
book makes this so clear. He  
goes and screws Laverne, the  
wife of Ryan. Ryan had  
“raped” Miriam at a business  
conference. In his logical  
male mind, Phil was using  
Laverne to even the score and  
announces this matter of  
factly to Miriam as though  
Laverne were just anyone's  
pawn—some object in some-  
one else’s arena.  

It is against these men who  
filter out the feminine in us  
that the strength and beauty  
of Wanda emerges. She is  
glimpsed early in the novel  

as the wife of Joe Rosario (or  
more aptly put, Joe’s old lady)  
leftist revolutionary. She is  
bedraggled, seen as a burden  
to Joe’s activities. As his wife  
she has no character. As  
Wanda, the leader of a  
women’s theater, she is fiery.  
She nearly becomes the  
goddess incarnate in her  
sense of the eternal feminine.  
Her dialogue and comments  
are at once the most inspiring  
and the most controversial.  

When Wanda is subpoenaed  
by a Grand Jury investigating  
Joe even though she had not  
been with him for three years,  
she refuses to answer any  
questions despite the threat of  
imprisonment. To answer one  
question is to answer them all,  
to destroy “the whole web of connec-  
tions in the movement.”  
Wanda is at that stage of  
consciousness where the  
movement that she identifies  
with includes the boys on the  
left, third world people, liberal  
women. Her explanation to  
Beth is that she won't carry  
Joe on her back any more, and  
further, “he isn’t my worst  
enemy.”  

For Wanda the enemy is  
still the state who makes war,  
the corporations who poison  
the earth for profit. The  
system. She doesn’t see the  
system as men, for she  
praises Joe for having made it  
in the white man’s world  
without seeing Joe as part of

The first KOA television  
special on women, one of the  
programs local groups had  
fought the station so hard for,  
was aired on Channel 4, Sept.  
29. The hour-long program  
called “Women in the Media,”  
was for the most part as  
unimaginative as its title.  
Even the technical aspects of  
the program were monoton-  

ous.  
Almost totally lacking in  
continuity or thought, the  
show’s basic premise seems  
to have been, “Well, let’s go  
find some women in the  
media and talk to them.”  
Actually, the special ran more  
like a public relations release  
for KOA and other local  
stations than a program  
dealing intelligently with wo-  
men in the media.  

Perhaps the most discour-  
aging aspect of this show was  

the complete lack of discus-  

sion or analysis concerning the  
issues of women in relation to  
the media. Even the recent  
battle with KOA to win a small  
amount of air time went  
unsaid and most of the  
women who spoke were eager  
to point out how wonderful it  
all was, how few problems  
they had, and how pleased  
they were to be there at all.  
There was no anger, no life,  

no controversy and no one  
willing to say very much about  
anything. There was little  
discussion about the strug-  
gles of women in the media,  
how they were treated as  
women or what special things  
women themselves could do  
with the power of the media.  

Questions about what wo-  
man’s function could be in  
one of the most powerful  
male-dominated fields in the  
world were not even raised.  
Just the fact that “a woman's  
function in” needs to be said  
at all is revealing; women  
certainly do not control or  
even influence the media very  
much.  

On the program, however,  
the role of women in the  
media simply became a matter  
of changing the projectionist.  
Nauseatingly enough, the  
only real point which the show  
made was that women could  
indeed become a part of the  
media if they worked hard and  
“weren't too radical,” as  
Rosemary Barnwell said. That  
a few women can be success-  
ful is not even a point. A few  
women can, but so what?  
Limited individual achieve-  
ment has nothing to do with  
women gaining any power in  
the total construct.  

Same Old Way  

We'll still have shows that  
are violent, racist, and sexist  
and we'll still have commer-  
cials that are as repugnant as  
the ones that were inserted in  
this very special on women.  
Only now we'll have women  
who call themselves “camera-  

men” doing the shooting,  
women writing the violent  
scripts about men killing each  
other and raping women, and  
women broadcasting the news  
that men make about them-  
selves. How very wonderful  
that women can do the same  
things that men do and in the  
very same ways. How very  
disappointing.  

The next upcoming special  
will be dealing with women in  
sports and women in the  
National Organization for Wo-  
men. I only hope that they will  
show more consciousness,  
more vitality, and more  
controversy than this one did.  
I also hope that the programs  
will not be both directed,  
produced, and engineered by  
Manny Cantu and Sam Hous-  
ton or any other such  
unimaginative people. I feel  
that one of the biggest  
reasons this first special on  
women was so dull was  
because men with no real  
interest or knowledge of  
women and women’s issues  
were in such key positions. I  
had the overwhelming feeling  
that the show was just put  
together because there had to  
be a show about women. A  
we-have-to-do-it-so-here-it-is  
kind of attitude. These spe-  
cials are for and about  
women; they should be the  
products of many women and  
many women with a feminist  
awareness!

the problem. The point that  
Wanda—and Piercy—miss is  
that Joe is the system also.  
That it is not only our politics  
but our sex which is at issue.  
Joe is part of the total sexist  
oppression as his actions  
toward Wanda make clear.  
This section is the strongest  
political statement of the  
book, and Wanda’s position  
becomes one of confronting  
the system with our bodies if  
necessary. A fine leftist  
statement, but not a feminist  
solution.  

Wanda is one of the most  
vivid portraits in all Lesbian  
literature, but with important  
differences. In contrast to the  
previous treatment of Lesbi-  
ans in literature, she and Beth  
are not solely viewed in terms  
of bedroom issues. Piercy has  
created a novel which tran-  
scends the usual structure in  
American literature of one  
male hero who confronts the  
violence around him and  
extracts from that some ideas  
about the meaning of life.  
Small Changes with its  
collective persona distills our  
perceptions through the eyes  

of several characters. Wo-  
men’s love for women be-  
comes a part of the total  

vision, and hopefully Piercy  
and other women will contin-  
ue to refine the possibilities of  
art in that direction.

Among the many projects
underway, the Lesbian Task
Force of NOW has begun two
consciousness-raising
groups. One group is for

women who are just coming
out (or women who are
beginning to define them-
selves as Lesbians). This
group meets Thursday nights
at 7:30 p.m. at 1545 Vine #7.
The other group is for all
women of any sexual orienta-
tion and will explore what it
means to be a woman and to
be sexual. This group meets
on Monday nights at 7:30
p.m. at 1545 Vine #7. All
women are welcome to attend
either group.

Another activity sponsored
by the Lesbian Task Force is a
women’s coffeehouse, held
the 4th Friday of every month
at Denver Free University (17th
& Park) at 9:00 p.m. Upcoming
events at the coffeehouse
include bingo night, Tarot and
palm reading, feminist music,
poetry, dancing, refreshments,
and possibly complete, homestyle meals. Fem-
inist and Lesbian materials
are also on sale at the
coffeehouse, and all women
are welcome.

Because large amounts of
time and money are needed
for educational and informa-
tional materials in the massive
gay effort to introduce and
pass gay antidiscrimination
bills in the 1975 Colorado
State Legislature, the Lesbian
Task Force has several fund-
raising events coming up. We

DES-Morning After Pill
PP, HEW Use Women

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (LNS)
--The Planned Parenthood
League of Connecticut in
conjunction with the Yale
Medical School has conduct-
ed experiments on 600 women
from across the state, to test
the “morning-after pill.” The
money used for the experi-
ment comes from a $132,000
grant from the Department of
Health, Education, and Wel-
fare.

Known to cause cancer in
laboratory animals and in the
children of women who have
taken it, the drug - diethylstil-
bestrol (DES) - contains a
massive dose of synthetic
estrogen, equivalent to a
four-year supply of birth
control pills.

Women in the experiment
are given a series of ten pills
containing 250 milligrams of
DES, which are taken during a
five-day period 24 to 72 hours
following intercourse.

DES has long been opposed
by women’s groups, health
and consumer organizations.
Evidence shows that it caused
cancer of the vagina and
cervix in at least 200 daugh-
ters whose mothers took it
during pregnancy to prevent
miscarriages. Twenty-four of
the young women are known
to have died as of July 1974.

The drug also causes
serious side effects in the
women who take the pills.
Besides the usual nausea,
vomiting, sweating and va-
ginal bleeding, a woman may
experience other side effects
linked to estrogens. Blood
clots, hypertension, migraine,
development of breast cysts,
loss of hair, hyperthyroid
conditions, diabetic reac-
tions, changes in eye pres-
sure, depression, and person-
ality changes have been
reported.

Even after DES was banned
from cattle feed in 1972 (the
ban was overturned in Jan-
uary 1974 on a technicality) it
was approved for “emergency
use” as a morning-after
contraceptive drug. The Food
and Drug Administration
(FDA) recommends its use

Page 15

only in extreme emergency
cases, such as rape, warning
that “it shouldn’t be consid-
ered as a method for birth
control with continuous and
frequently repeated therapy.”

However, testimony before
the Senate Subcommittee on
Health in 1973 reveals that the
unauthorized use of DES as a
contraceptive is widespread.
While doctors are supposed to
prescribe the drug only for
“emergency use,” there are no
limits on the doctors’ judge-
ment of exactly what consti-
tutes an emergency.

In addition, DES is ap-
proved for use in treating
diseases, including endome-
triosis - an abnormality of
the uterus - and, ironically,
cancer in the lining of the
uterus.

Eli Lilly of Indianapolis - the
largest single marketer of DES
for human use - correctly
predicted, after the FDA
ruling on emergency use:

Self Exam

for Breast Cancer

1. Sit or stand in front of your mirror, arms re-
laxed at your sides and look for any
changes in size, shape, contour. Also look
for puckering or dimpling of the skin and
changes in the surface of the nipples. Gently
press each nipple to see if any discharge
occurs.

2. Raise both arms over your head and look
for exactly the same things. Note differ-
ences since you last examined your breasts.

3. From there on you will be trying to find a
lump or thickening. Lie down on your bed,
put a pillow or bath towel under your left
shoulder and your left hand under your
head. With the fingers of your right hand
held flat, press gently against the breast
with small circular motions to feel the in-
ner, upper portion of your left breast,
starting at your breastbone and going out-
ward toward the nipple line. Also feel the
area around the nipple.

4. Now bring your left arm down to your side.
Still using the flat part of the fingers of your
right hand, feel under your left armpit.

5. Use the same gentle pressure to feel the
upper, outer portion of your left breast from
the nipple line to where your arm is resting.

6. Repeat the entire procedure, as described,
on the right breast using the left hand for
the examination.

7. And finally, feel the lower outer portion of
your breast, going from the outer part to
the nipple.

If you find a lump or thickening, leave it
alone until you see your doctor. Don't be
frightened. Most breast lumps or changes
are not cancer, but only a doctor can tell."

Publishers, Lawmakers Finally
See Sexism in Textbooks

Nancy Heine

“Examples of stereotyping
to be avoided: scatterbrained
female, fragile flower, god-
dess on a pedestal, catty
gossip, hen-pecking shrew,
apron-wearing mother, frus-
trated spinster...”

Editors at the McGraw-Hill
Book Co. have sharpened
their pencils and begun
attacking sexist educational
texts they publish. And
they're not alone. Other
publishers have joined the
battle.

According to studies on
sex-role stereotyping in text-
books, plenty of editing is in
order. Though 51% of the US
population is female, the
studies discovered men far
outnumbering women in texts
at all grade levels. Women
who were presented were
shown as servile, fearful,
passive and dependent.

In a study of 554 elementary
readers, researcher Diane
Graebner found a ratio of
three boys to every two girls.
She determined that 75% of
all stories were about boys
and that boys made up 67.5%
of all illustrations. She found
that girls were depicted as
shallow and “mothers” invari-
ably wore skirts—even while
camping or hiking down the
Grand Canyon.

When the Women on Words
and Images (WWI) went
through 134 readers from 14
publishers, they found boys
outnumbering girls five to two
as lead characters in stories.
Their study uncovered six
biographies of a female. In
mathematics books, WWI
found boys solving astronomy
and chemistry problems and
learning to buy stocks while
girls measured curtains and
bought flour.

An investigation of social
studies texts by Richard
O’Donnell revealed 83% of the
occupations described be-
longed to males and only 17%
to females. The occupations

for females included waitresses,
housewives, secretaries
and other service or home-ori-
ented jobs. Seventy-two
males had prestigious jobs
while only one female was
shown in a similar role.
O'Donnell never found a male
doing dishes, cleaning or
handling childcare duties.

Perhaps the most exhaust-
ive research on high school
civic texts was published in
the book “You Won’t Do”:
What Textbooks on US Gov-
ernment Teach High School
Girls. Dr. Jennifer Macleod,
research psychologist, and
Sandra Silver(wo)man, femin-
ist consultant, dissected eight
leading civics texts and found
little mention of women in the
US political process.

They discovered that illus-
trations vastly underrepre-
sented women. Whereas 51 to
73% of the pictures showed
only men, a scant 3 to 9%
showed only women. They
saw only two pictures of
women in nontraditional
roles—Senator Margaret
Chase Smith holding a bou-
quet of roses and Rep. Patsy
Mink throwing snowballs.

The researchers noted that
all political leaders were
drawn as male stick figures in
charts. In one book's intro-
ductory unit, “Understanding
Democracy,” a six-sketch
montage shows: a man
running for office; a man
reading about a male candi-
date; three men discussing
politics; a man watching a
three-man TV debate; a man
cheering a male candidate,
and a man voting.

Macleod and Silver(wo)man
found the reading matter no
less stereotyping. They un-
covered statements like: “the
ideal presidential candidate
is...an energetic member of
the male sex...Some day
perhaps, a Negro, a Jew, even
a woman, may have some
prospect of being the party
(presidential) nominee.”

While researchers, psycho-
logists and educators comb
textbooks for further evidence
of sex-role stereotyping, fed-
eral and state governments
have taken some steps to
eliminate the school book
sexism. Two bills which may
have some effect have already
been passed by Congress and
another is pending.

One of these bills, Title IX
of the Educational Amend-
ments of 1972, says that no
person on the basis of sex
shall “be subjected to dis-
crimination under any educa-
tional program” receiving fed-
eral funds. Whether or not this
covers the subject of text-
books has been a matter of
debate.

The New York Times noted
that Title IX failed “to cover
discriminatory curriculum
materials, such as textbooks
that contain sex bias.” The
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare (HEW) added
that any attempt to ban the
use of such materials “would
raise grave constitutional
questions under the First
Amendment.”

According to Wilma
Scott Heide, past president of
the National Organization for
Women (NOW), “selection of
sexist texts by state action
(via the public school boards)
is a denial of individual First
Amendment rights of freedom
of speech by excluding,
derogating, and/or stereotyp-
ing women.”

Dr. Anne Scott, NOW
Legislative Vice President has
observed that, as is, there is
nothing in Title IX “that makes
a school system accountable
to its required statement of
non-discrimination.”

Another bill dealing with
sexist texts, the Women’s
Educational Equity Act of
1973, was recently signed by
President Ford. The bill
authorizes $30 million per year
to “encourage the develop-
ment of new and improved
curriculums” and to imple-
ment community-oriented ed-
ucational programs on women
in American history.

Senator Charles Percy has
introduced another bill to
Congress that would ensure
even more funding to “help
women gain their place as
equal beneficiaries of socie-
ty.” Percy’s bill, the Women’s
Equal Educational Opportunity
Act, is still in committee.

But while the federal
government continues decision-
making over the matter,
eight state governments have
already outlawed sexism in
education and texts. For
instance, in California sexist
textbooks must be phased out
by 1975.

And publishing houses
have begun ferreting out sexist
references in their books. J.B.
Lippincott, the D.C. Heath
Co. and Harper and Row all
have said they are carefully
examining their manuscripts
for offensive sex-role stereo-
typing.

McGraw-Hill, which has
recently published an 11-page
“Guidelines for Equal Treat-
ment of the Sexes” stated:
“We realize that the language
of literature cannot be pre-
scribed, but we want to
encourage a greater freedom
for all individuals to pursue
their interests and realize their
potentials.”

FRUSTRATION IN ASPEN

Dear People,

I am not good with words,  
but I would like to describe to  
you my frustration after  
attending several meetings of  
the Aspen Women’s Caucus.

I entered a plush office with  
six or seven rather wealthy  
women sitting and talking. I  
had just come from the First  
Annual Colorado Women’s  
Festival in Denver, at which I  
was extremely impressed by  
the strong feelings of sister-  
hood or woman power or  
both. I wanted to extend these  
feelings to them and give a  
thorough description of the  
festival. I lost their interest  
after about one minute.

These are women who think  
that looking natural is a new  
style of make-up application.

The majority of jobs in  
Aspen “for women” are maids  
and waitresses, emphasizing  
hard fast work, low pay and  
lots of bullshit. The women of  
the Caucus haven't had to take  
these jobs - they feel no need  
to worry about, discuss, much  
less fight for the causes of a  
poor sector of women.

What depressed me most  
was their competition for the  
floor, to hear themselves  
speak of themselves. They  
want this more than to hear  
new ideas. I’m about five to  
ten years younger than most of  
them and have no kids to  
discuss.

The really poor part of the  
whole thing is that Aspen is  
full of world and country-wide  
travelers who bring ideas, but  
if they aren’t a big name or  
look influential, they sure the  
hell don’t get any attention  
from the more long-term  
Aspen Women’s Caucus-ers.

I'd really like to start a new  
group of NOW in Aspen. I've  
met several others who are  
interested. Rather than sitting  
on the sidelines listening to  
the Aspen Women’s Caucus  
people discuss their affect-  
atious problems of make-up  
and men we could be acting -  
filing discrimination suits.  
(The men here simply say “We  
don't hire women.” and “I hate  
to even be asked the ques-  
tion.”)

Aspen is set in some  
beautiful mountains, but that  
is the only good thing about  
it. The rest is damn sour  
grapes for everyone who  
works for a living and even  
some who don’t.

GOOD WORK!

Dear BMR,

You're doing something  
very important with BMR.  
What you extend to Colorado  
women is invaluable, and I  
hope their support shows you  
eventually.

I hope to be able to  
contribute more later... I am  
new to Denver and am still  
getting my bearings. I never  
thought I would enjoy being  
stared at, but it’s a great trip  
when I walk into Jerry’s to get  
the latest BMR (and Playgirl -  
I get Amazon Quarterly at  
home): all the guys really give  
me the once-over. They’re just  
jealous - they don’t under-  
stand!

Keep on truckin’ women -  
there are clamoring readers  
out here who need you!

READER BLASTS BMR

Dear BMR,

In view of the feminist  
school meeting I attended at  
BMR, the Denver Post article  
on BMR, several editorials by  
Janet Sergi (Ed. note: col-  
umns by individuals are not  
editorials) and Linda Fowler  
which appeared in BMR I  
would like to say:

1.) I do not believe in some  
“pie-in-the-sky”  
the “feminine principle.” I do  
not like cryptic generalizations.  
I do not like being categorized--  
“All women are close to  
the earth, cooperative, sup-  
portive, expressive, non-de-  
structive.” I am a person!?! I  
would like to think I am a  
person and I would like the  
right to define myself. Please  
stop being so chauvinistic!

2.) I feel the Denver Post  
article was basically accurate.  
I do feel sorry that BMR’s  
problems--once only her  
problems--are now public  
knowledge.

3.) I disagree with the  
statement (in one of your  
editorials) that “Lesbians are  
women whose primary com-  
mitment is to other women.”  
This may be true, but not  
necessarily so. Are all Les-  
bians feminists? Is sexual  
behavior the center of life;  
does it determine everything  
else? What about friendships,  
feelings, and ideas? I respect  
Lesbians as people and those  
that are working in the  
feminist movement. However,  
I do not like being made to  
feel put down or guilty  
because I’m not Lesbian. You  
(BMR) have created a hier-  
archy 1.) Lesbian Feminists  
2.) feminists 3.) non-femin-  
ists.

4.) I do feel it is necessary  
for most American women,  
Lesbian or not, to learn to  
co-exist with men because  
we can't get away from them.  
That's why I believe a feminist  
school should be both boys  
and girls together so girls can  
actively and aggressively learn  
to cope with boys so they  
won't be destroyed and boys  
learn to live and play with girls  
without exploiting and  
hurting them. BMR has  
already created a hierarchy of  
schools: 1.) feminist 2.)  
non-sexist. Will you need to  
carry the hierarchy further? 1.)  
daughters of Lesbian Femin-  
ists only, 2.) daughters of  
feminists 3.) sons and  
daughters of feminists 4.)  
daughters and sons of any-  
body!

5.) I do not feel that there is  
only one perfect man who is  
perfectly non-sexist. I do feel,  
however, that there are men  
who have qualities of cooper-  
ation, expression, support-  
iveness, and who really try not  
to be destructive to women. I  
do not feel that there is only  
one perfect woman, Lesbian  
or non-Lesbian, who is  
perfectly non-sexist either. In  
fact, I have met some real  
women pigs--Lesbian and  
non-Lesbian. I have been  
deeply hurt and exploited by  
women, Lesbian and non-les-  
bian.

6.) I feel some of the  
statements that have ap-  
peared in BMR are female  
chauvinism. “You know  
women are all alike--besides  
being born with vaginas and  
clitorises they all come out of  
the womb stamped in pink  
‘feminine principle.’ Then  
there are little pink stamps all  
over them which say, COOP-  
ERATIVE, NON-DESTRUCT-  
IVE, CLOSE TO EARTH,  
EXPRESSIVE, PROTECTIVE.”  
Yvonne Stith  
(ADMITTED NON-LESBIAN)

POST REPORTER SAYS WHAT HE  
REALLY THINKS ABOUT BMR

Ed. Note: The following is a personal note to Ivan Goldman  
following his Denver Post article of Sept. 8, and the reply received  
which was written on Post stationery!

Dear Mr. Goldman,

I find your lack of integrity appalling. Your misrepresenta-  

Sept. 11

tions were both numerous and disgusting.

Oct. 1, 1974  
Dear Ms. Fowler,

I just returned from vacation to receive your little note. It was so  
moving I thought I'd let you know that the CIA is out to get you.  
You're that important. So watch the bastards. They're devious.  
I'd tell you more, but I’ve jeopardized myself too much already.

And, just in case you still don’t understand (which I’m sure is  
quite possible) enjoy your paranoia. It’s all you've got:

Best,

HEW EXPERIMENTS

WITH DES

make a significant change in  
Lilly’s sales or profits.”  
Presently, the company faces  
a lawsuit brought by a Royal,  
Michigan woman who has  
vaginal cancer because her  
mother took DES during her  
pregnancy.

Clinics are allowed to  
administer DES for emergency  
contraceptive use - but sup-  
posedly only in extremely  
controlled and carefully fol-  
lowed-up medical experi-  
ments. Yet it is reported that  

follow-up procedures are in-  
adequate, and prior warnings  

are few. Women are not  

warned of the cancer risk to  
themselves or to the fetus,  
should the pill fail.

Although all of the women  
in the Connecticut experiment  
must consent to an abortion  
should the conception occur,  
the service is not provided by  
Planned Parenthood, stated  
its Connecticut director,  
Kenneth Pruett. Only advice  
will be offered.

Police Attack Women, Then Try to Charge the Women With  
Battery-- Two employees of the Woman's Building in LA were beaten  
up by three peace officers in an “unprovoked attack” early in Aug.  
The officers then tried to charge the women with battery at a  
hearing attended by 100 supporters on Sept. 12. Cheryl Swanneck,  
one of the feminists involved, gives this account: “I had been  
welding. A police car began to cruise alongside of us when we  
were locking up. We said we worked in the building and went in to  
get our things... We thought the police had left but they suddenly  
banged on the door and threatened to “break it down”... When  
they tried to take Marge Elliot out to the parking lot, I told her she  
didn’t have to go. An officer grabbed Margie and threw her face  
down and then began to strangle her. Another hit her on the back.  
I began to scream; they dropped Margie, lifted me off the steps,  
crashed me down on the steps, broke my glasses and began to  
strangle me. I passed out and fell down the steps. They tortured  
me with, “Are you going to cooperate now, little girl?” I was crying  
hysterically. * The police report of the incident said that two  
possible burglary suspects who “looked like men” were reported  
“looking suspicious.” The report further stated that one woman  
(Swanneck) was asked to step outside; she refused and struck the  
officer. A wristlock was then used on the woman. It was further  
reported in the police account that as a result of the struggle one  
officer sustained an injury to his right middle finger.” * The  
hearing determined that no charges should be brought against the  
women, but Swanneck and Elliot are filing their own civil suit  
against the three policemen involved. (Sister, Sept. and Oct. '74)

Jumping Rope May Be Hazardous to Your Health!-- Physicians  
say that the nerves of the limbs or of the spine may be paralyzed  
by jumping or skipping rope. The delicate nerves of the foot are  
also liable to suffer permanent injury from the jar of jumping, and  
the amusement puts a strain on other nerves of the body which  
may cause paralysis. (The Ruined Maid by Geoffrey Eley,  
England, ’70)

The Times Has A Limited Vocabulary-- Women in Washington  
recently protested the advertising policies of the Seattle Times  
after the newspaper singled out and removed the phrase “Lesbian  
literature” from a list of material advertised by the “Madwoman”  
feminist bookstore. The Times then charged the bookstore $2.50  
extra for the editing. About 50 women and children marched  
through the downtown area singing songs and carrying signs  
such as “Lesbians Are Everywhere-- But In The Times,” “The  
Times Has a Limited Vocabulary,” and “The Times Is Behind The  
Times.” (LNS and Pandora)

It Only Took Two Centuries-- After 210 years of publishing, the  
Hartford Courant in Conn. finally named a woman (Laura Johnson)  
as director. (Media Report to Women, Oct. 1, '74)

Creep of the Month Award-- goes to Red Fenwick for his recent  
column in the Denver Post called “Protestors Boil at Pay Toilet.”  
Proving his minimal understanding of the Women's Movement,  
Ridin’-the-Range-Red disparaged the WM by reducing the issues  
to matters of lighting cigarettes and integrating public toilets (a  
ridiculous notion promulgated by the male media for their own  
ends). Further demonstrating his total ignorance on the subject,  
Fen then went on to claim the movement had “reached a climax 2  
years ago.” A “believer in male equality” himself, Mr. Wick’s  
supposedly satirical column was replete with insults to women  
and was extremely offensive to anyone with intelligent  
sensibilities. Personally, I think the issue of pay toilets is a low  
level priority in relationship to the goals of the Women’s  
Movement, but to the male media the toilet issue was just their  
cup of tea. I’m not surprised--that’s usually where heads are at  
anyway. (Denver Post, Oct. 13, '74)

All Male Senate Hurts Women-- With not one woman in the U.S.  
Senate, the men voted 50 to 34 to deny Health, Education and  
Welfare funds to be used by women for abortions. With Bella  
Abzug battling in the House, however, a similar amendment was  
defeated. Voting to deny abortion funding were such “friends” as  
McGovern, Eagleton, McIntyre, Montoya, Pastore, Byrd, Church,  
Hartke, Huddleston, Mansfield, McGee, and Muskie. Other  
senatorial “friends” not voting were Tunney, Ribicoff, Bayh,  
Bentson, and Nelson. The bill will now go to conference to resolve  
the difference between the House and Senate votes. (The Woman  
Activist, Sept. 15, '74) Quotation marks around the word “friends”  
are mine. WA, oddly enough, did not see any contradictions in the  
use of the word to describe these senators.

training staff puts together a
variety of workshops and
seminars related to human
sexuality, family planning and
management. Some of the
programs offered can be taken
for credit at the University of
Northern Colorado. The Planned
Parenthood people feel
that an important aspect of
their work involves public
education. To that end, the
agency will furnish brochures,
films and speakers not only to
explain contraceptives and
family planning services, but
also to assist groups studying
topics like the population
problem or human sexuality.
Developing Finances

Obviously, an agency offering
this range of services
needs a broad financial base.
And Rocky Mountain Planned
Parenthood, a non-profit or-
ganization, is developing that.
Services such as problem
pregnancy counseling, abor-
tion clinics, vasectomy coun-
seling, and vasectomy clinics
are supported totally by the
persons using them. Almost
all other functions of the
agency are paid for by a
combination of funds. An
important part of the financ-
ing comes from patient fees in
the contraceptive clinic. State
and federal (HEW) monies add
supplemental funding, which
is rarely guaranteed for more
than a year at a time. Private
tax-deductible donations
make up the remainder of the
income. Despite these various
sources of financial assist-
ance, RMPP consistently

seeks additional funding to

meet the increasing demand
for family planning services in
Colorado.

Being a private agency and
receiving some government
aid puts RMPP in a unique
position. The fact that it is
private means that Planned
Parenthood can change pol-
icies more quickly with fewer
bureaucratic hassles than a
public agency. Also, the
staff and administration
feel freer to be innovative and
can expect less public re-
action because the agency is
private. This is an important
point when one works in an
area as intimate and personal
as family planning. However,

a positive result of RMPP
using HEW monies is that the
consumers of Planned Par-
enthood services have the
opportunity to be on a
Participant Advisory Council
(PAC). It is a channel for
patients to tell the agency
what they feel and how they
would prefer clinics to func-
tion. Any regular contracept-
ive patient can ask to be on
the PAC for her clinic.

Human Component

The PAC is just one of the
human components running
Planned Parenthood. There
are also administrators and
staff who are paid to keep the
whole operation going on a
consistent basis. They are the
ones that patients come in
contact with, so they can truly
make a clinic visit dreadful,
tolerable or positive. Volun-
teers who work in clinics or
serve on administrative
boards supply valuable kinds
of support to the entire RMPP
system.

All these persons have two
common commitments. The
first is to free women and men
from the burden of unplanned
or unwanted births, no matter
what their income or lifestyle
or race or culture happens to
be. That means the patient
decides if she or he will have
any children and if so, when
children are desirable and how
many are wanted. The second
one is to assist people in
understanding and taking
healthy care of their bodies.

These are not easy commit-
ments. There are many taboos
and misconceptions and re-
sentments that make those
commitments difficult. How-
ever, Colorado residents con-
tinue to come to Rocky Moun-
tain Planned Parenthood in
increasing numbers, with
needs for more varied services
than ever before. So the
people working at RMPP try to
improve those services and
deliver them in the most

efficient and personable way
possible.

“The largest area of the
HANDBOOK is devoted to
gonorrhea so that ‘we can rid
ourselves of this unnecessary
and unpleasant complication
to sexual freedom’. Gonorrhea
is transmitted through vagi-
nal, anal or oral-gential
intercourse and presently
afflicts 2,000,000 Americans a
year. Eighty percent of the
women infected with gonor-
rhea have no symptoms for
the first few weeks or months
until complications set in,
while men have symptoms in
three to five days. Thus the
need for partners to inform
each other becomes acute....

Menstrual Extraction Controversial

Menstrual extraction, or
endometrial aspiration, is a
process by which the uterine
lining is removed from a
woman at the time when her
monthly period is due. A four
to six mm cannula is
introduced through a suction
pump, and uterine lining is
removed all at once. The
process takes about 60
seconds. If menstrual extrac-
tion is performed within 5 to
10 days after the date the
menstrual period is due, the
menstrual lining of the uterus
and any fertilized egg which
might have been implanted
there will be removed.

There are several controver-
sies surrounding the use of
this technique. First, there is
considerable discussion as to
whether the technique should
be used at all. Supporters
argue that (1) the use of the
cannula simplifies the abor-
tion procedure by virtually

treatment from a doctor who
will not accompany it with a
thorough explanation. It then
devotes four pages to the
types of medicines, dosages
and methods of administration
(injection, pills, etc.) most
effective. The negative effects
of certain drugs, alternative
medicines for those with
allergies, and medicines to be
avoided during pregnancy are
also detailed...

“There is a beautiful effort
to rid the HANDBOOK of
sexism and racism. Doctors
are not ‘he’ but ‘he or she’ and
a woman or a man’s sexual
partner is a ‘sexual partner’ or
‘lover’ not a specific sex.
Heterosexual and homosexual
relationships are dealt with
side by side with no bias
indicated. And drugs harmful
to specific people (such as

eliminating the need for
dilation of the cervix and
anesthesia. (2) Menstrual ex-
traction represents a faster
and less expensive method of
terminating a possible preg-
nancy test. Opponents of the
procedure argue that (1) the
technique is still experimen-
tal, (2) it is not painless and
women who have not had
children often require anes-
thesia, (3) it is not totally
reliable as an abortion tech-
nique (4) Many of the women
who undergo the technique
are not pregnant, (5) there is
not enough evidence to
determine the rates of uterine
perforation and infection, and

to determine the long-range

side effects.

The second controversy
involves the question of who
should perform menstrual
extraction. One perspective
claims that the procedure is
only safe if it is performed by
a qualified doctor, whereas

ciency) are noted with every
treatment recommendation.

“Perhaps the only criticism
of the HANDBOOK would be
in the attitude of total reliance
on the medical profession for
treatment of such things as
monilia and trichomonas. The
self-help clinic approach to
yeast infections would be
recommendation of vinegar
douches and yogurt applica-
tions to the vagina to return
the vaginal lining to its natural
acid state and bacterial/yeast
balance, not conducive to
yeast overgrowth. But since
a majority of people still rely
on institutions, education
ourselves to deal with
those institutions is also an important step
toward receiving
better medical care.”

Birth Control

others believe that the pro-
cedure is simple enough that
anyone trained in the tech-
nique can perform it.

The third area of discussion
concerns the use of menstrual
extraction as a method of
controlling the monthly men-
strual cycle. Menstrual
regulation eliminates the in-
convenience and discomforts
of the monthly period as well
as functioning as a contra-
ceptive measure. However,
even those who advocate the
use of menstrual extraction as
an abortion technique caution
against the unknown side
effects of its repeated use.

Besides establishing new

women can learn the skills of

This approach, of course,

EDITOR: Dian Terry December, 1973

BY-LAWS CHANGES NOT RATIFIED  
Details next issue

NOW REFORMS MEDIA BROADCAST CODE

The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) has agreed to revisions to its Radio Code as proposed by NOW, following a presentation on the image of women in the media by NOW Vice President/Public Relations Toni Carabillo. At an earlier meeting of the NAB Television Code Review Board, the broadcasters agreed to the “thrust and spirit” of NOW’s changes for the television code, also presented by Toni Carabillo.

The revisions, prepared by Joan Nicholson (National Coordinator, Image of Women Task Force) and Whitney Adams (National Coordinator, FCC Task Force) were aimed at stricter guidelines for broadcasters in portraying women in programming and advertising. Joyce Snyder of New York NOW was highly instrumental in arranging NOW’s participation in the NAB Code conferences.

NAB officials have now strengthened their organization’s commitment to the improvement of the image of women in the media, with “reaffirmation, wider and intensified publicizing, and more insightful implementation . . . towards accomplishing the goals affecting the dignity, among others, of women . . . ” NOW will contribute a guest column in the NAB’s monthly CODE NEWS, to be followed by national and local NOW action currently being planned by Whitney Adams and the FCC Task Force and Joan Nicholson and the Image Task Force. Please send your suggestions to the NOW Public Information Office, 641 Lexington Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10022. In addition, the NAB is distributing copies of Toni Carabillo’s presentations to all stations which subscribe to the radio and television codes.

Nassau (Long Island, N. Y.) NOW came to the aid of a Long Island woman — with gain of a new  
member and victory over a ‘‘stag’’ dinner as its reward.

Petra Capon received an invitation to the $100-a-plate Pinter Tournament of Stars banquet, a  
charity event for the American Cancer Society emceed by Bob Hope. When she called to make  
reservations for 10 — a contribution of $1,000 — she was told the dinner was stag.

Ms. Capon contacted Nassau NOW. The case was taken to the New York State Human Rights  
Commission which ordered that women be allowed at the dinner.

Betty Schlein of Nassau NOW was among Ms. Capon’s guests. In all, about 100 women attended  
the banquet.

The many press reports quoted Ms. Capon’s intention to join NOW, “I never involved myself in  
any women’s liberation activities until it hit home,” she said. “I’m not against men, I'm for  
women.”

NOW AIDS N. J. WIN OVER LITTLE LEAGUE

A New Jersey court has ruled that the Little League in New Jersey must admit girls. The ruling  
was made November 7th following a long suit in which Judith Weis and Essex County NOW  
helped to refute testimony by Little League witnesses who claimed girls were not physically  
able to play baseball with boys.

Some reports say the Little League may take the case to the U. S. Supreme Court.

NATIONAL ACTION WILL HIT “CULT OF YOUTH”

December 19th is the date for actions by many NOW chapters throughout the country — all  
designed to combat the cult of youth as it applies to women.

According to Karen DeCrow, national coordinator for the action, “The tragedy of the cult of  
youth is not that men prefer young women, it is that we women begin to hate ourselves as  
we grow old.”

On December 19, 1853, Gerrit Smith, wealthy landowner, whose daughter Elizabeth first wore  
the bloomer dress, wrote to Elizabeth Cady Stanton: “So long as woman remains in her  
clothes-prison, she will be dependent and poor.” This year, NOW chapters will celebrate the  
100th anniversary of that letter.

Suggestions and background for this action have been sent to all NOW chapter presidents.  
For further information, contact Karen DeCrow, 116 Benedict Avenue, Syracuse, New York  
13210, (315) 474-1682.

CALIFORNIA NOW TASK FORCE TO COMBAT AGEISM

Is it “raging hormones” that make some menopausal women act out, or is it just plain rage?  
The need for feminist research in this area was stressed at the Workshop on Older Women at  
the California NOW State Conference, October 26-28. Job discrimination (both sexist and  
ageist), social security inequities and pension woes were also tackled. A task force was set up  
to “raise the consciousness of NOW members to ageism and the older women, as well as to  
implement programs to alleviate our problems.”

ABORTION  

ANTI-ABORTION AMENDMENT PASSES U. S. SENATE  

On October 2, 1973, Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) introduced an amendment (No. 566) to the  
Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 which prohibits the use of funds for abortion services, research  
on abortion, and for abortifacient drugs and devices (which include menstrual extraction and  
IUDs the way anti-abortion groups define it). This amendment passed the Senate unanimously.  
(NOTE: There are no women Senators).  

ANTI-ABORTION AMENDMENT IN CONFERENCE  

This amendment is currently under consideration by the Joint Conference Committee on the  
Foreign Assistance Act. Members of NOW in the relevant states have already been contacted  
and urged to write, call, and/or telegram their Senators and Representatives if they are members  
of the Conference Committee.  

So far, we are holding our own and the mail is running 50:50. However, to make sure the Conferees  
are not persuaded at the last minute to support any anti-abortion language in either the bill or the  
Conference Report Statement, which accompanies the bill to explain it, and is often used as an  
alternative method of expressing “the Will of Congress,” NOW MEMBERS IN THE CONFEREES’  
HOME STATES SHOULD WRITE AGAIN EXPRESSING THEIR OPPOSITION TO ANY MOVE  
BY THE CONFERENCE TO DENY ACCESS TO ABORTION TO OUR SISTERS OUTSIDE  
THE UNITED STATES. NOW members living in these states should write to the designated  
person immediately: Senators Humphrey (Minn), Aiken (Vt), Fulbright (Ark), Church (Id), and  
Case (NJ); Representatives Tom Morgan (Pa), Zablocki (Wisc), Hays (Oh), Fascell (Fla), Mailliard  
(Ca), Frelinghuysen (NJ), and Broomfield (Mich).  

Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 will contain no anti-  
abortion language until both the Senate and the House of Representatives have voted on and  
approved a Conference Report with no provisions against abortion services, research, and abortifacient  
drugs or devices in it.  

THEREFORE, ALL MEMBERS OF NOW ARE ASKED TO WRITE LETTERS, SEND PETITIONS,  
MAKE PHONE CALLS, AND OTHERWISE LET YOUR SENATORS AND HOUSE MEMBERS  
KNOW THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY OPPOSE THIS ATTEMPT BY ANTI-ABORTION FORCES  
TO DENY OTHER COUNTRIES THE RIGHT TO PROVIDE GOOD HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING  
EARLY ABORTIONS, TO THE WOMEN NOW LIVING AND POTENTIALLY DYING IN THOSE  
COUNTRIES IF THEY ARE DENIED OUR AID.  

FLASH! On November 13th, the Conference Committee voted to include anti-abortion language  
in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973. This was after assurances from members of the committee,  
including Senator Humphrey, that no anti-abortion language would be included. WRITE AND  
DEMAND A REVERSAL OF THIS ACTION!"
DoItNow,,,,6,DoItNow/DoitNowDec73_page006.txt,"MANDATORY PREGNANCY LEAVES

Recently there has been a great deal of litigation by women challenging the various mandatory
pregnancy leave statutes, regulations and policies. Many courts have declared mandatory pregnancy
leaves to be unconstitutional. A definitive ruling is expected soon from the United States Supreme
Court in the case of La Fleur v. Cleveland Board of Education, (465 F. 2d 1184). NOW has filed
an amicus curiae brief in La Fleur.
The successful cases to date are as follows:

a. Williams v. San Francisco Unified School District, 340 F. Supp. 438 (1972, California);
4. member of the armed services —

a. Robinson v. Rand, 340 F. Supp. 37 (1972, Colorado).

In all of the cases it was found that mandatory pregnancy leave statutes, regulations and policies
discriminate on the basis of sex. Selecting a certain indiscriminate period of time that a medical
leave must be taken for pregnancy is arbitrary and discriminatory because only pregnancy and
not other prolonged medical ailments were subject to these restrictions. Since pregnancy is a
physical condition exclusive to women, such restrictions discriminate on the basis of sex. The
courts held that medical leaves for pregnancy, like those for all other physical conditions, should
be determined individually based on a doctor’s evaluation. The selection of arbitrary dates has
no rational relationship to the performance of duties.

The arguments that have been successful in overturning these statutes, regulations and policies are:
that they are based on stereotypes that have no more place in our society than racial or religious
stereotypes; advance notice of when the woman plans to leave is as good as an arbitrary date to
allow provisions to be made for the person’s absence, and any emergency can be handled in the
same manner as emergency leaves not for pregnancy; There is as great if not greater continuity
when the leaves are not done by arbitrary dates; some of these provisions were based on outdated
concepts (children giggling at the sight of a pregnant teacher); administrative convenience or the
saving of money is not a defense when a constitutional right is in question. However, in the
Robinson case, the woman in the armed services, the court stated that a woman who was pregnant
and in the armed services could not be forced to resign, but could probably be transferred out of
a combat zone.

Most of these cases were based on the violation of the equal protection clause (some were based
also on the due process clause) of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. (The
Pennsylvania case (Cerra) used a state human rights statute and the armed services case (Robinson)
used the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment because it was a federal and not state
body being charged.)

When a person finds herself being affected by a mandatory pregnancy leave statute, regulation or
policy, she should take the following steps:
xy oe Continued on Page 7"
DoItNow,,,,7,DoItNow/DoitNowDec73_page007.txt,"1. Request that the mandatory leave not be enforced and provide evidence such as a letter  
from her doctor that she is physically capable of performing her duties until a given time.  
If there is a union, she should ask the union to assist her in challenging the pregnancy  
policy.

2. If the superiors do not answer right away or give a negative reply, she should file a  
complaint (or ask NOW or her union to file on her behalf) with the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission (E.E.O.C.) in her area and/or the State Fair Employment  
Agency, if one exists.

3. If the E.E.O.C. cannot settle the situation within 6 months, the woman, upon request,  
will be given leave to file suit in the Federal District Court. If her employer is a govern-  
ment body, she can file directly in Federal District Court without going through the  
E.E.O.C. or the state agency, challenging the policy on constitutional grounds.

4. The suit should be for reinstatement, back wages, any increase in salary which would  
have been forthcoming had the woman not been forced to take the pregnancy leave,  
any other damages incurred from the mandatory leave, court costs and lawyer’s fees  
and an injunction of any further enforcement of such mandatory pregnancy leaves.

JUDICIAL QUOTE OF THE MONTH:

‘The distinguishing factor seems to be motherhood versus fatherhood. The question then arises:  
Is this sex-related? To the simple query the answer is just as simple: Nobody — and this includes  
Judges, Solomonic or life-tenured — has yet seen a male mother. A mother, to oversimplify the  
simplest biology, must then be a woman.’ *** ‘Female employees are the only employees . . .  
who become pregnant; it follows that they are provisionally dismissed from work on account  

of their sex . . . '*** “To me, the discrimination is obvious.” Fourth Circuit Court of  
Appeals Judge Winter, dissenting in Cohen v. Chesterfield, (companion case in the Supreme  
Court to La Fleur).

DoItNow,,,,8,DoItNow/DoitNowDec73_page008.txt,"SOME USEFUL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE AMENDMENT

1. The Helms amendment completely ignores the U. N. Statement of Human Rights which
declares that it is a fundamental human right to be able to control the size and spacing of
one’s family; it further ignores the statement in American Jurisprudence which declares: if
the right to privacy means anything, it must include the fundamental right to decide whether
to bear or beget a child.

2. The Helms amendment seeks to impose a view on foreign countries which is neither held by a
majority in this country nor held constitutional by our nation’s highest judicial body, the U. S.
Supreme Court.

3. The Helms amendment further violates the sovereignty of other countries by ignoring the
fact that abortion is legal and included among the regular health services in many of those
countries which receive U. S. aid.

4. The Helms amendment ignores the basic health care needs of the women living in the less-
developed countries who rely quite heavily on abortion as a means of fertility control
because contraception and family planning services are not available.

See your chapter's Reproduction Task Force Coordinator for additional arguments. She should
have received them in a communication from the national coordinator by now.

THANKS FOR YOUR LETTERS

Thanks to all of you who are sending us the Congressional responses to your abortion letters.
We’re getting a dozen or more each day and we love it. But we still don’t have any letters from
these states: Pennsylvania, Vermont (don’t forget Senator Aiken is a member of the Joint Con-
ference Committee considering the Helms amendment), Maryland, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas,
Delaware, Hawaii, and Maine. Please get us those letters and keep them all coming! We've been
having quite a chuckle over some of the responses we have received. We're thinking of giving a
prize to the Member of Congress who can use the most words to say the least. It’ll be a rough
choice.

STUDENT MEMBERS OF NOW

The Legislative Office is again accepting interns for the 1974 winter semester.

Interns will be given an assignment in a specific area of the LO program and will work closely
with the Legislative Vice President and the LO staff. This semester one of our interns is work-
ing on abortion, another on desexing the Federal Code and another on the ERA.

Preference will be given to those students able to work full time for at least one semester. We
don’t pay anything and we can’t finance your travel to Washington, but we will pay local
transportation expenses.

CREDIT HEARINGS

By the time this newsletter reaches you, Sharyn Campbell, national Credit Task Force Co-
ordinator, will have testified for NOW on the subject of discrimination because of sex or
marital status in credit transactions and legislation needed to remedy it. The House Consumer
Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by Leonor Sullivan, invited Sharyn to testify at oversight
hearings on November 13, 1973.

CONTINUE TO WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE WITH YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
OF CREDIT DISCRIMINATION AND REQUEST HER/HIS SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION
THAT WILL END SUCH DISCRIMINATION. (NOW is not supporting any particular piece
of legislation on the House side at this time.)

PRAYERS IN CONGRESS

Coordinator of NOW’s National Task Force on Religion, Joyce Slayton Mitchell, did some
research on the number of women invited to offer the daily prayer in the House and in the
Senate, and has discovered that only five women have done so in the history of the nation.

About two times a month in the Senate and four times a month in the House, the Chaplains
step aside while someone invited by a Member of the respective house offers the invocation.
Perhaps your chapter can suggest names of women to invite to your Senators and Represen-
tatives."

CONGRATULATIONS!! AFL-CIO & NOW MEMBERS

On October 22, 1973 the AFL-CIO passed the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the tenth biennial convention of the AFL-CIO endorses the Equal Rights 
Amendment to the U. S. Constitution as precisely the kind of clear statement
of national commitment to the principle of the equality of the sexes under the
law that working women and their unions can use to advantage in their efforts
to eliminate employment discrimination against women, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: that state labor federations, in states which have not yet
ratified the ERA, urge their legislatures to act favorably .....

In a letter to George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO, NOW President Wilma Scott Heide and
Legislative Vice President Ann Scott wrote: “This is indeed a momentous day. (The) AFL-CIO’s
significant role in the democratization of the basic legal document of this land will be of historic
import; “As we have in other areas in the past, NOW looks forward to one more endeavor where
AFL-CIO will work with us in common cause for the completed ratification of the ERA. NOW’s
Legislative Office and the State Legislative ERA Coordinators will welcome cooperative arrangements
providing information to facilitate effecting speedy ERA ratification in at least a necessary eight of
the states where ratification has not yet been accomplished.”

The campaign for AFL-CIO endorsement was led by the women in the union movement and many of
the unions which had already endorsed. The AFL-CIO Constitution was also amended to read “To
encourage all workers without regard to race, creed, color, sex, national origin or ancestry to share
equally in the full benefits of union organization.”

Congratulations NOW members who lobbied so effectively for this tremendous endorsement. The
combination of the inside/outside alliance of women and men for ERA culminated in terrific victory!

ERA RATIFICATION COUNCIL RESOURCE CENTER

The ERA Ratification Council is composed of national organizations working for ERA. The Council
voted to establish a resource center to gather all materials on the ERA in one place, or at least a
reference card on each item. Common Cause offered to “house” the Center and provide some volun-
teers to help set it up. NOW Legislative Office has provided assistance in designing a cataloging system
which is complete with a cross reference. The cross reference will be able to indicate such things as:
Is there a study of sex discrimination in criminal law in Iowa? What kind of hearings were held in
New Mexico? N. H.? etc. NOW Legislative Office Intern, Connie Abrashoff (Trinity College) has
screened all our files and typed entry cards for the Center. An extra set of cards of our files will be
kept in our office. Upon request, the Center will answer inquiries and inform you of materials listed
in the Center and where you might obtain the material. The Center will not send materials or copies.
All member organizations of the Council will be able to make inquiries and to go to the Center to use
materials on file. This is a really big effort and every NOW member is needed to make it successful.
Please send us bibliographies of your personal collection — and, if possible, copies of your materials.
Connie will type entry cards and place them in the Center index. The Center plans to publish a
catalog of all entries. A notice will be placed in the Washington Blue Sheet when the catalog is com-
pleted and the Center is ready for use.

PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION, AND MATERIAL AS POSSIBLE. THE 2 YEARS
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ERA BEGINS TO LOOK SHORTER EVERY DAY AS
RATIFICATION COMES CLOSER. THIS CENTER WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO
VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION."

RESOLUTIONS FOR NATIONAL CONFERENCE

Proposed resolutions submitted by March 1 to Mary Lynn Myers, Coordinator of Resolutions Com-
mittee, will be summarized in a Conference Survival Manual. This manual will be sent to all pre-
registrants for the Conference.

You are encouraged to send proposals to relevant task force coordinators or chapters for their review
and support before sending them to Mary Lynn, since first priority will be given to Task Force/Chap-
ter resolutions, then regions and states.

Procedures for resolutions as voted by NOW’s Executive Committee indicated:

“It is recommended that all Chapters thoroughly discuss the resolutions prior to the
Conference so that members can come to reasoned decisions concerning them. In order

to deal with the press of events at the Convention, the resolutions committee is empowered
to bring to the Executive Committee guidelines for emergency resolutions. It is further
recommended that resolutions not only deal with how to change the centers of power in

this country, but also include how to implement these actions at the local level. If individuals
wish to have resolutions brought to the Convention, they may bring their resolutions to the
chapter or task force for consideration and adoption first.”

The National Planning Committee has further decided that the Conference will first deal with resolu-
tions submitted to Mary Lynn before March 1, and it will then consider those submitted to her before
May 1.

Resolutions are to be succinctly stated, or will be summarized by Mary Lynn.
Send resolutions before March 1 to: Mary Lynn Myers, 1312 East Church, Pierre, South Dakota 57501.

bers are appointed by the President with Board approval. Three are elected at the National

DoItNow,,,,5,DoItNow/DoitNowFeb74_page005.txt,"NOW POWER COMES TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY

In cooperation with National Compliance Task Force Coordinator Lynne Darcy and other NOW  
officers, Chicago NOW and Southwestern Pennsylvania NOW Chapters have initiated actions  
seeking to improve the status of women in the steel industry.

The actions followed closely press reports that the steel companies’ plans to correct job discrimina-  
tion within the industry did not include women. In discussions with the Justice Department,  
NOW Legal Vice President Judith Lonnquist was assured that the problems of women are and will  
be included in all negotiations with the steel industry.

“Since women are presently less than 5% of the workers in the steel industry, we are particularly  
concerned that the hiring goals for women at all job levels be set sufficiently high to redress this  
gross imbalance,” Ms. Lonnquist said. “We shall continue to watchdog the settlement and will not  
tolerate anything but the best possible pact. If the agreement is inadequate, we shall take what-  
ever steps we can to see that the rights of women are protected.”

Chicago NOW sponsored a public meeting in Gary, Indiana with women of United Steelworkers  
Local 1066 — “an important first step toward joint action of NOW and union women” (Chicago  
NOW newsletter, ACT NOW). The meeting, attended by many Chicago NOW members, National  
Board members Mary Jean Collins-Robson and Kathy Rand, as well as representatives of the EEOC,  
the Department of Defense, Gary Human Relations Commission, the Indiana Civil Rights Com-  
mission and the Wage and Hour Division, was highly successful. Over thirty union women of those  
in attendance responded to NOW’s call for a committee to take action on the job discrimination  
complaints aired at the meeting and to plan further actions.

Southwestern Pennsylvania NOW Chapters, in separate but related actions, have filed a complaint  
against U.S. Steel, following attempts at negotiation by the NOW Chapters.

In negotiation sessions, the Pennsylvania chapters report, officials of U.S. Steel stated that manage-  
ment policy is to award fringe benefits differentially on the basis of sex. When the NOW repre-  
sentatives pointed out that this is prohibited by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, one company  
officer said, “The law is absurd.”

“This is the third major challenge to established discrimination against women in Pittsburgh  
that NOW has initiated. The Pittsburgh Press and the University of Pittsburgh ultimately

Gardner, NOW Eastern Regional Co-Director, implying that the steel companies will also learn.

The Pennsylvania NOW members also met with officers of Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. with  
more positive results.

Both Chicago NOW and the Southwestern Pennsylvania NOW Chapters received excellent press

Associated Press articles with national circulation."

NOW LDEF PUBLIC SERVICE AD CAMPAIGN BREAKS $3 MILLION MARK!

NOW in its precedent and record-breaking seventh month, the NOW LDEF Public Service Ad  
Campaign has reached a media value of over 3 million dollars. The ads have appeared on  
some 249 radio stations in 48 states, 262 television stations in 47 states, approximately 36  
public broadcast stations and even the BBC.

Print ads have been published in many national magazines and other print media, with a value  
of almost $500,000. The magazines include Time, Newsweek, Saturday Review/World,  
Nation’s Business, MS., The New Yorker, Sports Illustrated and many others.

The response from the advertising world continues to be highly favorable as is the reaction  
from the general public. Letters still swamp the NOW LDEF Office in New York, reports

worked and lobbied hard for passage of the Human Rights Law (Title 34) of the District of

an end, in the District of Columbia, to discrimination for any reason other than that of individual  
merit, including, but not limited to discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, national origin,  
sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, family responsibilities, matricula-

ABORTION  
OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES  

The December 14, 1973 issue of “The Greene Sheet,” the National Right To Life Committee, Inc.  
newsletter, claims that three more Senators have announced their support for a “mandatory human  
life amendment.”  

The three Senators are: William Proxmire (D-Wis), Walter D. Huddleston (D-Ky), and  
Roman Hruska (R-Neb).  

TURNING THEM AROUND  

None of the three have publicized their support for a “mandatory human life amendment,” but we  
do believe “The Greene Sheet’s” claim that these Senators have promised some sort of support  

in response to constituent lobbying is a fact. However, none of the three are a lost cause for us  
and, in fact, prospects for turning them around are good if we put all of our efforts into it.  

Senator Huddleston has been supportive towards women’s rights in the past as a member of the  
Kentucky State Senate. Our feeling is that he is succumbing to the very intense pressure that  

the compulsory pregnancy people have put on him, such as the December 10th home office visit  

of a delegation of citizens and local officials. Senator Proxmire is known as a “liberal” in Congress.  
If we can flood their offices with mail, telegrams, and phone calls, we may be able to persuade  
them to support the Supreme Court decision. Likewise with Senator Hruska.  

ACTION  

IT IS URGENT THAT EVERY NOW MEMBER WRITE TO ALL THREE SENATORS IMMEDIATELY  
(GET A FRIEND TO WRITE TOO)! Don’t depend on a chapter letter to relieve you of the personal  
responsibility for writing, and don’t fail to write because you're not a constituent. We have the  

capacity to deliver over 50,000 strong if we each act. Sit down and write or telegraph today! AND  
SEND CARBONS OR OTHER COPIES TO YOUR OWN SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES  
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. See September Blue Sheet for suggestions on arguments to use.  

LONG-RANGE ACTION  

The National Reproduction Task Force Coordinator, Jan Liebman, and the Legislative Office are  
developing an abortion kit which will be mailed to your chapter’s Legislative Task Force Coordinator  
and Reproduction Task Force Coordinator in a series of updated installments.  

1. Make sure (a) your chapter has coordinators for these two task forces and (b) that their names  
are on the national task force mailing list (if not, have chapter president send postcard to National  
and to Legislative Offices).  

2. Make sure that your coordinators keep you informed with the most timely info possible. The  
best way is to join your local Legislative and/or Reproduction Task Force and work with your  
coordinators on a local level. Help set up an abortion telephone tree to alert members as fast as  
possible.  

3. Visit your Members of Congress whenever possible and be persistent. We cannot be shy and we  
cannot allow ourselves to be put off with evasive answers. The opposition doesn’t."
DoItNow,,,,9,DoItNow/DoitNowFeb74_page009.txt,"NONDISCRIMINATION IN LENDING — TWO VICTORIES  
Two victories for women, one legislative, one regulatory, occurred recently in the area of lending.  

SMALL BUSINESS ACT  

On January 2, 1974, President Nixon signed into law a bill to amend the Small Business Act which included the following amendment introduced by Congresswoman Lindy Boggs (D-La):  

“In carrying out the programs administered by the Small Business Adminis-  
tration, including its lending and guaranteeing functions, the Administrator  
shall not discriminate on the basis of sex or marital status against any person  
or small business concern applying for or receiving assistance from the  
Small Business Administration, and the Small Business Administration shall  
give special consideration to veterans of the Armed Forces of the United  
States and their survivors or dependents.”  

Okay, budding businesswomen, let’s use this opportunity to get started.  

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK BOARD  

On December 7, 1973, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board issued the following statement of  
the Board's policy regarding nondiscrimination in lending by Federal Home Loan Bank System  
member institutions:  

“The Civil Rights Act of 1968 does not specifically prohibit discrimination  
in lending on the basis of age, sex or marital status, and the Board’s regu-  
lations are at present limited to the scope of that Act. However, such  
discrimination is contrary to the principle of, and may in fact violate,  
Constitutional provisions which guarantee equal protection of the law  
for all persons. In addition, such practices impede the achievement of  
the objectives of Federal laws intended to promote sound, economical  
home financing, fair housing opportunity and a decent home for every  
American.”  

This statement will affect Savings and Loans, the largest lenders of mortgages in the United  
States. It is only a partial victory because, being a statement of policy, it does not have  
real “teeth” when it comes to enforcement. Federal legislation prohibiting discrimination  
in granting of credit on the basis of sex or marital status is still needed.  

NOW members who do experience discrimination in obtaining a mortgage from a Savings  
and Loan should write to the Federal Home Loan Board in their region, with a copy to  
the discriminating institution and another to the national Credit Task Force coordinator,  
Sharyn Campbell, c/o the Legislative Office.  

HEARINGS ON THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF WOMEN  

The Hearings on the Economic Problems of Women before the Joint Economic Committee  
chaired by Congresswoman Martha Griffiths (D-Mich) are now available. The hearings  
contain such information that your chapter may be able to use — especially if you're in  
an unratified ERA state. Request a copy of the three-volume publication from your own  
Senator or Representative."
DoItNow,,,,10,DoItNow/DoitNowFeb74_page010.txt,"ANTI—ERA ATTACK ON FCC PROJECT

The NOW broadcast media project to upgrade news coverage of feminist events and to improve  
the image of women in programming is being subjected to a vicious attack from the far right  
as a means to obtain radio and TV airtime to espouse anti-ERA views.

DETROIT AGREEMENT TARGETED

In August of 1973, Detroit NOW reached an open agreement with its local ABC-TV station,  
WXYZ, which provided for an affirmative action plan for women and for a small amount of  
feminist programming. This agreement was submitted by the station to the Federal Communi-  
cations Commission, as a part of the station’s official public file, and was approved by the FCC.  
On September 26, 1973, the so-called ‘Center for the Public Interest’ filed a complaint against  
the station, alleging that the agreement it had reached with NOW was secret and unlawful.  
NOW and WXYZ both filed a reply defending the agreement.

DIRECT MAIL CAMPAIGN

Subsequently, a direct mail campaign was launched by CPI to raise money to fund litigation  
against NOW’s broadcast media project. The letter, signed by Congressman Trent Lott (R-Miss)  
and sent out on Congressional stationery, accuses NOW of blackmail and other crimes. It is  
being used by anti-ERA groups in both ratified and unratified states to attack NOW and,  

more importantly, to gain access to radio and TV airtime to promote their views against the  
ERA.

THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE ERA

CPI is another typical far right wing front organization, whose Board is composed of known  
anti-ERA organization members. American Conservative Union, Human Events, Young  
Americans for Freedom, and of course Phyllis Schlafly are among those endorsing CPI’s  
anti-NOW program. Copies of its letter attacking NOW have turned up in Virginia, South  
Carolina, Montana and Florida so far. In Montana a state representative received a letter  

from a constituent alluding to NOW’s “secret activities.” He brought this to a NOW member’s  
attention who had the Legislative Office send him documentation refuting the charges. In  
Florida, Shirley Schellenberger of STOP ERA went on the air to tell about NOW’s “secret  
agreements” in Detroit. The station aired NOW’s rebuttal via a phone interview with Joan  
Israel, Detroit NOW President, who very convincingly refuted the charges.

ACTION

1. Call the NOW Legislative Office immediately if the Trent Lott letter is being publicized  
in your community, or if you learn that any of your local media have received any  
communications about the letter.

2. Your chapter president, Legislative and FCC coordinators will be receiving (in fact, may  
already have received) a packet of materials from the Legislative Office and the FCC Task  
Force which should be very useful in refuting this attack. Make sure your chapter has  
these before undertaking rebuttal.

3. If NOW is attacked on radio or TV, request that the station give your chapter airtime  
to defend NOW. If NOW is not attacked but the program espoused an anti-ERA point  
of view, you should request that the station air the opposing point of view.

POSITION AVAILABLE

A position is available for a Director of Legislation (lobbyist) in the Legislative Office, who  
will implement NOW’s legislative priorities. Salary is $13,200. Previous legislative experience  
desirable and membership in NOW (preferably of long duration) is required. Include in resume  
duration of membership in NOW, positions held in NOW, activities in NOW and membership in  
other feminist organizations. Also include education and relevant experience. A full position  
description will be sent upon submission of a resume."
DoItNow,,,,11,DoItNow/DoitNowFeb74_page011.txt,"NOW ERA TWO YEAR STRATEGY  
RAISING THE ISSUE  

Raising the Issue is the strategy NOW is using in primary/election politics for the ERA. NOW  
cannot endorse candidates because of our tax status. However, this strategy presents many  
ways and advantages for influencing elections by “issue” focus rather than “candidate” focus.  
The GOAL of the strategy is to influence all candidates to endorse the ERA. The TARGET  
selection is a “NO” district. That is, if there is an ERA voting record and the person holding  
the district seat voted “NO” you have a potential TARGET. Decisions on which districts  

to TARGET should be based on information from PAR: How close was the last election?  
How well organized is NOW in the district? What other groups that have endorsed the ERA  
are organized, or in large numbers in the district (i.e., especially labor)?  

HOW TO RAISE THE ISSUE: (1) Draw up a timeline like the one Chicago NOW has designed  
below; (2) Keep track of all candidate nights in the district and make certain NOW members  
attend and ask about the ERA; (3) Keep track of all TV talk show appearances, news interviews,  
etc. of the candidate and try to have the ERA listed as an issue to be presented to the candidates  
in each interview; (4) Each time a candidate endorses equal rights in any way, be sure to publicize  
their statements. A candidate may shift from total opposition to endorsing a State ERA —  

or supporting a state bill on equal credit; that is a wobble and indicates some change. Identify  
the “wobble” with growing awareness of inequality of women in law, and keep up pressure for  
full endorsement of ERA. If this candidate wins and still has not endorsed ERA, you can  

suggest win was result of “wobble” and continue to press for full endorsement. In other words,  
use the “wobble” as a save clause; (5) NOW can provide “voter information” concerning voting  
records on the ERA and public statements. Hand out sheets or small ads in suburban or rural  
weeklies, demanding “public accountability” of candidates on the ERA; (6) letter campaigns,  
telephone campaigns, door-to-door campaigns can be used to build grassroots support for the ERA  
and confront the candidates with constituency support; (7) Meet the candidates at their “shopping  
center” stops with placards — “Equal Rights by the 200th Anniversary of the Republic”, etc. —  
and possibly adopt a particular slogan or sign or other way of identification that is visible to the  
candidates, public and media (example: Florida met their “traveling” committee hearings at the  
airport with umbrellas painted with slogans).  

REMEMBER THAT THE GOAL OF THE STRATEGY IS TO HAVE ALL CANDIDATES ENDORSE  

THE ERA.

MONTHLY NEWSLETTER OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN

CALL TO NOW’S SEVENTH CONFERENCE

Dear Sisters and Brothers in NOW:

Would you believe, NOW’s 7th Conference scheduled for May 25, 26, 27, 1974 in Houston, Texas,
is only about five months hence? As inexorable as time itself is the Theme (so far) selected for the
Conference: YOU CAN’T STOP NOW! Yes, it does have meanings for NOW members and non-
(yet) members.

Conference purposes include inspiration and (re) dedication; education and skills; policy and
strategy; feminist forum — personal and political (personal is political and vice versa); evaluation.
Whatever else, the Conference is our periodic opportunity to get together, to affirm, confirm our
commitment to and development of feminism that is central to any humanism. It’s experience
and a process as well as ‘happening(s)’.

This Conference will have some innovations. As always, we will choose people for particular respon-
sibilities and opportunities, i.e. officers, other Board members and 3 of the 7 next nominating com-
mittee. Unlike some instances previously, at least two nominees for each job will be presented to
the Conference attendees by the Nominating Committee. Other candidates will be possible and
welcomed. Also, campaigning will be more open and guidelines will be more liberal to facilitate
knowing candidates and their platforms. (Nominating Committees developing these NOW and will
publish in DO IT NOW). We also anticipate information on How NOW Works (something con-
stantly evolving), a Conference ‘Survival’ booklet, and Resolution guidelines so we can resolve
relatively less and strategize more to move from institutionalized sexism to institutionalizing feminism.
Chapters will want to discuss any really new resolutions pre-Conference after familiarity with the
institutions and policy we already have in considerable areas.

Opportunities to showcase chapter achievements; to see/buy feminist products; to share our sister-
hood and brotherhood for personhood; to laugh and commiserate; to create NOW’s development
and our own; to celebrate our viability and know our rising expectations opens us to vulnerabilities;
all of these and more are part of a NOW conference. As the largest unequivocally feminist organiza-
tion in the world and a vanguard in the profound universal behavioral revolution in this rebirth of
feminism: YOU CAN’T STOP NOW! We will define and reassign power for Life. Come to Houston!

Warmly,

Wilma Scott Heide.

Wilma Scott Heide has named Mary Lynn Meyers to coordinate the Resolutions Committee for the  
1974 National Conference. Proposed resolutions from regions, states, chapters, etc. for consideration  
at the Conference should be sent to Mary Lynn Meyers, 1312 East Church, Pierre, S.D. 57501.

NOW Needs You! ... To Run For National Office and NOW’s Board of Directors

The Opportunity of a Lifetime is yours for the asking — 34 positions are open that offer the chance  
for national service to the feminist cause. The reward for serving is immeasurable personal growth,  
the knowledge that you are making herstory, and shaping the destiny of the largest and most powerful  
of the feminist organizations.

Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! The form for filing as a candidate for one of the nine officerships and 25 seats  
on the Board of Directors is now available by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Judith Meuli,  
Chair-One of the Nominating Committee, 1126 HiPoint St., Los Angeles, CA 90035 or to your Regional  
Director. This is also the form which regions, states, chapters or individuals should use to nominate  
candidates (with their advance consent) for these offices.

This year’s Nominating Committee is functioning differently. It proposes to bring in a slate of more  
than one candidate for each officer and to report all candidates legally eligible to run as officers and  
members of the Board. No one will be arbitrarily disqualified in advance unless they fail to meet basic  
requirements: paid membership in National NOW for 6 months in advance of the National Conference.  
To qualify to run for office you must be a paid member by Nov. 24, 1973.

According to our by-laws, candidates may be nominated by (1) the Nominating Committee (2) petition  
45 days in advance of Conference (3) from the floor. As you can see, the easiest, most equitable way,  
is through the Nominating Committee which has agreed to report all legally eligible nominees. So, to  
save last minute membership verification checks and to give all candidates equitable exposure, please  
file through the Nominating Committee.

At the December 1-2 Executive Committee meeting in Chicago, Jackie Frost, Southern Regional  
Director, introduced an idea for expanding NOW to reach the large numbers of women and men  
who, statistics show, approve of the goals of the women’s movement. “At our present rate of  
growth, we will continue to add thousands of members each year through the organizing efforts  
of State Coordinators and Regional Directors. There is a clear need for paid field organizers to do  
the work of expanding NOW on a full-time basis. The field organizers would have direct respon-  
sibility to the National Board or Executive Committee, would set goals for increasing chapter  
strength and membership, would ‘know their territory.’” The idea will be presented to the  
February National Board meeting. Your Regional Directors would like to have your suggestions  
and reactions to this idea. Please contact them soon!

FUNDRAISING IDEAS FROM GENE BOYER, FINANCE VICE PRESIDENT, NOW  

The month of February has several commemorative dates which make excellent occasions for  
staging fund-raising events:  

February 4, 1921 — Betty Friedan’s birthday  

February 15, 1820 — Susan B. Anthony’s birthday  

February 16, 1902 — Marian Anderson’s birthday  

February 22, 1892 — Edna St. Vincent Millay’s birthday  
(also the birthday of one G. Washington who may be known to some  
feminists)  

February 28, 1828 — Cynthia Leonard’s birthday (there’s one to look up!)  

Among the outstanding events held by NOW chapters for fund-raising purposes:  

— Luncheon honoring female legislators and other women in public life;  

— Testimonial dinner honoring early suffragists and/or current feminist notables;  

— Feminist art show and sale. (Both Dallas and Chicago chapters have recently held profitable  
art shows.)  

If needed — and if the chapter is willing to share proceeds — the National Treasury can make advance  
loans for working capital for innovative fund-raising events. Contact Finance Vice-President Gene  
Boyer, 218 Front St., Beaver Dam, Wisconsin 53916.

DoItNow,,,,8,DoItNow/DoitNowJan74_page008.txt,"REPORT ON BY-LAWS VOTE  
By Betty Newcomb, Coordinator, Mailed By-laws Ballot  

Your November issue of DO IT NOW contained the flash that both proposed National By-laws  
changes had failed. That neither received the 2/3 vote required by the National By-laws is shown  
in the detailed count below:  

Yes Votes No Votes Required Number Total  
for 2/3 Fewer Votes  
Than 2/3 Cast  
Delegate System 889 775 1110 221 1664  
Regional Elections 914 746 1106 192 1660  

A total of 1667 valid ballots were counted. (10 people voted on only one by-law). An additional  

120 ballots, declared invalid, were either unsigned, unidentifiable, or, when checked against the  
master membership list, were found to be cast by persons who had not paid their dues by July 31, ‘73.  
An additional 182 ballots were classified “challenged” for one of the following reasons: postmarked  
after 11/1/73, could not be found in the membership file, signatures were illegible with no other  
identifying marks. If all of the challenged ballots had been yea votes, both by-laws would still have  
failed because it would have been impossible for either by-law to receive the 2/3 yea vote necessary  
for a by-law change. If there had been any possibility that they might have affected the final vote,  
further efforts would have been made to validate the challenged ballots.  

The by-laws committee made absolutely every effort to run a fair, smooth, voting process. Inevitably,  
some problems arose. While the National By-laws do not require such, the committee worked out a  
plan to allow secret ballots. The original copy submitted to DO IT NOW describing the ground rules  
for the election, including provisions for a totally secret ballot, had already been submitted, when  
Jo Ann Gardner notified the committee that our system did not follow Roberts Rules of Order Re-  
vised (pp. 356-357), and that according to our National By-laws (Sect. 14) we had to follow Roberts  
Rules or the vote could be declared legally invalid. A hurried telephone conversation exchange  
followed between the three committee members, Eleanor Smeal in Pittsburgh, Judy Lonnquist in  
Chicago, and me in Muncie, Indiana. One alternative from Roberts Rules allowed for a secret ballot;  
another described the procedure that we agreed upon. We gave up the benefits of the secret ballot  
primarily for financial reasons. The weight of the DO IT NOW issue carrying the by-laws change,  
even using special lightweight paper, was at the limit of the 8¢ rate if we included the one standard  
envelope required by Roberts Rules for the non-secret ballot. The procedure allowing for a secret  
ballot would have required in addition to an intricate ballot folding procedure, inclusion of two  
standard sized envelopes. The additional cost to NOW for supplying 30,000 additional envelopes  
and 30,000 times an additional 8¢ postage rate would have been something over $2,500. We  
reluctantly agreed to go with the non-secret ballot.  

If any of you have not already surmised, the re-stickable address labels were not used, as originally  
planned. Among the amusing anecdotes we will remember are some of the comments many members  
made regarding the non-stickiness of the tapes. Most of them were truly restrained and polite —  
totally unlike the popularly held image of feminists. Thanks to all of you for your patience. We  
really tried to make it easier for you.  

All NOW members owe a special thanks to the many people who helped us in the ballot-counting  
process — a terribly tedious procedure of counting, recounting, validating envelopes against a  

master file, deciphering signatures, stapling envelopes to ballots — all done in a successful effort  

to prepare properly for anyone who wished to check the ballot-counting procedure.  

If any of you wonder why the hurry and last-minute decisions, I will accept responsibility. I was  
adamant that the by-laws be dealt with as soon as possible. The new by-laws committee had to know  
the status of those proposed changes in time to process necessary by-laws changes to be presented"
DoItNow,,,,9,DoItNow/DoitNowJan74_page009.txt,"at the 1974 National Conference.

Betty Newcomb, Coordinator,  
Mailed By-laws Ballot

Ballots cast on the By-law membership issue will be maintained in the NOW National Office for six  
months from the November 10 NOW Board meeting. After that time, they will be destroyed per  
instructions of the NOW Legal Vice President. Any concerns on the ballots should be directed to  
the NOW National Office, 5 South Wabash, Suite 1615, Chicago, Illinois 60603.

ATTENTION: NOW MEMBERS  
Plea For Input To By-Laws Committee

The by-laws committee will meet sometime in January to prepare proposed by-laws changes for the  
consideration of the 1974 National Conference. For many of you, by-laws might seem incomprehensible,  
dull, irrelevant, or a drag. But they are very important. An organization’s by-laws shape the  
organization — its base of power, its flexibility or rigidity, and its constituency — that is, the kind of  
member it will attract. The by-laws committee will attempt to formulate proposals most nearly reflecting the wishes of the members. Please write to me and tell your views on possible NOW structure.  
You may want to direct your comments to any or all of the following areas:

Who should set program and/or policy for NOW — the members, the chapters, the board (total board  
or the executive board), the president? What number of persons should serve on the board — minimum,  
maximum? Should the board be primarily administrative, interpreting NOW policy and servicing the  
membership, or should it set policy, provide a forum for dissent? Should all board members be elected,  
or should some be appointed to provide regional or minority representation? Should some board  
members be elected regionally? What proportion mix — elected, appointed, regional, at large? Should  
regionally elected board members be representational only or should they be regional directors?  
Should regional boards be established? If yes, what functions should they perform? Should board  
terms be staggered? Should limits be placed on number of consecutive terms allowed? Should the  
vice-presidents be elected by responsibility, i.e. legal, legislative; PR, fundraising? Should those  

four responsibilities be given executive board status? Should other responsibilities be given executive  
board status? What should be the relationship between member, chapter, state, region, national?

Should budget priorities be set by the national board, or by the membership? What function should  
be served by the National Conference — reaffirmation of sisterhood, program setting, policy-making,  
attracting media attention? Should the voting at the National Conference be by delegates? What  
representation mix? Should the mailed by-laws ballot be preserved? If you voted against either of  
the recent by-laws changes, please tell us why you voted against them, what features of the proposals  
you rejected?

I have tried to present a broad range of possibilities for comment. If your pet cause has been omitted,  
truly, it was not intentional. The only bias the by-laws committee has is to attempt to reflect the  
wishes of the membership. The list above is a long one. Long responses will be appreciated, but not  
expected; nor will neatness count in the amount of attention your reply receives. Please let us hear  
from you. We cannot reflect the wishes of the membership unless we know them. Wilma Scott Heide  
will officially appoint the members of the new by-laws committee soon. Please send your replies to  
reach me no later than the end of the first week in February, 1974, for consideration by the by-laws  
committee.

A Report from Joan Goldstein,  
National Coordinator, NOW Women & Health Task Force

The National Task Force on Health defined as one of our goals the humanizing of physician  
attitudes towards women. In response to this concern, the Baltimore NOW Health Task Force  
has developed a program concept which attempts to open communication and dialogue between  
women and women physicians. During this experimental evening of panel and discussions,  

150 Baltimore women, many of whom were not members of NOW, but may have been later,  
were finally allowed to ask basic questions and receive unhurried answers on the all too  
mysterious body. Learning was a two-way street: physicians were surprised to hear of women’s  
experience with the profession and to recognize how little is shared between doctor and patient.  
This seemed like only a beginning. Requests were made for continuous sessions on a variety  

of subjects.

In recognition of the enormous need for health dialogue, information and education, the  
Baltimore County NOW Health Task Force has put together a kit of a model program on  
women’s health to serve as a guide for groups nationally. I see this as one prototype of program  
activities which NOW chapters could adapt throughout the country. If there are other concepts,  
please contact me so that we can share our experiences. Here’s the information:

A Model program on women’s health: How to organize a panel discussion on  
“Women’s Right to Health: Phases of Her Life.” Packet contains complete  
information on how to plan and succeed, step-by-step in 8 weeks, in sponsoring  
a panel discussion by four women doctors for an audience of 150 persons on  

a low budget. Kit includes sample letters to doctors, sample program, informa-  
tion on contents of discussion, moderator’s role, publicity, budget, and refresh-  
ments. Send $2.50 to Baltimore County NOW Health Task Force, P.O. Box 21,  
Sunshine Avenue, Kingsville, Md. 21087.

Nina Tassi, the Health chairperson, an energetic and creative woman, wrote in a letter to me:  
“I have an idea that you would find Baltimore refreshing to the spirit.” I did.

U. S. Supreme Court Reverts to Stone Age on Women & Public Accommodations

On November 5, 1973, the U. S. Supreme Court voted 8 to 1 (Douglas dissenting) to leave standing  
a decision upholding the right of a New Orleans hotel to refuse to serve women in its men’s grill.  
National Board member, Karen DeCrow, says, “This is a shocking and insulting decision for  
women. As the NOW Public Accommodations Week coordinator in 1968, I was convinced that  

in 1973, this was no longer an issue for NOW, for the women’s movement. I was mistaken.  
Apparently, the Supreme Court of the United States does not feel convinced that women are  
members of the public.

I suggest that every person reading DO IT NOW write to at least one, if not all eight, of the  
Justices who voted against our right to enter a place of public accommodation and be served therein.  
This is an unusual action to take — writing the court — and I suggest we keep the letters calm,  
polite, and short..... just to let them know how humiliated we are because of this decision.”

By vote of NOW Board, NOW is a member of the Women’s Coalition for the Third Century (WCTC)  
(women includes men) whose goals include empowerment of women. WCTC was developed as a  
feminist alternative to the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission (ARBC). We found the  
ARBC undemocratic, commercial, undemographic, and politicized. We will relate to the ARBC in  
order to impact it to move feminist orientation but develop projects for support via the WCTC.  
NOW has been asked to develop a brochure for WCTC that will focus on what's happening via  
feminism, celebrate women’s culture (real and potential). Examples of happenings and projects:  
national TV special in prime time; mobile community museums and/or road shows; women’s  
actions vis a’ vis art, literature, films, religion, child care, corporate actions, etc. etc. NOW members

and deliver single red roses (to symbolize the fetus) to each Member of Congress.  

The “right-to-lifers” are building up momentum with their victories over the past year — victories  
attributable to a well-financed, high-pressure lobbying effort.  

ACTION  

It is urgent that we let Congress know that we feel just as strongly in favor of a woman’s right to  
choose as “r-t-l” does in opposition. VISIT YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THEIR HOME  
OFFICES WHILE THEY ARE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS — ESPECIALLY DURING THE  
WEEK OF JANUARY 14-18.  

NO ABORTIONS FOR THE POOR  

On November 30th, Senator James Buckley (R-NY) introduced an amendment to the Social Security  
Amendments of 1973 which prohibited use of Medicaid funds for performance of abortions. The  
amendment was accepted by Senator Russell Long and passed in the Senate by voice vote. Since the  
House bill did not contain the language, the SSA’s will go to a conference committee for final  
version. The conference committee will be composed of members of the Senate Finance and House  
Ways and Means Committee. Latest word as of December 21st was that hearings on the Buckley  
Amendment will take place in February. See your Chapter Legislative Coordinator for more details.  

Little by little, the so-called “right-to-life” forces are hacking away at the hard-fought right to  
control our own bodies we won through the January 1973 Supreme Court decision. By prohibiting  
public funds (Medicaid and foreign aid) and legal aid services to be used for abortions and by allowing  
hospitals to decide whether or not to perform abortions, the opposition may succeed in eliminating  
medically safe, legal abortions to the poor both in this country and abroad.  

ACTION  

The situation is critical. We cannot afford another “r-t-l” victory. EACH AND EVERY NOW  
MEMBER SHOULD WRITE TO SENATOR RUSSELL LONG (D-La., Chairman, Senate Finance  
Committee) AND TO REPRESENTATIVES WILBUR MILLS (D-Ark., Chairman, House Ways  
and Means Committee) AND AL ULLMAN (D-Oreg., next in line for Mills’ job) TO PROTEST  
THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST POOR WOMEN, THROUGH PROHIBITION OF FUNDS  
FOR ABORTION UNDER MEDICAID. SEND COPY TO YOUR OWN SENATORS AND

The Flexible Hours Employment Act (S 2022), a bill which would require that within 5 years of
enactment, 10% of the positions at each and all levels in all Executive Agencies of the Federal
Government be made available on a flexible hours basis has been introduced in the Senate by
John Tunney (D-CA). Bella Abzug (D-NY) has introduced a similar bill in the House (HR 9699).

Flexible hours is defined as part-time employment such as four hours per workday or one to four
days per week, etc. A flexible hours job is intended to be a permanent, responsible position with
standard civil service protections and prorated fringe benefits. Another section of the bill requires
the Secretary of Labor to promote expansion of flexible hours employment practices by all public
and private employers.

We feel the bill could especially benefit parents by making it possible for both to contribute to
the rearing of their children and to the income of the family.

POWELL HEARINGS — EEOC

On Wednesday, December 12th, NOW testified at the hearings on confirming John Powell as
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Testifying for NOW, Ann Scott
used the opportunity to question the criteria on which an EEOC Chairman is chosen. In light
of the Steelworkers’ case, she asked whether the EEOC would continue to take a hard stance
on back pay. She also questioned what Powell’s stance would be as EEOC Chairman on equal
pension benefits.

RAPE BILL

The Rape Bill, which we first reported on in November, has since been introduced in the House
by Congressman John Heinz (D-Pa) where it has 37 House co-sponsors. The Legislative Office
has sent a letter to members of the House asking for support and co-sponsorship of the bill
(HR 11520). We urge you to do likewise with your own Representative.

The bill has 17 Senate co-sponsors, 6 of whom are on the Labor and Public Welfare Committee
which must act on the bill before it goes to the floor. The following members of the Com-

mittee had not co-sponsored at the time of this writing (December 6th): Dominick (R-Colo),
Eagleton (D-Mo), Hathaway (D-Me), Javits (R-NY), Nelson (D-Wisc), Pell (D-RI), Schweiker (R-Pa),

John Meuser presented “A Man’s View of Women’s Liberation” as part of Charlotte NOW’s “You’re On” program in October. In part he said: Men should support feminism, because feminism supports them.  

It is a movement for men’s liberation as well as women’s liberation. For example, as long as job discrimination against women is allowed to persist, a man will continue to find himself the principal wage earner of the family and will be forced to work until retirement simply because he has greater earning power than his spouse. If the salaries for men and women were equitable, a couple able to live on one income could share the burden of family support — each taking time off to pursue other activities.

CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING THE ERA  

“The National Board of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious took a stand on the ERA at their February meeting. With only one dissent, the Major Superiors who come from 15 different sections of the country favor the passage of the amendment. Sr. Margaret Brennan, IHM, President of the Conference, said that the board members had studied the question and were aware of some of the problems that might arise and also some of the fears that have been generated in connection with the amendment. ‘We need to address ourselves to those problems and fears as they arise, but not at the expense of the passage of such a good and important thing as the ERA,” Sr. Margaret commented. She added that Catholic women face a huge education task in regard to this amendment.” The following statement concerning ERA was issued by 18 members of the National Board of LCWR: ‘We believe in the equal rights of women because we believe in the equal rights of persons. We stand for concomitant safeguards against any interpretation of the Equal Rights Amendment that would be destructive of persons’ from press release of February 23, 1973. Other Catholic organizations which have endorsed the ERA are: St. Joan’s Alliance, National Coalition of American Nuns, and NETWORK.  

THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH ENDORSES THE ERA  

“The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) endorsed today the Equal Rights Amendment and called for increased participation of women in their own ranks. The resolutions were passed by more than 5,000 delegates to the church’s Third General Assembly, October 31, 1973."

TO 1974 NOW NATIONAL CONFERENCE ATTENDEES:  

The phenomenal growth of NOW in recent years has been exciting. The prospect of a national  
conference with over 3500 feminists in attendance is exhilarating. For conference coordinators,  
however, planning the conference can be quite a challenge.  

Our growth is a source of pride and strength; it is also the basis of tremendous logistical prob-  
lems. NOW is BIG — too big to be housed in a single hotel — too big to meet in plenary in a  
hotel ballroom — too big to leave the success of our conference to the mercy of last minute  
decisions.  

The headquarters for our conference will be the Rice Hotel in Houston, Texas. Everyone, how-  
ever, cannot sleep there. (The hotel’s not little — we’re BIG.) Overflow housing in other hotels  
is necessary. Whether you stay in the Rice or elsewhere depends on how soon you make your  
room reservations. First come — first served may not be a principle of natural law, but it seems  
the fairest method, and it’s the rule we'll observe.  

Workshops will be conducted in the Rice and plenary sessions in the Albert Thomas Convention  
Center three blocks away. (The hotel ballroom is not small — we're BIG.) We must get from  
one place to the other somehow, so walking is indicated. (Transportation will be provided for  
persons with physical handicaps.) Wear comfortable shoes, pray for sunshine, and bring an  
umbrella anyway.  

Child care, as usual, will be provided. To assure quality care for your children, and to facilitate  
planning which can make the conference memorable for the boys and girls who attend, you  
must pre-register for child care. We're too big to guess at the number of children to expect.  
Work must be contracted for and extensive arrangements made. So bring your children but  
please let us know how many.  

Your comfort, your convenience, your full enjoyment of an exciting weekend are our primary  
goals. Help us make this conference not just bigger, but better. We need your understanding  
and your cooperation. We pledge you ours. Don’t delay on your registration and hotel reserva-  
tions. DO IT NOW!  

See you in Houston,

NOW RAPE TASK FORCE COORDINATOR MARY ANN LARGEN REVEALS FACTS ON RAPE

“A Report on Rape in the Suburbs,” recently produced by Mary Ann Largen and members of the  
Northern Virginia NOW Chapter, counters the myth that rape occurs mainly in urban high-crime  
areas. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, forcible and attempted rape was up 18% in  
suburban areas as compared to a 9% increase in large cities in 1972. Northern Virginia, the area  
studied for the report, is typical of such suburban areas and is geographically located in the South,  
which is second only to the Western States in rate of rape per population. For further information  
on this new report, contact Mary Ann Largen, National Coordinator, Rape Task Force, 5203

NOW WAS FIRST TO URGE APPOINTMENT OF A WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT

While the news of Spiro Agnew’s resignation was still causing shock waves throughout the country,  
NOW’s message to the President was already on the news wires, closely followed by letters from  
Wilma Scott Heide to all members of Congress, Congresswomen and Women in the Federal Govern-  
ment, and a telegram to President Nixon. NOW’s statement, drafted by National Board member  
and Politics Task Force Chairperson Karen DeCrow, read:

“At this unprecedented time in U.S. history, it is time for another unprecedented event. The  

National Organization for Women strongly urges President Nixon to appoint and the Congress to

At the Western Regional Conference held in Las Vegas September 29 and 30, Patsy G. Fulcher of
Oakland, California was unanimously elected to head the thirteen-state region. A member of the California
Board of NOW and co-coordinator with Aileen Hernandez and Eleanor Spikes of NOW’s Task Force on
Minority Women and Women’s Rights, Ms. Fulcher succeeds Betty Kersh and Nancy Filler of Washington
as the West’s representative on the NOW National Board of Directors. She is also a co-founder of the
San Francisco Bay Area’s Black Women Organized for Action. Elaine Mills of Las Vegas was elected Assistant
Director for the Western Region.

Eastern Regional Co-Director Frances Kolb reports, “From September to November, the Eastern
Region was the scene of many exciting NOW meetings. States and State Coordinators gathered to view
their past with pride for the many achievements, with dismay for the jobs yet undone, and to view the
future with hope and an increased vigor to continue our many accomplishments.” Following such conferences
as the New Jersey “Our Minds, Our Bodies,” and the New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut
State Conferences, the Eastern Regional Directors, Jo Ann Evans Gardner and Frances Arick Kolb will host
a meeting of old and new State Coordinators in Newark, N. J.

Southern Regional Director Jackie Frost relays reports from the active Southern Region:

Orlando NOW plans to rent a 20-foot space and erect an open tent in which NOW artists and craftspeople
can display and sell their work on consignment. “Fiesta in the Park” takes place at Lake Eola on

Senator Omer Hirst chaired a long day of hearings September 18 in Richmond for the joint subcommittee
and the task force appointed to study “the extent to which the ratification of the ERA would
change the laws of the Commonwealth or Federal law as it relates to Virginians.” Phyllis Schlafly again
honored Virginia with her presence, and seemed to be getting the lion’s share of the press coverage. But
Virginia Beach NOW member Vera Henderson out-Schlaflyed Schlafly with a well-delivered presentation
just before lunch; when last seen, she was being interviewed before the TV cameras.

Witnesses FOR the Amendment included NOW members Flora Crater, Sandra Combs, Marguerite
Rawalt, Debbie Howard, Caruthers Berger, Kay Brooks, Lydia Howard and Elise Heinz. Combs, a
Vietnam veteran ex-captain in the Air Force, described the advantages of military service for women, and
her experience in a combat zone.

Tampa NOW will stage a “Barefoot and Pregnant Ball” to give away awards to people who have done
the most to “keep women in their place.” Five awards will be given at the November 2 ball, covering city,
county, state, national and international figures.

The Columbia, S. C. Chapter of NOW has filed charges of sex discrimination against Governor John West
and the State of South Carolina with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A study by the
Bureau of Urban and Regional Affairs reveals that women fill almost half of the State’s positions, but receive
less than a third of the pay. The as yet unreleased study by the Commission on the Status of Women provides
even more proof of the State’s blatant discrimination. Most black women are employed in positions ranked
as 01, white women in grade 05 and white men in grade 11. Also, the state insurance plan allows coverage
for any illness of an unmarried man, while unmarried women are not covered for pregnancy. Women must
be on the job one year before they qualify for maternity leave. No other illness or disability has such a
requirement. Prime movers for the suit were Vicki Eslinger and Marie Jakubs.

VETERAN'S BENEFITS AND THE SUPREME COURT  
FRONTIERO v. RICHARDSON  
93 S. Ct. 1764 (May, 1973).  

The Frontiero case arose when Sharon Frontiero, an officer in the Air Force, sought increased quarter allowances and  
medical and dental benefits to cover her husband. Frontiero claimed her husband as a dependent under the statutes providing  
for such increased benefits for spouses.  

These fringe benefits were instituted for members of the uniformed services in an attempt to attract career personnel.  
The statutes covering these benefit allocations provide that the dependent of a male member of the uniformed services  
is his wife; a female member, however, is allowed to claim her husband as a dependent only if “he is in fact dependent  
on the member... for over one-half of his support...""  

On the basis of this clause, Frontiero and her husband were denied benefits. They brought suit, claiming that such a  
statutory difference in treatment creates an unconstitutional discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of the  
5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  

The essence of their argument to the Court was that the 5th Amendment, though it does not specifically allow for  
equal protection, does forbid discrimination so unjustifiable as to deny one due process of law. The Frontieros’ contention  
was that if she were a male officer, the benefits would be granted her without regard to the actual financial dependency  
of her spouse, and that solely because she is a woman she has been denied those benefits. This, the Frontieros claim, is  
an unjustifiable statutory classification.  

They argued that classifications based upon sex, in the same manner as those based upon race, religion and national  
origin, are inherently suspect and should be subjected to close judicial investigation.  

The Supreme Court, in agreeing with the Frontieros, based the weight of its decision upon its earlier decision in  
Reed v. Reed (1971), where the Court ruled unconstitutional an Idaho statute providing if there are two individuals  
otherwise equally entitled to be the administrator of an estate, and one of the individuals was female, the male must be  
awarded the appointment.  

The Court had reasoned in Reed, as it did in Frontiero, that sex classifications were as suspect as those based on race,  
national origin and religion. The argument used in Reed which the Court chose to extend in Frontiero was that a legislature  
cannot make classifications based on arbitrary distinctions, solely for the purpose of legislative convenience (the argument  
of the defense had been that the sexual classifications were included in the statute merely to alleviate administrative paper-  
work by narrowing one class of people eligible). The Court determined the test of the arbitrariness to be that the classifi-  
cation distinction must bear a legitimate relationship to the governmental interest sought to be protected. In other words,  
the Court decided that legislative convenience, in and of itself, is not a factor which will support the constitutional  
validity of a statutory classification. If the classification is found to be patently arbitrary in relation to the objective  
of the statute, it must be found unconstitutional.  

In Frontiero, the Court reasoned that a sexual classification was in no way shown to have any correlation to the granting  
of benefits to service people and their spouses in order to increase career personnel, other than to save administrative  
cost and time.  

It is important to note, and the Court in both Reed and Frontiero was careful to point out, that it is not necessary that  
the statute in question deny women all rights under its provisions in order for it to be found that the statutory classifica-  
tions are discriminatory. More specifically, the fact that women were not automatically denied benefits (Frontiero’s  
husband would have been eligible for benefits if he had been found to be dependent) did not enter as a factor in the  
Court's determination that because Frontiero was denied employment benefits under different regulations from those  
applicable to her male peers, the statute was discriminatory.  

Justice Brennan, writing the majority opinion in Frontiero, looked back with considerable regret on the sexist history  
of the Court and noted that the courts have come a long way from the judicial sexism found in cases such as Bradwell v.  
Illinois (1873), where the Court concluded that:  

The harmony * * * which belongs * * * to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman  
adopting a distinct and independent career from that of her husband. * * * The paramount destiny and  
mission of woman are to fulfill the offices * * * of wife and mother * * * .”  

With the backdrop of that quotation, the Supreme Court ventured again, not only to concur with its decision in Reed,  
but to expand it. The position of the Court articulated in Frontiero now seems to be only that it is a denial of a woman’s  
right to equal protection under the law to be denied a statutory privilege because she is a woman, but that any statute  
which makes a classification distinction based on sex is inherently suspect and should be held to close judicial scrutiny.  
Thus, Frontiero holds that the imposition upon a citizen of a disability based on that person’s sex on its face is a denial  
of rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Judith Lonnquist  

JUDICIAL QUOTE OF THE MONTH:  
“* * * it can hardly be doubted that, in part because of the high visibility of the sex characteristic, women still face  
pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, on the job market and perhaps  
most conspicuously in the political arena * * * women are vastly underrepresented in this Nation’s decision-making councils.  
There has never been a female President, nor a female member of this Court * * * ."" (U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brennan  
in Frontiero)."
DoItNow,,,,5,DoItNow/DoitNowNov73_page005.txt,"NEWS FROM THE NOW LEGAL DEFENSE & EDUCATION FUND

The NOW Legal Defense & Education Fund’s Board of Trustees, at the Summer 1973 meeting, approved Fund participation in eight cases. Two cases, Aiello v. Hansen and Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board; LaFleur v. Cleveland Board of Education, challenge discriminatory employment practices in regard to maternity. In Rosemary Smith v. Jerome R. Lewis, an attorney is being charged with malpractice for failing to include a wife’s interest in community property in a settlement agreement. The Fund is also taking an interest in two Title VII suits, one involving a female teacher at a university, and the other challenging the state overtime pay provision for being limited to women.

The additional cases involve a married woman’s right to retain her birth name and a suit against a doctor who performed an abortion on a minor.

If you are employed by the Xerox Corporation and wish to work for women’s rights, you might be able to do so and get paid by Xerox.

The NOW Legal Defense & Education Fund office is in need of people to work in the headquarters office, but is unable to provide for a full, salaried staff. Under the Xerox Social Service Leave Program, an employee may apply to work for programs such as the NLDEF for up to one year. If approved she/he may receive regular salary from Xerox and retain benefits and seniority.

The NLDEF particularly needs people with ability in law, budgeting and programming, project management or public relations. Any Xerox employee who is interested in working for the Fund under this program should write to the NLDEF headquarters office at 641 Lexington Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10022, describing skills and experience and what she/he would like to do for the Fund.

DETROIT NOW CHALLENGES TV LICENSE RENEWAL AMIDST ATTACK BY ANTI-FEMINISTS

In two moves related to TV license renewals, Detroit NOW, in coalition with other Detroit area groups, settled successfully with WXYZ-TV and petitioned the FCC against WJBK-TV. The settlement with WXYZ, now under attack from HOW and Stop ERA members, provides for improvements in the employment of women, prime-time programming directed at feminist issues and goals, and a Women’s Advisory Council for the station.

(NOTE: The September DO IT NOW reported Women & Health Task Force Coordinator Joan Goldstein’s participation in the University of Michigan’s Conference on Aging. According to additional information received later, Detroit NOW President Joan Israel and Lillian Troll were instrumental in establishing the feminist focus of that conference. Detroit NOW Member Harriet Alpern was a member of a workshop panel on the media. NOW President Heide was a featured speaker.)

ATTENTION NOW CHAPTER FUNDRAISERS AND ALL NOW MEMBERS

Kathy Olson, Vice President of Twin Cities (Minn.) NOW, sends the following caveat: ‘The soon-available 1974 Liberated Woman's Appointment Calendar has a poem entitled ‘Indian Giver’ opposite the September 15 entry. In deference to the personhood of all our Original/Native American sisters and brothers, please look opposite this entry BEFORE you make a decision about purchasing this calendar.’

A note from the authors, Lynn Sherr and Jurate Kazickas: (from their reply to Kathy Olson) — “We in no way wish to slight Native Americans by reprinting the poem, ‘Indian Giver,’ by Diane Wakoski. To us, it was a feminist poem, a particular part of the woman’s experience, told in the idiom of schoolchildren. In fact, that is the only reason why the term ‘Indian Giver’ was acceptable to us. We probably don’t need to point out to you our deep concern for Native Americans, as evidenced in some of our other entries. We fully acknowledge our commitment to feminist and humanist goals. As we wrote in the introduction, we hope the day will come when we won’t need publications like ours to understand — and sometimes even laugh at — some of our worst problems.”

DALLAS AND FT. WORTH NOW CHAPTERS JOIN TO CHALLENGE NEW AIRPORT

At the dedication of the new Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport, women guests including Women State Senators and Representatives were invited only to a fashion show while men attended a political luncheon. Attendees at the fashion show were greeted by the NOW members with flyers pointing out the obvious discrimination: “The Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport is designed to take us into the 21st Century, so let’s put 19th Century ideas behind us.”

INTERNATIONAL NOW CHAPTERS ARE THE GOAL OF WORLD TOUR

National Board Member Patricia Burnett, representing the NOW International Committee, is traveling to 14 countries, including the USSR, to study the status of women in those countries, and to discuss the establishment of NOW chapters throughout the world. Ms. Burnett will meet with many feminist and world leaders, including Indira Gandhi. For the two-week visit to Russia, Ms. Burnett is the guest of the Soviet government, along with Frances Farenthold, Claire Harvey and Carol Pendell."
DoItNow,,,,6,DoItNow/DoitNowNov73_page006.txt,"FROM THE PRESIDENT:

1. Apparently resulting from my protests last year to Psychosurgery funding by the National Institute of
Mental Health, N. I. M. H., of the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, H. E. W., I was invited to
be a member of a consultant panel convened by N. I. M. H., 9/24/73. The issues are: no empirical evidence of
therapeutic effectiveness of psychosurgery (brain surgery); therefore it is human experimentation; denial of civil
liberties and civil rights of subjects who are often in no position to give ‘informed consent’; use of powerless
people — women, children, prison inmates, hospital inmates as subjects; criteria of mental health has documented
double standards that, for example, considers return/adjustment to ‘housewife’ (sic, no one marries a house) role
as success vis-à-vis women victims. N. I. M. H. knows my views and recommendations as a behavioral scientist,
as a NOW officer, as a civil libertarian citizen. If you are knowledgeable about this phenomenon, please write
Dr. Bert Brown, Director, National Institute of Mental Health, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20852. Suggest
you insist on no public funding of Psychosurgery research, experimentation, subject selection, procedures without
additional continuous feminist consulting and monitoring. Communicate with Joan Goldstein, NOW Task Force
Coordinator on Women and Health for follow-up on these actions: E-14 Lakeview Terrace, Princeton, N. J. 08540,
(609) 452-1796.

2. Suggest each NOW member ‘recover’ at least one former NOW member who may have simply neglected to
renew, would like to know current exciting programs and progress, whose reason(s) for not renewing no longer
exist.

3. As long as I have breath and voice in NOW, I shall continue to observe, until the phenomena are eliminated,
that concepts, language and behavior that communicate: target, fight, enemy, barricades, ‘give ‘em hell’, male
chauvinist pig ~ m.c.p., etc. sound like the military, masculine mystique that is all too ‘Pentagonian’ and the
central ethos of our culture. I am as radical (getting to root causes), unequivocal, committed, vigorously feminist
as any other NOW member or other feminist; however, adversarial concepts, behavior and language are root causes
of the basic human inequality of sexism that feminism intends to cure. Alternatives to the above in sequence
might be: focus, work, beneficiary (though recalcitrants won't view or feel it that way just NOW), barriers, give
‘em heaven (again, some don’t know it yet), still normal male, i.e. sexist, etc. Indeed, the rebirth of feminism
means, in my view, that SHE IS RISEN to redefine and reassign power for life. May I suggest this be discussed/
considered in our chapters, in our homes, in the private lives of our minds.

4. NOW Executive Committee, who has responsibility for NOW conference has tentatively selected a catchy
theme for the May 1974 conference of: ‘You Can’t Stop NOW’. NOW Conference Planning Committee, delegated
Conference Planning Opportunities by Executive Committee solicits Conference theme and program ideas from
NOW membership. Committee please note another theme suggestion of: ‘NOW, She is Risen’. Stating ‘She’
does not exclude men. The ‘She’ only means that women are being empowered and that we: women, men and
children recognize the value of the so-called ‘feminine’ part of human potential for women and men publicly
and privately.

5. On the subject of men in NOW: All NOW publications, newsletters, communications, conference invitations,
must, according to our statement of purpose and incorporation, include reference to women and men, sisters and
brothers, girls and boys.

6. Finally, a problem and opportunity for all of us active in and for NOW: correspondence. Most received by
me from other NOW members is truly beautiful in content, style, brilliance, effectiveness, and sentiment. It is
also near overwhelming, coupled with other mail and responsibilities. However, please keep it coming and please
continue with your understanding that it is shared, acknowledged, answered, acted upon by: letter, phone,
word of mouth, actions, speeches, conferences, as much as energy, time and judgment can create. It is never
ignored. Criticism/advice are at least as valued as commendations. All are cherished by me as sources of thought,
inspiration, aspiration and vitalization best articulated as your expressions of caring. May God, (that is, the divine
in us all) guide us to create a world where the power of love exceeds the love of power. Onward!

In life and love, Wilma Scott Heide

AFL-CIO 10th NATIONAL CONVENTION, MIAMI, FLORIDA, OCTOBER 18-20.  

Realizing that the press deadline for DO IT NOW is October 5th, we hope that you will  

already know of the AFL-CIO Convention and that we have been working for an ERA  

endorsement. As of October 5th, it looks good for a reversal by the AFL-CIO, one of the  

largest organized groups still opposing the ERA. Paul Jennings, President, I. U. E., has  

announced he will introduce a Resolution on the floor for endorsing the ERA. NOW  

strategy to swing labor around seems to have been very effective in two ways: 1. the raising  

of the names and activities of the opposition and their traditional anti-labor views and votes.  

2. the raising of the issue of “protective labor laws” which are either being extended to  

men and/or women as a benefit or struck down as prohibitive under Title VII. The Legis-  

lative Office has prepared an ERA LABOR KIT which was mailed October 5th to the  

Legislative Task Force, Union Task Force, Board, ERA Coordinators. Included is a list of  

Pro ERA Organizations, Anti ERA Organizations with notation of the Anti groups that  

support “right to work” legislation; information on “protective laws” and what’s happening;  

a page of quotes from opposition..... including the latest from Robert Welch, founder  

JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY in the July, 1973 Bulletin: ‘Fortunately, such patriotic and out-  

standing women as Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly and Mrs. Jacquie Davidson had been sounding the  

alarm in a vigorous though losing campaign,” he says, explaining, “they did not have behind them  

any organization with the cohesiveness and experience and leadership drive which the Birch mem-  
bership could supply. Welch claims that as a result of the subsequent Birch involvement, the  

ERA was stymied. (Quoted from HOMEFRONT, August, 1973)"

DoItNow,,,,11,DoItNow/DoitNowNov73_page011.txt,"NOW’S LEGISLATIVE ACTION HANDBOOK

{Last month installment no. 1 on Lobbying as a chapter action started our handbook. From time
to time new installments will appear in the Blue Sheet.)

Preparing Testimony

Sooner or later you may want to testify before your city council or a committee of your state
legislature on a bill of interest to NOW, or, if you have a special expertise, we may ask you to
prepare testimony and/or to testify for NOW before a congressional committee.

a. Ask to testify: Write or call the city council or the state committee which has jurisdiction
over the bill, find out if and when hearings are being held (if they’re not, you may want to
push for them), and ask to testify. Ask them to send you a copy of the bill. If you can’t
make the hearing or can’t get someone to present the testimony for you, ask to submit
written testimony for the record.

b. Form: Type clearly, double space. Provide enough copies for the entire committee and
the press (usually about forty). Get the testimony in, if possible, two days ahead, so the
committee members can read it. Use offset or instant printing for good reproduction.
Have a front page that says something like this:

Testimony on the Welfare Amendments Act of 1972 (S. 1234) presented

before the Poverty Committee of the Legislature of the State of California,

by Jane Equal on behalf of the National Organization for Women, June, 1972.
In your first paragraph, identify yourself by name and occupation and residence. State
that you are appearing only for NOW, and describe NOW briefly (i.e.):

The National Organization for Women was formed in 1966 for the purpose

of bringing women into full participation in the mainstream of American

life in truly equal partnership with men. With a membership of both men

and women, NOW is the largest feminist organization in the world, with

over 600 chapters, and with members in every state.

c. Content: Start out by stating NOW’s official position on the issue from our Bill of Rights
or from our resolutions taken at our national conferences. Don’t make your testimony
over 4 or 5 pages unless you have very complex, subtle, and relevant arguments. Don’t
cover the whole feminist movement — no legislature is quite ready for that — but just the
information, arguments and statistics that have direct bearing on the bill. Document
your research by citing the source in the text or in footnotes. You can append single
copies of documentation (tables, articles, letters, graphs) for inclusion in the record that
you may want to refer to but not read. Don’t be afraid of making a joke or a forceful
statement, or of using a good quotation. Stick to a few well-documented points rather
than scattering your shots. Make your strongest statements first before they fall asleep
and wind up with a succinct summary and a bit of wit if you can. (The NOW Legislative
Office can provide some model testimony if you write, or you can look in the hearings
record on the ERA).

d. Questioning: You may be cross-questioned. Take your time. If you are asked a legal or
statistical question you can’t answer, don’t bluff. Say frankly you don’t have that

RAPE CENTER BILL  

On September 13, Senator Mathias (R-Md.) introduced S. 2422, a bill which would establish a National  
Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape. Senator Mathias’ office worked closely with the NOW  
Legislative Office and with Mary Ann Largen, NOW’s National Rape Task Force Coordinator, in the  
drafting and tactics on the bill.  

BACKGROUND  

Written as an amendment to the National Mental Health Act, S. 2422 would, among other things:  

1. Authorize and fund study into the effectiveness of state rape laws, attitudes toward  
rape, treatment of victims, causes, motivations of rapists, impact on families, homo-  
sexual rape in prisons, effectiveness of existing programs. The wording of this section  
is careful to make organizations such as NOW eligible for grants in the event the bill  
is passed and funded.  

2. Act as a clearinghouse to compile continuing studies, conduct research and demon-  
stration projects and training programs for police and medical personnel, etc.  

3. Set a funding level of $10,000,000.  

NOW’S CONTRIBUTION  

NOW’s most important contribution to the bill was to advise the language defining rape, for the  
purposes of the bill, as “forcible, statutory, and attempted rape, homosexual assaults, and other  
criminal sexual assaults.” The usual legal definition of rape in the states’ laws is limited to “vaginal  
penetration” by a man against a woman’s will, and therefore does not include such acts as forcible  
anal or oral copulation, or use of an instrument. Our language would materially broaden the scope  
of the bill, and hopefully encourage adoption of a broader definition of rape at the state level.  
Crimes other than “vaginal penetration” are usually considered “sodomy,” and receive a lesser  
punishment.  

TACTICS  

NOW and Senator Mathias hope to get this bill through the Senate before the Christmas recess.  
Please write both your Senators urging them to co-sponsor, not just support, S. 2422.  

NOTICE TO ALL NOW CHAPTER PRESIDENTS  

Please send by postcard the name, address, business and home phone number of your chapter's  
Legislative Task Force Coordinator to BOTH the Legislative Office and the National Office.  

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CHAPTERS BE REPRESENTED ON THE LEGISLATIVE TASK  
FORCE. Your Legislative Task Force Coordinator will be your only chapter member to receive  
emergency Legislative Alerts directly from the Legislative Office. She/he in turn is responsible  

for keeping you informed.  

Also, please let the Legislative Office know the name of your Congressperson so we can get some  
effective spot lobbying going."

As of this writing, the Right-to-Lifers and some church groups were again attacking abortion  
with a vengeance — this time through the “MAUDE” TV series and CBS Television.  

Background: Over 20 stations throughout the country refused to broadcast the repeat of the  
two-part MAUDE program on abortion scheduled for August 14 & 21. The stations included:  
WWL, New Orleans; WMBD, Peoria, Illinois; WISM, Milwaukee; WNAC, Austin, Texas;  
KXJB, Fargo, N. D.; WSBT, South Bend, Indiana; WTEN, Albany, N. Y.  

As of August 14, two sponsors had withdrawn from the program, with pressure from right-to  
life groups cited as the cause.  

According to NOW President Wilma Scott Heide:  

“BUT NOW CAN PRESSURE TOO. Anti-abortion groups have no patent on  
letter-writing.  
NOW MEMBERS ARE URGED TO WRITE TO THESE SPONSORS TO

YOU ARE NOW’S LOBBYIST: LOBBYING AS A CHAPTER ACTION PROGRAM

This is the month your chapter will probably be deciding on its program for the year. It is vitally

important that lobbying your Congresspersons be a part of that program. The lobbying that
really counts is the lobbying that you and your chapter do at and from home — not only indivi-
dually through letters and calls to your legislators’ offices, but as a chapter by meeting with
them at home. Our efforts in Washington depend on you.

What follows is a suggested program for your chapter to lobby your Representative. You may

want to adapt it for your state legislators also, with help from your State Legislative Coordinator,

who may also be arranging for meetings with your Senators. (We are grateful to the State
Legislative Coordinators from California — Geri Sherwood, Michigan — and Illinois for some
of the materials used here.)

This kind of lobbying is not only what makes our efforts possible in Washington, but is the kind
of service your chapter can and should provide for its members and prospective members.

PLANNING THE MEETING

Pre-planning the meeting makes for the best results. As a chapter, decide what the goals are
for your meeting (opening up communications with your Representative’s office, getting a
commitment to oppose the abortion amendment and discharge petition, supporting credit
legislation, childcare, etc. — your chapter legislative coordinator and other task force coordina-
tors will have materials from their task forces). Plan for several of you to go — four or five at
the most — your Legislative Task Force person, President, relevant Task Force Coordinators
might be your choices. Decide on what points you want to cover — probably no more than
three — and divide up the topics so that one person leads the discussion on each point. Get to-
gether or prepare materials on each point. If you are nervous, role-play the meeting before
you go, trying to anticipate questions or objections to your program your Representative may
have. (She/he may surprise you and be very receptive!) Try to have someone in your group
of the same political party as your Representative.

ARRANGE THE MEETING  
Call or write your Representative’s home office, explain who you are, and that you want to

have a meeting next time she/he is in town. List the topics you want to cover and who will be
attending from the chapter, and what their chapter functions are."
DoItNow,,,,4,DoItNow/DoitNowSept73_page004.txt,"THE MEETING

1. *Take some literature with you: NOW’s Bill of Rights (especially), NOW’s goals, position papers on dope sheets from the National Task Forces on Issues of interest to you, a sample of your chapter newsletter or publication.

2. *Tell a little about your chapter — what its priorities are, its successes, mention briefly your newsletter and your speaker’s bureau so they know you get to a lot of people. Don’t say how large or how small your chapter or NOW is — instead stress our importance as opinion-makers.

3. *Limit your presentation to probably no more than three points, but make them good and forceful. Make sure they are all things on which federal action is required. Decide ahead what points you want to cover, and what your goals are for the meeting (opening up communications with their offices, getting a yes on extension of minimum wage or childcare, etc.) If there are several of you, divide up the topics so a different person leads the discussion on each point. [Speak for the Chapter or for NOW (Our chapter’s priorities are... NOW’s legislative program calls for . . . )]

4. *Ask their offices to do something for you — keep your chapter informed or provided with copies of bills, send your legislative task force person the Congressional Record. Ask to be placed on their mailing list for the newsletters they send to their home district.

5. “Let them know what you can do for them — support them on bills, ask if you can arrange for them to speak at a chapter meeting or rally when they're home (be sure you get a good turnout), mention anything good they've done in the chapter newsletter, get them information they could use on bills they want to introduce and support or put in the Congressional Record, etc.

FOLLOW-UP

Write a letter when you get home summarizing the points of the discussion and thanking them for meeting with you. Let them know your chapter will keep in touch.

* * * * *

The most effective way to lobby is to be informed, brief and efficient. Your Representative will not agree with you on everything, but remember that in lobbying today’s enemy is tomorrow’s friend. If you can’t get to them on this issue, you may get to them on the next. Confrontation is a tactic among other tactics — use it only when it may pay off for you, and only when you have carefully planned for it.

Task Force on Reproduction & Its Control  
Jan Liebman, Coordinator  

P. O. Box 40542  

Palisades Station  

Washington, D. C. 20016  

(This local action is outlined for the 30 ratified states. Members in the 20 unratified states will  
want to concentrate efforts on the E. R. A. and not confuse the two issues. The opposition  
is trying to connect them to defeat the E. R. A.)  

STATUS REPORT ON ABORTION  

The last two Do It Now Blue Sheets have contained information on the Constitutional Amend-  
ment on Abortion from the Reproduction Task Force and the Legislative Office. The newest  
developments concern who will control the hearing process in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  
Senator James Eastland (D-Miss.) has recently decided to co-sponsor the Buckley Constitutional  
Amendment to guarantee the Right-To-Life of the fetus. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary  
Committee, Senator Eastland could use his power to take hearing authority on the Constitutional  
Amendment away from Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.). (He has already bypassed Senator Bayh  
by holding hearings on the Constitutional Amendment on Busing.) Senator Bayh states that his  
mail is running very pro-amendment at this time and that other Senators are beginning to exper-  
ience pressure also.  

PURPOSES AND FOCUS:  

This local action outline has a target: we want our Congresspersons to oppose the Constitutional  
Amendments on Abortion and support the Supreme Court decision. Always keep that target in  
sight! NOW chapters should engage in as much local lobbying at the home offices of Senators  
and Congresspersons as is possible. We also need to identify and develop the strong community  
support of individuals and groups outside NOW for the Supreme Court decision on abortion.  
Remember, the opposition intends to do the same thing!  

TACTICS  

The opposition will be using all the emotionalism they can muster from the very beginning,  
through color slide shows, color picture books, and pickled fetuses. NOW should begin our  
present campaign by giving legal, rational arguments against the Amendment. All NOW educa-  
tional efforts — speeches, television appearances, flyers — should have the goals of generating  
mail to Senators and Congresspersons which demonstrates that community support exists for  
the Supreme Court Decision and against the Constitutional Amendment. Take stationery and  
stamps with you to meetings and get people to write on the spot!"

Primary watches — The opposition has claimed they will challenge pro-Supreme Court  
decision Senators and Congresspersons in the primaries. The Legislative office will need  
solid information on where abortion becomes a hot primary issue and the results.  

LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:  

(Because feminist arguments against the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit  
abortion are often ineffective, it is important that we learn to use a broad range of reasons  
for opposition. The following are some suggestions which you might find helpful; learn  
to use them!)  

1. CONSTITUTIONAL PURITY  

Don’t junk up the Constitution — technology could make the abortion issue obsolete —  
opens the door to busing and school prayer amendments — establishes an absolute in  
a fluid, pluralistic society.  

A"
DoItNow,,,,7,DoItNow/DoitNowSept73_page007.txt,". PRACTICAL PROBLEMS (PROHIBITION AGAIN?)

Will not prevent abortions — past laws, no matter how strict, have not prevented abortion —  
will generate lawlessness, black market increase — increase organized crime involvement.

. CRIMINAL LAW:

Abortion will be prosecuted as murder although never considered as such even under the  
strictest laws in the past.

Actions resulting in miscarriage would be considered a crime possibly resulting in a charge  
of manslaughter.

No pregnant woman could be jailed in the absence of a reason to jail the “fetus person.”  
A woman who took a drug for illness or for her health which inadvertently resulted in a  
spontaneous abortion could be charged with murder.

. TAXES

Would the fetus be counted as a dependent for tax purposes — from the moment of conception?  
How far could and would the IRS go to verify the pregnancy? Would Medicaid be available to  
fetuses? And Child-Welfare support?

. IMMIGRATION:

What would be the citizenship status of a fetus?

Could the fetus be a person and not a citizen? Would all children conceived by alien persons  
in the U.S. be citizens? Could a pregnant woman who is not a citizen be deported when she is  
“carrying a fetus citizen?”

. CHILD NEGLECT:

Could the state force the mother to comply with certain standards of care and activity for the  
protection of the fetus?

Could a pregnant woman be prosecuted if she smokes since this causes lower birth weight?  
Could drug-addicted women be prosecuted for more serious crimes — such as for pushing —  
due to addiction of the fetus to drugs?

- PRIVACY:

What would become of a woman’s right to privacy as the state expanded its efforts to protect  
the constitutional rights of the fetus? Would pregnancies have to be registered from the moment  
of conception?

Could state police be assigned as guardians to the fetus to ensure its well-being at all times?

The arguments are many and can be used effectively in discussing this issue with the neutral or  
uncommitted men who are lawyers, doctors, Senators, and Representatives. Good luck in putting  
them to use. Remember preservation of the right to choose is in our hands.

MARYLAND STATE ERA  

Maryland voters approved a State ERA by Referendum in May 1972. The State ERA  
went into effect July 1972. The State Legislature re-convened in January 1973.  

SENATOR STEERS (voted Federal ERA) went through the Maryland Code with a computer  
and simply pulled out those sections of the law which referred to sex in any way. His  
strategy was to merely change the language throughout the entire code. In some areas this  
formula worked rather well, in others — notably domestic law — this method proved to be  
disastrous, resulting in anything but equality.  

The Steers Bills caused quite an uproar and immediately, everyone concerned began  
looking for other ways of implementation of the ERA.  

1) Delegate Charles Blumenthal, who had previously sponsored the ERA ratification  
in the House, came up with a resolution to give the Attorney General power of  
declaratory judgment over the ERA. For various reasons, such as slowness,  
inconsistency, and the basic illegality of such a resolution, NOW and other groups  
opposed this method. The resolution was killed in committee.  

2) The Women’s Law Center (Baltimore) and the Maryland State Commission on the  
Status of Women screened the “Steers Bills.” The Bills were separated into three  
categories: good, recommended; mediocre, not recommended; hopelessly  
inadequate, not recommended. NOW adopted these recommendations and with  
the coordination of Casey Hughes, State Coordinator, Sylvia Wright, State Legis-  
lative Coordinator, and Ellen Luff, NOW member and attorney. Basically  
speaking the goals were accomplished in regard to these bills.  

3) Maryland NOW reports that actually most legislators were anxious to support  
good legislation, but the Steers Steamroller caused considerable confusion and  
tempers grew short on all sides. The solution to this quagmire was to call a halt  
to legislation implementation and provide for a Governor’s Commission to study  
and recommend legislation for the January 1974 session.  

LEGISLATIVE OFFICE STATE ERA IMPLEMENTATION FILES  

The NOW Legislative Office is currently designing a file system to incorporate State ERA  
action on implementation. This file will provide information on studies, action, persons  
involved with State ERA implementation. Please forward all information to the Legislative  
Office concerning your state. Ratification of the ERA is NOW’s priority! However, politics  
does not work in a vacuum as illustrated by the Maryland Case described above. The Phyllis  
Schlafley Report/May listed a “horror” story on Maryland. This has been mailed by the  
Anti’s to all state legislators in Indiana and Louisiana. The Report listed 17 “horror” bills —  
only one of those listed actually passed (and that was one on protective legislation).  

With this information we will be able to act as a referral service for NOW members and coordi-  
nators lobbying for implementation. According to our information, the Maryland Governor’s  
Commission for implementation is the first of its kind. This may be helpful to other states  
planning implementation. Contact Maryland State Coordinator for more information:

POLITICAL ACTION RESEARCH (P A R) is the first phase of NOW’s 2-Year ERA Strategy.

It is a lobbying tool for political analysis of all legislators in unratified states, carried out by
NOW members in the legislators’ districts. It comes in the form of a pamphlet to be filled out
with information that will make effective lobbying possible: who legislators’ campaign con-
tributors are, what organizations they belong to, issues they ran on, etc. Copies of the pamphlet
will be kept on file in the Chapter, the State Legislative Coordinator, and in the Legislative
Office. NOW will have the most complete files anywhere of those 20 states.

We plan to adapt this program for the other 30 states and for Congress as soon as humanly
possible.

DoItNow,,,,10,DoItNow/DoitNowSept73_page010.txt,"MINIMUM WAGE BILL

BACKGROUND: As you know, the Minimum Wage Bill is NOW’s top Federal priority legislation this year.  
*The Bill has been passed by both houses,  
“has gone through Joint Conference,  
“came out with everything in it we wanted,  
(especially coverage of domestic workers)  
*and is now ready to go to the President for signing.  

All during the House and Senate debate, however, there were intimations from Republican leaders that the bill would be vetoed by the President as inflationary. That, of course, is  

a terrible irony. As Senators pointed out during the debate, inflation has so increased prices that a worker would have to earn $2.16 an hour right now to buy what he or she was able to buy for the $1.60 an hour minimum Congress approved in 1966 and that has been unchanged since then. What’s more, the $2.20 an hour minimum doesn’t even go into effect immediately. It will take till 1975 before all the non-farm workers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act reach $2.50. Farm workers won't get there until 1976.  

THE BILL WILL BE SENT TO THE PRESIDENT AFTER AUGUST 25TH IN ORDER TO PREVENT A “POCKET VETO” WHILE CONGRESS IS IN RECESS. IF THE PRESIDENT SHOULD VETO THE BILL WHEN HE GETS IT, CONGRESS WILL BE BACK SEPT. 5TH AND WILL TRY TO OVERRIDE THE VETO — SOMETHING THAT HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE THIS SESSION — SO FAR!  

*ACTION - WRITE, WIRE YOUR CONGRESSPERSON AND SENATOR, URGING OVERRIDE IF A VETO OCCURS!!!  

LABOR — HEW VETO THREAT — Coalition for Human Needs and Budget Priorities  

BACKGROUND: Confrontation over national spending priorities between the Congress and the President grows closer as the Senate puts the finishing touches on the Labor-Health, Education & Welfare Appropriation. At stake are numerous human needs programs that the Administration slated for demise in its FY 74 Budget Message.  

*******If the President chooses to veto the Labor-HEW package, as expected, the stage will be set for an effort to OVERRIDE THE VETO, which has only happened once so far!  

The House approved a Labor-HEW Appropriation package on June 26 that is squarely out of the range of Administration expectation — $1.25 billion over Mr. Nixon’s request. Included in the increase is funding for such programs as education for disadvantaged children, hospital construction and modernization, OEO Community Action Agencies, and Legal Service and Senior Citizens Programs, Regional Medical Programs and others — all programs the President wanted to eliminate or reduce in scope. The Senate is currently holding hearings and will finish work  

on the bill in early September. Early speculation is that it will increase funding for these programs — putting the entire Congress squarely on the line against the President.  

Mr. Nixon has repeatedly threatened to veto any bill he considers ‘fiscally irresponsible’. The HEW bill fits his definition. We can therefore expect a veto of the Labor-HEW bill in mid-September, after the Senate and House complete their conference report.  

“IN THE EVENT OF A VETO, WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND BOTH SENATORS URGING AN OVERRIDE. WE MUST HAVE IT TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY’S PRIORITIES FROM MILITARY TO THE MUCH NEEDED DOMESTIC PROGRAMS!"

PRESIDENT’S COMMENTS  

“If you/your chapter want to work on the Bicentennial: NOW found the AMERICAN REVOLUTION BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION to be undemocratic, political, commercial and anti-feminist; so we have joined others to form the independent WOMEN’S COALITION FOR THE THIRD CENTURY. Exciting projects related to our past, the present and our future will be in the works and await your creation. The goal is the empowerment of women.” NOW President Heide is on the steering committee. Chair-One is Reverend Patricia Budd Kepler (NOW member). Contact her at the Harvard Divinity School, 45 Francis Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

Dr. George Wiley, National Coordinator of the MOVEMENT FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE and former Executive Director of the NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, drowned on August 8. Our nation has lost a champion of justice. In memory of George and to modestly aid our common cause, NOW President Heide contributed $25 to support the movement Dr. Wiley was creating. Address: 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

I am not an  

feel complete and |  
For various reasons, however, I never had  

the opportunity to be really physical around  

men during the first twenty years of my life.  

I watched them win their letters - first  

with admiration, then disgust, then bemuse-  

ment. I worked at a camp where the boys  

took longer and more arduous canoe trips,  

but I was always content with our placid  

pace, pleased enough to be out in the wild  

on my own.  
My contact and awareness began innocently  

enough. My college roommates and I decided  

we wanted to run on the indoor track at the  

male-inhabited stadium before breakfast.  

Then we wanted to play squash in the after-  

noons. And then we entered a beginner's  

squash tournament and beat some fellow male  

classmates. Such athletic competition and  

sweaty glory against men is one thing in  
square white  

ag  
courts with controlled light  

and heat; perhaps to a tradi- | i  

tional physical education department - }  

but inconsequential in a more fundamental i  

sense. i  
As I began to camp and backpack alongside | |  

men during my wilderness summers, a whole  

new dimension of my existence as a physical  

woman came into focus. In a life where phy-  

sical strength and stamina became as essen-  
tial to everyday survival as good judgment  
and a quick mind, most female sexual stero-  
types came cascading down.  

Concern over appearance became absurd;  
striving for a clean body and a head of hair  
were challenging enough when lakes still  
supported ice floes. Clothing became asex-  
ual. Everyone packed identical weights.  
People cooked for their friends. Those who  
had talent provided fish for supper. Mas-  
culine/feminine roles seemed only another  
artificiality of civilization that I was glad  
to leave behind, totally and forever, I  
thought at the time.  

I felt free to be dirty, to sweat, to  
strain to my physical limits and then enjoy  
the day-end exhaustion. It felt good to be  
primitive. I never had the sensation of  
being particularly organic or close to Mother  
Earth, but in retrospect, I guess our life  
did exist in such dimensions.  
Even that life, however, was somewhat  
transitory and escapist. When I began this  
summer, however, to work as a professional  
instructor alongside men, my confidence fal-  
tered for the first time. No longer was I  
merely enjoying the wilderness, but along  
with three men I assumed responsibility  
for the safety and well-being of 26 students  
for five weeks of instruction and backpack-  
ing in the rugged Wind River mountains of  
Wyoming. We had all received similar train-  
ing as instructors, yet it was obvious from  
the start that I was unequal. I soon came  
to agree, but that acceptance of self was  
difficult to achieve, even among men who  
obviously could not be terribly chauvinistic.  

I could read a map, catch fish, and do  
nearly everything as well as the other three  
instructors--except be as strong. I chose  
to not chew tobacco, but then so did they,  

Becky and Trick Knees  

When a girl collapsed of heat exhaustion,  
Dave carried her pack on top of his, while  
I coaxed her along, walking slowly and sev-  
eral hours behind. When a boy got sick, I  
was the one to fix tea and honey and sit up  
half the night by the fire forcing energy  
into his system. When another student seem-  
ed to have appendicitis, it was men who con-  
trolled and executed the evacuation proce-  
dures, while women stayed behind and quite  
literally kept the home fires burning. These

for the '73 racing season.  

‘A weekly race for members is  
being considered, plus Special  
Women on Wheels shows. Three  
events have already been  
booked for '73.  

This being the third year  
for some of the members, it  
was discussed having two  
classes in '73. One division  
for non-experienced members,  
basically street stock class  
with safety features only per-

for experienced drivers will  
feature a modified class.  
Rules for the modified class

Greenboro Motor Speedway Inc.,

the Archdiocesan Council of  
Catholic Women has launched  
a statewide attack on the  
proposed amendment. Unless  
they feel feminist pressure,  
many legislators will show  
their respect for Catholi-  
cism's political clout (and  
their yen for R.C. votes) by  
voting ""no"" on the ERA.  
Please don't give the Cath-  
olic Church a chance to kill  
this amendment. Urge your  
readers to deluge their con-  
gressmen and legislators  
with pro-twenty-seventh a-  
mendment letters. Thank you  
very much. May ""Gold Flow-

PEOPLE'S COMPANY"
GoldFlower,1,11,january 1973,4,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol1No11_page004.txt,"A Rape Crisis Center has opened  
in Minneapolis to aid victims  
of the ""nation's least reported  
violent crime against a person,""  
according to Rita Gallagher of  
the Center.  

Headquartered in the Women's  

Counselling Service, the Rape  
Crisis Center will operate 24  
hours a day from the phone num-  
ber 824-RAPE.  

STOP  
RAPE  

Another rape center was opened  
last month by a group of south  
Minneapolis churches. But ""they  
will just offer counselling for  
a short time,"" says Kathy Mc-  
Connell of the Crisis Center.  
""We will offer both immediate  
counselling and carry through the  
entire medical and legal pro-  
cess.""  

""When a rape victim calls in,""  
Ms. McConnell says, “a volunteer  

will talk to her, give immediate  
counselling and determine if she  
needs transportation to safety or  
to a hospital. Volunteers will  
also see that the medical exam is  
correct, both medically and leg-  
ally.""  

In addition, volunteers will  
assist the victim in pressing  
charges against her assailant, as  
well as offering pertinent infor-  
mation and personal counselling.  
Self-defense classes and a speak-  
er's bureau will also be part of  
the Rape Crisis Center's program.  

“Women should be aware that no  
local hospital considers rape an  
emergency situation,"" Ms. Gallag-  
her explains. ""And women don't  
realize that the hospital is part  
of the legal process. In Minnea-  
polis, they'll check for traces  
of sperm to prove rape. The wo-  
man's body is checked for bruises,  
scratches and signs of assault,  
which are sometimes photographed.""  

The Rape Crisis Center will  
provide referrals to selected  
physicians. “Few physicians will  
take rape cases because of the  
possibility of court testimony,”  
Ms. Gallagher points out.  

Statistics indicate that the in-  
cidence of this crime is rising,  
Ms. Gallagher says. ""A woman is  
raped every 14 minutes. There have  
been 340,270 reported rapes in the  
U.S. since 1970--and that doesn't  
include attempts. And it is es-  
timated that ten times as many  
rapes occur as are reported.""  

As for the legal aspects of the  
crime, Ms. Gallagher indicates,  
""Women don't realize that they're  
just a piece of evidence in the  
case, a material witness for the  
prosecution."" Rape Crisis Center  
volunteers will provide victims  
with necessary information about  
the legal process as well as ac-  
companying the women through the  
courts.  

“Women's traditional attitude is  
that when you're raped, there's  
nothing you can do,"" Ms. McCon-  
nell says. ""We are trying to  
change that.""  

Trick Knees, (Continued from page 1)  

were not always easy tasks for a supposed  
feminist.  

For my job status did depend on how well I  
executed my tasks, and there were several  
times that, with good judgment but a begrud-  
ging sense of resignation, I was forced to  
give over tasks and responsibilities to men.  
At the same time, there were really no tasks  
that I performed that one of the male in-  
structors could not have done as well. It  
was simply, and in the most primitive sense  
possible, division of labor according to  
ability, which, in extreme cases of emer-  
gency and exertion, was of necessity measur-  
ed in highly physical terms.  

Beating a man in a game of squash is satis-  
fying, mainly because you are still playing  
and struggling with society's rules and pre-  
conceptions. Arguing with a man at a party  
can be satisfying because you are standing  
on nearly equal ground. But finding your-  
self in a position where you must be treated  
differently because you no longer have the  
equalizing benefits of intelligence and so-  
ciety at your side is a difficult situation  
for contemporary men and women to handle  
without a certain degree of patronization.  
Even having a close relationship with a man  
in the city is far different than thirty  
miles back in the hills. There, you are  
both nearer to the fundamental differences  
between the sexes, yet, at the same time,  
you are freer and farther removed from so-  
ciety's crippling perversion of these physi-  
cally-based differences.  

When I returned to the city this fall, I  
talked to a very physically active friend of  
mine about these realizations of the summer. —  
She understood immediately and said how glad  
she has been, in a way, to have had a trick  
knee most of her life. How much that freed  
her from any ultimate physical activity, how  
much easier it was to rely on a trick knee  
instead of having to admit to no longer hav-  
ing the strength or stamina to continue. I  
envied her, yet it also made me mad.  

For it is yet another aspect of society  
that makes physical women ashamed when they  
can no longer compete with men because of  
basic biological differences. It is just as  
important for a girl at camp to discover she  
can portage a canoe over a mile of twisty  
trails as it is for her to realize that a  
man can do it faster - and that she should  
let him do it in certain situations with no  
remorse or loss of self-worth.  

Society has done much toward the libera-  
tion of females, but it has also insulated  
them against a more fundamental and total  
acceptance of their physical selves in rela-  
tion to men and the tasks and crises of the  
physical world. A lack of this knowledge  
and/or experience results not only in a cri-  
tical naivete about the world and society,  
but hampers a full healthy contact with our-  
selves and our bodies.  

We will not all turn to organic farming  
and living off the land in our lifetimes. We  

may never suffer the horrors of war or flood,  

or disaster. Few of us will ever experience  
the frustration of female athletes competing  
in a world of male-dominated Olympics and  
record books.  

But we must, nevertheless, slowly begin to  
accept our bodies and their physical limita-  
tions, with or without trick knees, as sepa-  
rate from our feminist liberation. As a re-  
sult, women will end up feeling as strong  

and independent as ever, but simultaneously  

feeling free of the need to make apologies  
in whatever encounters they may have with  
the physical lives and abilities of the men  
with whom they work and live."
GoldFlower,1,11,january 1973,5,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol1No11_page005.txt,"ERA Passes House, Faces Senate--

Will Bill’s Fate Affect Future Women’s Lobbying?

by Mary Hastings

The Minnesota House of  
Representatives passed the  
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)  
by a vote of 106 to 24 Jan-  
uary 17.

The Amendment, which en-  
countered heated opposition,  
may face even stronger re-  
sistance in the State Sen-  
ate. Sen. Jack Davies (L,  
Dist. 60), has scheduled a  
hearing on the Amendment  
before the Senate Judiciary  
Committee January 23. Dav-  
ies has the option of set-  
ting as many hearings on the  
Measure as he deems necess-  
ary.

The ERA states: ""Equality  
of rights under the law  
shall not be denied or abri-  
dged by the United States,  
or any State, on account of  
sex.""

The measure must be rati-  
fied by 38 states; at pre-  
sent 22 states have ratified.  

ERA is vital to women's  
progress toward economic and  
social freedom. But the bill  
is only the first--and  
seemingly ""non-controversi-  
al""--step in that direction.  
Nonetheless, ERA has elicit-  
ed emotional opposition from  

People’s Food System  
(Good Food Cheap)  

such groups as Happiness of  
Women (HOW), The American  
Legion, The John Birch Soc-  
iety, The Ramsey County Re-  
publican Women's Association  
and The Minnesota T-Party.

It is doubtful that the  
wildly irresponsible charges  
of anti-ERA forces will de-  
feat the bill in the State  
Senate. However, the oppo-  
sition may produce an un-  
desirable effect in our leg-  
islators and women fighting  
for ERA. If an ERA victory  
is hard-won, legislators may  
feel smug about their polit-  
ical ""morality"" in support-  
ing a ""controversial"" mea-  
sure. And women may exhaust  
themselves in the fight for  
ERA and retire from the field  
with little desire to reded-  

icate themselves to the nec-  
essary work that must be  

done to pass an abortion re-  
peal bill, comprehensive  
child-care legislation and  
welfare reform measures.

Local Women's Movement  
groups have dedicated them-  
selves to passage of the  
ERA. The Coalition to Rat-  
ify the ERA has placed eff-  
ective lobbyists at the State  
Legislature.

Gold Flower, a monthly Twin  
Cities women's publication, is  
named for a Chinese peasant wo-  
man whose life typifies the stru-  
ggles of many women. While in  
early life, she flaunted conven-  
tion by loving the man of her  
choice, Gold Flower later accept-  
ed an arranged marriage, in  
which she lived miserably. Fin-  
ally, banding together with other  
village women, she achieved a  

personal liberation during the

Minnesota Women's Political  
Caucus (MWPC), predicts that  
ERA will pass the State Sen-  
ate but may face stronger  

opposition than in the House.  

Dieterich noted that the  
MWPC will also dedicate lob-  
bying efforts to the passage  
of an effective child care  
bill this Session. MWPC  
will work with The Child-  
ren's Lobby and the Coali-  
tion for Comprehensive Child  
Care in this effort.

The 1971 Legislature app-  
ropriated $250,000 for The  
Child Care Facilities Act.  
Dieterich explained that the  
appropriation should be in-  
creased, but the Governor  
hasn't asked for an increase  
in his budget message.

Dieterich said that  
$700,000 would be a ""reason-  
able figure"".

""I think the vi a alia  
request will pass,"" she  
added. But the possibility  
of an increased appropria-  
tion is uncertain.

She added that MWPC will  
cooperate in supporting an  
abortion bill later in the  
legislative session.

writing  

BY PAT MONAGHAN  

""There's almost nothing you  
can do by yourself to fight man-  
agement,"" Frances Boelter main-  
tains. ""Women have to take a  
united stand.""  

Ms. Boelter, a personnel ad-  
ministrator at the federal De-  
partment of Housing and Urban  
Development (HUD), is one of  
several women who will speak at  
the Women's Employment Workshop  
this month.  

""The most important thing is  
to organize, then to document  

your efforts,"" the employment  

specialist claims. ""Management  
has almost no recourse when pre-  
sented with official documenta-  
tion. Words and promises don't  
mean anything—it has to be in  
writing.""  

Four employment specialists  
will define women's working rights  
at a midday workshop Jan. 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center, 24  
West 31st Street.  

Sponsored by Model City Women's  
Task Force, the information ses-  
sion is ""designed to get women  
to realize how to make the laws  
work for them,"" says Frankle  
Quade, Model City staffer. ""It's  
a practical workshop on how to  
make ‘affirmative action' work.  

""A lot of women,"" Ms. Quade  
continues, ""are not even aware of  
what the words ‘affirmative act-  
ion’ mean. When I first read the  
laws I was amazed at the rights  
women do have.""  

Registration begins at 9:30  
a.m. for the session, with the  
program beginning at 10 a.m.  

A formal morning session and in-  
formal workshops in the after-  
noon are planned, with a bagged  
lunch break. Workshops are sche-  
duled to conclude at 2 p.m.  

The idea for a workshop grew,  
Ms. Quade explains, from an em-  
ployment seminar sponsored last  
fall by Federally Employed Women  
(FEW) of St. Paul.  

“Ours will follow that model,  
concentrating on federal reg-  
ulations and particularly the  
affirmative action rules. It's  
vital that women learn about  
these regulations. There are  
many local businesses, like  
Honeywell and Control Data, that  
are covered.""  

The regulations require that  
""affirmative action"" programs be  
designed and maintained by any  
contractor holding $50,000 or more  
in federal funds. ""That means the  
city of Minneapolis, with 4.6  
million in Model City funds a-  
lone,"" Ms. Quade asserts. ""That  
means the Cedar-Riverside Devel-  
opment, South High housing, the  
Institute of Arts.""  

Keynote speaker at the work-  
shop will be Mary Manning, re-  
gional director of the federal  
Department of Labor's Women's  
Division, who will describe the  
legal status of working women.  

Ms. Manning will be followed by  
Joan Munday, Federal Women's  
Program Coordinator for the U.S.  
Housing and Urban Development  
department (HUD); Ellen Dressel-  
hufs, local attorney specializing  
in equal employment rights; and  
Frances Boelter, employment spe-  
cialist from HUD's St. Paul of-  
fice.  

Afternoon workshops will cover  
such topics as federal garnish-  
ment laws, career ladders, and  
how to get an affirmative action  
program started. Resource per-  
sons will be available to dis-  
cuss employment problems with  
workshop participants.  

The workshop is aimed at ""any  
woman who needs or wants infor-  
mation—women who are housewives  
and want to reenter the labor  
market, underemployed women, un-  
employed women,"" Ms. Quade states.  

The affirmative action regula-  
tions, with other employment laws  
of importance to women, are the  
focus of the workshop, slated  
for Jan. 27 at Sabathani Com-  
munity Center. There is no  
charge for the program, which  
will feature workshops on spe-  
cific employment problems.  

Ms. Boelter describes problems  
common to working women, particu-  
larly those in the clerical field  
from which she started. ""Often  
a woman hired as a secretary or  
typist will do research, compile  
reports, and do other profession-  
al or paraprofessional duties—  
then when she looks for another  
job, she's just a secretary.""  

For this reason Ms. Boelter  
stresses the importance of  
“position descriptions—usually  
a management tool, but extremely  
beneficial to employees."" Such  
descriptions define the actual  
duties of each employee and  
are prepared cooperatively by  
employee and manager.  

Secretaries should be trained  
for professional or para-  
professional jobs, Ms. Boelter  
insists, so that there will  
be more mobility from clerical  
to higher ranks. ""This is an  
important issue for women, be-  
cause 95 percent of the clerical  
force is women and minorities,""  
she comments.  

""Job restructuring—taking a  
professional position, breaking  
out some jobs that don't need  
professional education, and  
giving those tasks to para-  
professionals."" Not only would this  
enable an agency or industry to  
hire fewer professionals, thus  
lowering costs, but ""it would  
give clerical workers somewhere  
to go.""  

Ms. Boelter suggests that col-  
lege-educated women entering  
professional fields have greater  
potential for upward mobility  
than do most secretaries. ""But  
we also see a lot of college-  
educated secretaries,"" she says,  
remarking that her agency and  
others have adopted policies  
which disallow this ""underhiring  
of women.""  

""Career development is as  
important to the employer as to  
the employee,"" Ms. Boelter con-  
cludes. ""It's not a matter of  
promising everyone a professional  
job, but of letting everyone work  

to their top capability, to get  

the best possible job from each  
person.”"

THE DESTINY OF  
WOMEN By Addie Mattson  

""I can applaud the present  
attitude of experimentation""  
in sexual roles. This was  
the closing comment of Dr.  
Eleanor Maccoby in her ad-  
dress to the 1973 Nobel Con-  
ference at Gustavus Adol-  
phus College recently. Dr.  
Maccoby is a research psy-  
chologist in the field of  
social and intellectual de-  
velopment of children at  
Stanford University.  

Dr. Maccoby dealt succes-  
sively with the entire  
sphere of criteria the sci-  
entific world has used to  
test sexual differences in  
the psychological area.  

She treated first upon the  
""feminine passive"" theory.  
Many people, scientists and  
laymen alike, attach great  
significance to the female  
supine position of the sex-  
ual act--the male intrusive  
and aggressive, the woman re-  
ceptive and passive. Dr.  
Maccoby raised the point at  
this juncture as to whether  
the female's withdrawal was  
not really a form of aggres-  
sion--if indeed, the female  
did not actually originate  
the sexual approach by her  
seeming reluctance which in  
turn stimulates the male to  
pursuit.  

Dr. Maccoby cited reactions  
of young children of both  
sexes under various (to a  
child) threatening circum-  
stances. Children of both  
sexes respond in certain  
ways to the appearance of a  
stranger, removal of a toy,  
a loud noise, but these re-  
actions are not governed  
along consistent sexual  
lines. That is, the number  
of boy toddlers who hollered  
""mama"" in one group was  
sometimes greater than the  
number of girls who cried,  
sometimes less.

Dr. Eleanor Maccoby  

When dealing with the ques-  
tion of an existing correla-  
tion between intellect and  
sex, Maccoby gave a simple  
yet thought-provoking illus-  
tration. She first related  
the case of a number of  
young teenage girls whose  
mothers had been given large  
amounts of male hormones  
during the course of their  
pregnancies. The girls were  
very active and competitive  
and had ""noticeably"" high  
I.Q.'s. (These attributes  
are generally considered  

to be masculine characteris-  
tics, of course).  

After the hum from the audi-  
ence died down, Maccoby  
grinned and then cited an-  
other group of girls whose  
mothers had been given fe-  
male hormones in large  
amounts while pregnant, and  
whose daughters were also  
highly competitive and in-  
telligent. The inference  
drawn from this, she said,  
was not that either male or  
female hormones had caused  
these qualities, but that  
the excessive amounts of  
hormones had made the differ-  
ences.  

Her point was well made:  
that even to the trained  
scientific mind, sometimes  
sexual differences and dis-  
tinctions lie in the eyes  
of the beholder; that even  
scientists sometimes see  
what they want to see.  

As Dr. Maccoby progressed  
more deeply into her lecture,  
a certain pattern began to  
emerge: that, in the early  
years (a few months to about  
three years of age) child  
development there are pre-  
cious few and inconsistent  
areas of differentiation be-  
tween the sexes.

How to meet people,  

verbal, mathematical and  
spatial visualization.  

On the first, verbal skills,  
she said that the feminine  
achievement in this area had  
been exaggerated. That al-  
though females talk earlier,  
the differences are still  
minimal in young children.  
The later ""talkativeness"" of  
women, she said, was due to  
conditioning which came into  
play as the parents began to  
reinforce stereotypes, i.e.,  
the strong silent male, the  
bubbly little ""daddy's girl"".  

Mathematical skills develop  
at an approximately even  
rate as well, again until  
role reinforcement comes  
into play.  

In spatial visualization,  
the development in the early  
years proceeds at an equal  
rate in children of both  
sexes.  
However,  

and this, I felt  

was Maccoby's most telling  
point, and the crux of her  
lecture, in mathematical  
skills and in spatial vis-  
ualization, by age seven or  
eight, boys are ahead of  
girls in these areas and as  
the children grow towards  
puberty, and beyond, the  
distinction grows more mark-  
ed and in time becomes a  
permanent differentiating  
factor.  

Dr. Maccoby found a vital  
link between the different  
achievement rates in math  
and spatial visualization  
skills at the early-teen  
stage. Girls, she said,  

at this age are very aware  
already of the ""feminine  
mystique"". They have learned  
to be ""smart enough to play  
dumb"". Already they have  
forfeited their psycholo-  
gical equality to social-  
sexual expediency."

Feminist Historian “Stumbles  
Over Women” in History  

by MARY HASTINGS  

Scott read diaries of Southern women and  
discovered truths lying behind many Ante-  
Bellum Southern myths about women and  
slavery. She noted that Southern women bore  
no resemblance to the Scarlett O'Hara proto-  
type. Rather, they were shrewd plantation  
supervisors who shouldered the responsibili-  
ty for such “indelicate” tasks as yearly  
hog-killing.  

Feminist pressures are changing people's  
behavior, but a Southern feminist histori-  
an doubts that ""people's assumptions (about  
women) have changed.""  

Talking on ""Feminism and History,"" Anne  
Firor Scott inaugurated a series of five  
evening lectures at 8 p.m. January 15 in  
Murphy Hall Auditorium on the University of  
Minnesota campus.  

Scott embarked on her feminist study  
some 20 years before women's studies were  
fashionable. She was a new kind of scholar  
who brought new insights into the record.  

The evening series is part of an Ameri-  
can Studies course called ""The Effects of  
Feminism on American Intellectual Life.""  

""My emotional involvement in this work  
kept me going,"" she explained. She learned  
that ""just because something isn't in the  
books doesn't mean it didn't happen.""  
""I am now learning to study the lives of  
obscure people,"" she said. “Women in Amer-  
ica have lived, to a great degree, in pri-  
vate, so there are many private records  
people must use to find out about women.""  

Prof. Elsa Green, coordinator of the  
course, introduced Scott to approximately  
275 persons. Scott is Senior Fellow at the  
Johns Hopkins Institute of Southern History  
and a specialist in the history of southern  
women.  

In assessing the effect of feminism on  
history, Scott noted that although ""femin-  
ist tactics"" have affected the atmosphere  
in American intellectual institutions, the  
proportion of women in them hasn't changed  
""since the agitation began.""  

In the early 1960s, Scott continued,  
""feminism--long latent--again burst on the  
scene.""  

She added that we are only half-way  
through the task of redefining the social  
history of America.  

Today a ""considerable number"" of young  
women have elected to become historians to  
find out more about themselves and ""these  
women have begun to redefine the whole fo-  
cus of historical inquiry.""  

""What we don't study reveals as much  
about a culture as what we do,"" Scott de-  
clared. And American historians--largely  
upper-middle class, white Protestant males--  
haven't studied women until the last few  
years.  

She added that the most striking aspect  
of this new group of women scholars is  
their ""extraordinary cooperation with one  
another--this cooperation makes knowledge  
grow faster.""  

Scott, a native Georgian, attended Har-  
vard University in the early 1940s and en-  
countered a ""pervasive anti-Southernism.""  
In reaction to this bias, she determined to  
write her thesis on Southern Progressives.  
And as she perused the records of the South  
since 1890, she ""kept stumbling over women""--  
women who were effective leaders and organ-  
izers of such causes as child labor laws.  

Following Scott's lecture the audience  
engaged her in a half-hour question and  
answer period.  

Prof. Mary Turpie, head of the American  
Studies Program, was also at the podium.  

""I was puzzled at first because I hadn't  
encountered women much in my graduate stud-  
ies. Male historians simply hadn't noticed  
women.""  

The next evening be January  
31 at 8 p.m. in Murphy Hall Auditorium.  
Carroll Smith Rosenberg, assistant profess-  
or of history and psychiatry at the Univ-  
ersity of Pennsylvania, will discuss the  
history of psychiatric thought.  

Her curiosity aroused, Scott set about  
discovering why Southern women had been so  
intent on remaining ""invisible and ladylike""  
while being ""quite revolutionary.""  

The evening lectures are free and open  
to the public.

Contraception  

A variety of techniques is  
employed to prevent pregnan-  
cy when sexual contact oc-  
curs. These all share the  
label ""contraceptive,"" but  
they differ widely in the  
way they work and in their  
convenience, cost, and ef-  
fectiveness. Table 1 shows  
the degrees of effectiveness  
of the contraceptive methods  
discussed in this manual.  

In this section several  
methods are discussed along  
with their advantages and  
disadvantages. Furthermore,  
some ""nonmethods,"" or tech-  
niques that are employed for  
the purpose of contraception  
but are ineffective, are de-  
scribed.  

The Dilemma of Preplanning  

Frequently high-school-age  
and college-age women are  
just beginning to be sexual-  
ly active. Moreover, they  
are at a time in their lives  
when they often have not ar-  
rived at a stable relation-  
ship and, therefore, may not  
have a single, permanent  
sexual partner. These two  
conditions combine to create  
a situation wherein many wo-  
men do not know whether they  
will be engaging in sexual  
intercourse the following  
month, week, or day. Some-  
times women conclude from  
this uncertainty that they  
should not prepare them-  
selves for, or protect them-  
selves from the results of,  
sexual intercourse, because  
it would somehow indicate  
that they are promiscuous.  
Tied in with this concept is  
the notion that ""nice girls""  

don't voluntarily submit to  
sexual relations, that they  
are pressured into them. In  
response to this, one can  
only say that in our society  
the burden of contraception  
typically falls on the fe-  
male and that women who do  
not assume this burden are  
usually women who get preg-  
nant. It is, of course,  
true that a few women may  
engage in intercourse the  
first time without having  
any idea beforehand that in-  
tercourse would take place,  
but after the first sexual  
act if not before, a woman  
should inform and prepare  
herself for future contra-  
ception. Preplanning may be  
temporarily damaging to  
one's self-image, but preg-  
nancies out of wedlock,  
which accounted for one-  
eighth of the children born  
in Seattle in 1968, are of-  
ten damaging to lives in  
more permanent and costly  
ways.  

This is not to imply that  
the burden of contraception  
should always fall on the  
female. Morally, men have  
an obligation to protect  
themselves and their partner  
and they should share the  
effort involved in success-  
ful contraceptive planning.  
(But don't count on it!)  

Birth Control Pills  

""The pill,"" which is al-  
most 100 percent effective  
when taken as instructed,  
produces a state of pseudo  
(or false) pregnancy in the  
body and thus prevents ovu-  
lation. There are two types  

of oral contraceptives, and  
with each the woman takes  

pills for twenty or twenty-  

and Nonmethods  
of Contraception  

one days of her menstrual  
cycle, starting on the fifth  
day after menses. One type  
is the combination, contain-  
ing both estrogen and pro-  
gestin. The other type is  
the sequential pill. Its  
name derives from the fact  
that for the first fifteen  
days following menses the  
woman takes a pill contain-  
ing just estrogen, followed  
by five pills containing  
both estrogen and progestin.  
The sequentials have been  
shown to be less effective  
and somewhat more hazardous  
than the combination pill.  
The pill frequently has  
side effects that may be  
negative, positive, or neu-  
tral. For the most part,  
these same side effects are  
associated with pregnancy.  
It may clear up the complex-  
ion, may prompt a small gain  
in weight, and may enlarge  
the breasts slightly. Its  
use also may be associated  
with increased or diminished  
sexual desire. Some clear  
advantages of the pill:  
1. It is easy to use and is  
believed to be the most ef-  
fective method, PROVIDED IT  
IS TAKEN DAILY!  
2. It is one of very few  
contraceptives that is inde-  
pendent of the sex act:  
nothing need be done immedi-  
ately before, during, or af-  
ter intercourse.  
3. It is not subject to  
those errors of use that of-  
ten affect the reliability  
of the mechanical methods  
after sexual interest has  
been aroused.

some brands include seven

periods, lightens the flow,  
and may eliminate cramps.  

Two types of disadvantages  
are associated with the  
pill:  

The first is a group of  
minor side effects that re-  
semble symptoms of early  
pregnancy and commonly dis-  
appear after the first few  
months of taking the pill.  
They may include nausea,  
breast tenderness, depres-  
sion, nervousness, backache,  
or increased vaginal dis-  
charge, which may be linked  
to increased rates of yeast  
infection associated with  
usage of the pill. However,  
these are not experienced by  
all women who take the pill.  

The second type of disad-  
vantage associated with the  
pill has to do with its  
safety, which recently has  
been the subject of much in-  
vestigation. The official  
government verdict as to the  
safety of using oral contra-  
ceptives is that while risks  
exist, ""When these potential  
hazards and the value of the  
drugs are balanced, the com-  
mittee finds the ratio of  
benefit to risk sufficiently  
high to justify the designa-  
tion safe within the intent  
of the legislation.""**  

The major hazard is an in-  
creased tendency of a few  
pill-taking women toward  
blood-clotting diseases,  
such as thrombophlebitis.  
This ailment can sometimes  
result in a pulmonary embol-  
ism, or blood clot in the  
lung, which is often disabl-  
ing and can be fatal. The  
frequency of such a fatal  
side effect is low: about  
1.5 deaths per 100,000 pill-  
taking women under 35 years  
of age, and 4 deaths per  
100,000 for women over 35.  
These rates may be compared  
with the death rate of preg-  
nant women who die from com-  
plications during their  
pregnancy: 20 to 25 per  
100,000 women. Moreover, it  
is estimated that for every  
100,000 illegal abortions,  
about 100 women die.  

There are unanswered ques-  
tions about a possible con-  
nection between taking the  
pill and acquiring cancer,  

especially of the cervix or  
the breast; about metabolic  
effects, such as diabetes

Pills vary widely in the amounts of estrogen and pro-  

gestins they contain.  

While there are some differences  

in the various compounds and their biologic activity,  
many authorities feel that those differences are not im-  

portant and that,  

in general, the less medication, the  
better, particularly in the amount of estrogens.  

Listed  

above are the pills now approved by the FDA, divided into  

two groups, the combinations and the sequentials.  

The  

preparations are listed in order of increasing estrogen  
component per tablet, then in order of increasing  
progestin component per tablet, and then, when estrogen  
and progestin components are the same, in order of  
increasing number of tablets per month.*

Injectable Contraceptives  

Injectable contraceptives  
(dipo-provera) are a new and  
still experimental type of  
contraceptive. They have...  

been used on a limited basis  
for several years and are  
just now becoming available  
to members of the medical  
profession, who may pre-  
scribe them for contracep-  
tive purposes. Their poten-  
tial drawbacks limit their  
distribution to women who  
are quite certain that they  
have finished their child-  
bearing or that they want no  
children. These contracep-  
tives should be available  
for general use in a few  
years.  

Injectable contraceptives  
are ovulatory depressants  
that consist of progesterone  
acetate, which is injected  
into the patient once every  
three months. Their advan-  
tages include the facts that

one injection lasts for a
three-month period, that
they have been demonstrated
to be at least as effective
as the pill because there is
almost no opportunity for
patient error, and that they
have minimal side effects.
Because the injected medica-
tion doesn't include estro-
gen, the dangers associated
with estrogen in birth-con-
trol pills aren't present.
One side effect is an almost

complete absence of menstru-
ation during the time the
woman is using the contra-
ceptive. A potential disad-
vantage is that menstruation
and ovulation may not begin
again for as long as a year
after cessation of injec-
tions. It is for this rea-
son that the use of injecta-
ble contraceptives is not
recommended for women who
are planning to have child-
ren.

This contraceptive method
is still being tested, and
women who select it as their
method of birth control
should recognize that re-
search on long-term effects
hasn't been completed. How-
ever, the method is availa-
ble through some agencies
and private physicians,
especially if the woman is
older and has no plans for
childbearing.

Intrauterine Device (IUD)

The intrauterine device is
a loop, ring, coil, or
shield made of malleable
plastic and inserted into
the uterine cavity. It is
inserted during menstrua-
tion, preferably on the
first day of the period, and
begins to function immedi-
ately to prevent conception.
While the IUD follows steri-
lization, injectable contra-
ceptives, and the pill in
effectiveness, a few women
out of every hundred women
using it for one year do be-
come pregnant. These un-
planned pregnancies can re-
sult, after expulsion of the
IUD from the uterus without
the woman's knowledge or can
occur with the IUD in place.
Expulsion is most likely to
occur within the first three
months after the device has
been installed. It is par-
ticularly during this period
that users should check to
see that it is in place be-
fore depending on it for
protection. This is done by
reaching into the vagina and
feeling for a small nylon
string that is attached to
the IUD. Unplanned pregnan-
cies with the IUD still in
place are most likely during
the first eighteen months.

Part II
Contraception and
Nonmethods of Contraception

For the woman to be fully
protected, an additional
form of protection against
pregnancy, such as foam or
condom, should be used dur-
ing the middle part of the
menstrual cycle.

Exactly how the IUD works
is not known. Physicians
believe that it either sets
up muscular movements that
force the egg into the uter-
us before it is ready to be
implanted there, or it some-
how prevents the walls of
the uterus from accepting
the fertilized egg.

The advantages of the IUD
are limited to the 50 percent
to 75 percent of the female
population whose bodies tol-
erate it. Two advantages
are that, once in place, it
furnishes contraception in-
definitely and that the only
cost is the initial one.*
Moreover, like the pill, it
is a birth-control technique
that is independent of the
sexual act, except that for
the first several months af-
ter insertion users should
make sure it is in place be-
fore intercourse. Addition-
ally, when a woman wishes
to become pregnant, the IUD
is readily removable by a
physician.

A major disadvantage is
that about 25 percent of the
women who have been fitted
with IUDs experience pain or

*Use of extra midcycle pro-
tection in the form of foam
or condoms naturally adds to
the total cost of this meth-
od of contraception.

excessive menstrual bleeding
sufficient to require their
removal. Over a five-year
period, the proportion who
can continue to use the IUD
drops to about 50 percent.

A few women expel it, some
discovering that they have
done so only when they be-
come pregnant. Younger wo-
men and women who never have
had a pregnancy are those
most likely to experience
difficulties with the IUD.
However, a new device, the
Dalkon shield, has been
successfully tolerated by
women who have never been
pregnant. The shield is
less likely to be rejected,
and its use creates less
cramping and bleeding.
Another difficulty experienc-
ed by a few women is infec-
tion of the pelvic organs
because while qualified
physicians use sterilized
instruments to insert the
IUD, bacteria from the vagi-
na can enter the uterus
during insertion. It is im-
portant that a woman with a
vaginal infection not be fit-
ted with an IUD until the
condition is under control;
otherwise, the risk of pel-
vic infection would be in-
creased. A final, but very
slight, risk is uterine
perforation, experienced by
fewer than forty women out
of every hundred thousand.
Uterine perforation, in
which the IUD punctures the
uterus and moves into the
abdominal cavity, can be
corrected surgically."
GoldFlower,1,11,january 1973,12,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol1No11_page012.txt,"Diaphragm

The diaphragm is a rubber, dome-shaped device that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to cover the cervix to prevent sperm's entering it. To be effective, it must be used with a spermicidal cream or jelly, which is placed on both the inside and the outside and around the edge of the diaphragm. The diaphragm must be specially fitted for each woman by a physician. Refitting is sometimes necessary. For effective contraception, refitting is recommended if the original fitting was before or shortly after the loss of virginity, after a miscarriage or childbirth, after an operation, or after a weight gain or loss of at least ten pounds. A diaphragm will last for several years before it must be replaced.

The diaphragm can be inserted up to three to six hours before intercourse and shouldn't be removed until at least six hours after ejaculation. It may be left in place as long as twenty-four hours.

The diaphragm is less effective than the pill or the IUD. Out of every hundred women who use diaphragms for a full year, about twelve are likely to become pregnant. This failure rate, however, is largely due to improper use, and it is reduced to about three per year per hundred women if the diaphragm is carefully used with ample cream or jelly.

The main advantage of the diaphragm is that its use is completely safe. No side effects or long-range health hazards are associated with its use. A further advantage for those who have intercourse only occasionally is that it is used only at the time of intercourse and does not require taking medication for weeks or months when no intercourse is taking place.

The primary disadvantage of the diaphragm is that it must be inserted just before intercourse. Some feel that this action reduces spontaneity of the sex act. Also, it can become dislodged during intercourse. Masters and Johnson found that displacement occurs most often when a coital position other than the face-to-face, male-above position is used.

Condom

The condom, also called the rubber, the prophylactic, or the safety, is a thin rubber or animal-tissue sheath that is worn on the penis during intercourse. When used properly, it is about as effective as the diaphragm. The condom is unrolled onto the erect penis so that there is enough space at the tip for the ejaculate. Reservoir tip condoms are recommended. The penis must be withdrawn from the vagina immediately after the male ejaculates, while it is still erect.

The condom should be carefully removed, and the hands and the penis should be washed, particularly if the couple is going to continue to be in close physical contact.

A major advantage of the condom is that it is the only really effective means of contraception that can be purchased without a prescription. Another advantage is that, if used conscientiously and throughout the entire period of sexual contact, it may provide protection against venereal disease. Condoms are especially suited to those couples who have intercourse only occasionally and do not wish to go to the trouble and the expense of using the pill during periods in which there is no intercourse. Some problems with using the condom can be alleviated by careful selection. Condoms made of animal skin, while slightly more expensive, will minimize loss of sensation to the male. ""Wet,"" or lubricated, condoms that will aid vaginal entry are also available.

A spermicidal cream or jelly can be used both to improve effectiveness and to aid in entry. One of these is applied to the condom after it is put on the penis. It should never be applied to the penis itself, because this could cause the condom to slip off during intercourse. Vaseline and other petroleum jelly should be avoided, because they can cause the rubber to deteriorate and tear.

Although condoms are 98 percent effective when used properly (put on before any penile penetration), even greater protection can be obtained by using the condom in combination with a spermicide, such as foam. This increases the protection to the same level as provided by the pill (100 percent).

Condoms are available at most pharmacies. The price varies by brand and by particular features, e.g., lubrication, and ranges from 30 cents to 75 cents each (10 cents each at Planned Parenthood).

Vaginal Spermicides

All spermicidal contraceptives consist of two components, a spermicide and a nonreactive base. The latter provides most of the substance and functions as a diaphragm to block mechanically. (See Figure 3.) Spermicidal contraceptives include aerosol foams, gels, creams, and suppositories. Each must be used immediately prior to intercourse, the time varying from type to type but ranging from fifteen minutes to one hour preceding intercourse.

Of all the types, the aerosol foam is probably the easiest to use and the least messy. It is also more likely to provide sufficient substance to cover the cervix and thus to prevent conception. Spermicidal suppositories are somewhat less effective. They should not be confused with ""feminine hygiene"" suppositories, which do not prevent conception.

The major disadvantage of using such contraceptives is that foreplay must be interrupted to apply them. Also, women may not urinate or walk around after they have been applied. Women who prefer to douche after intercourse must wait at least six hours. Spermicides must be reapplied if intercourse is to be repeated.

Vaginal spermicides are somewhat less effective than the diaphragm. Their effectiveness can be improved to 100 percent by using them in combination with the condom.

Spermicides can be purchased without prescription at most pharmacies. Aerosol foams are slightly more expensive than tablets or gels. Monthly contraceptive cost for this method would run between $1 and $...

This month Feminists of both sexes will have an unprecedented opportunity to get together with those of the same persuasion. University of Minnesota Women's Liberation will, on Feb. 2 and 3, sponsor a conference on The New Feminism: Cultural, Educational, Church Women and Political Implications. Feminist actions on a local, national, and international scale will be discussed. Guest speakers of national renown have been obtained. Present will be Flo Kennedy, black activist, civil rights lawyer, co-founder of NOW and the Feminist Party, and author of Abortion Rap, and Barbara Roberts, M.D., coordinator of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition and part-time abortionist in her home state of Maryland. Also present will be an abortion rights activist from Canada, and a local black woman who will discuss forced sterilization.  

There will be a women's art display, and women poets and singers will present their work. There will be a multi-media show and a well-known feminist film will be aired.  

The function will be held in Coffman Memorial Union at the University of Minnesota. Admission will be inexpensive. For more information, give us a ring at 373-0033.  

The opportunity to not only pull the Feminist community together, but to be entertained and inspired is without parallel. All are welcome, all are urged to come and support it.

by Jan Jirak

A woman's rising conscious-
ness in the liberation move-
ment can be compared to the
instance of someone standing
on your foot. At first you
say, ""Excuse me, but you're
standing on my foot."" In
rare instances, the offender
will say, ""Oh, I'm sorry--""
and get off. More often,
through blindness, he will
say, ""No, I'm not--you must
be imagining things."" Recog-
nizing his myopia, and trying
to be sympathetic, you say,
""Pardon me, sir, but you are
standing on my foot, and it
does hurt."" This exchange
will probably repeat itself
several times with increas-
ing emotion on both sides
until finally the offender
backs off.

Too often the stander's
nose is too high in the air
to let him notice the stand-
ee. This calls for action.
Sometimes you must push him
off. He gets hostile and
complains about how ""women's
libbers"" make everything in-
to a power struggle. Usual-
ly the support of other wo-
men is needed to get him
off.

Since women have been step-
ped on for so long, many
of them, not knowing any
other state of affairs, ac-
tually think they like it.
They even ""invite"" such ac-
tions by exposing their feet
and embellishing them until
they look good enough to
walk on. Of course, most
men take the mere presence
of female feet as an invita-
tion.

Women, too, are accomp-
lices in the assault. They
encourage it by treating
themselves and other women
as though they were capable
only of being stepped on.
""Anatomy is destiny""--you
were made with feet, so they
were made to be stepped on.
(Men have feet, too--I won-
der why their anatomy gives
them a different destiny.)

As a result of a long his-
tory of being stepped on,
many women are ""flat-footed""
--and as much as they'd like
to walk on their own two
feet, they limp. Even if
their powers haven't been
damaged, everyone thinks
they have; so they have to
walk twice as fast as a man
to keep up with him. Em-
ployers don't trust her to
keep walking; they think
she'll just get married and
go back to being stepped on
again.

And so, until we all get
back on our feet again, I
recommend supportive shoes
to help us walk (women's
organizations) and a little
foot powder (women's publi-
cations) to make the walk
easier.

: Praxis School

Beginning January 17, the
""Socialist Feminism""
The Praxis School will enter
its second quarter. The
class has three parts; ""His-
Story,"" which was covered in
the fall; ""Theory"" which will
be covered this quarter; and
""Strategy,"" which will be
tackled in the spring. Each
quarter, and indeed each
class meeting, however, is
open to all.

: Freedom and Justice

We felt that when we were
on more solid ground in the
history and theory of femin-
ism, we could develop a use-
ful strategy to liberate
both women and the oppress-
ed.

For the title ""Socialist Fem-
inism"" is in earnest: we re-
ject the notion of women
simply receiving a bigger
piece of the American pie;
we want a just society.

Fusion in the Maze
The attempt to fuse femin-
ism and socialism is not as
yet finished, and in most
ways has, as yet, been far
from successful. But the
need remains: our daily ex-
perience can rarely tell us
whether we should be a lib-
eral feminist, or a social-
ist feminist. 

Understanding the varying view of real-
ity each kind of feminism
assumes, and looking at our
own experience in light of
such a view, can help us
find our way through the
maze. It is for this reason
that the theory course
offered this quarter seems
so crucial. Many of us have
read various feminist works
(Beauvoir, Firestone, Greer,
etc.) as they stimulated us
to change our lives, to be-
come feminists at all. Most
of us also have predilections
to various positions on the
political spectrum, usually
from extreme left to
liberal. But few of us have
read these same feminist
works critically and compar-
atively, with an eye to
their broader political per-
spective. It is this task
we plan to begin this quart-
er. As a special treat, we
will also be reading the new
theoretical works put
forward by various women's
groups: The Chicago Women's
Union political statement;
The NAM (New American Move-
ment) sexual politics paper;
papers read at the Socialist
Feminist Conference held
over Thanksgiving in Durham,
N.C.

The Praxis School is spon-
sored by the Mpls. chapter
of the New American Movement,
a new national organization
struggling for democratic
socialism in the U.S. Other
NAM projects include The
North Country Peace Campaign,
a political education and
action project, and The Met-
ropolitan Taskforce, a group
researching and struggling
to change the local balance
of power. The ""Socialist
Feminist"" class meets Wed-
nesdays from 7:30 to 9:30,
for six weeks. Tuition is
by donation.

The Politics of Abortion

By Mary Retsinas

I am respectfully compelled
to answer Jan Jirak's arti-
cle. To begin with, we do
not hate men. That is a slan-
der that has been used against
the women's movement since
the year one. It has been
used to scare women away from
the women's movement and away
from fulfilling themselves,
because by so doing they are,
by definition, a threat to
men. We do not hate men. We
love our sisters, and hate the
oppression of women. If
hatred happens to be a part of
our collective personality,
we must not forget that hatred
is one facet of a healthy per-
sonality. It is when hatred
is inappropriate to the situa-
tion that it becomes unhealthy.
It is a common phenomenon
among oppressed peoples to
find members turning on one
another in response to exter-
nal frustration, instead of
directing the resulting hatred
constructively against the
source of the oppression.
Women must strive to overcome
this tendency, because what-
ever political direction we
take, it will be too important
to be frittered away in self-
hatred. It is quite falla-
cious to say 'people who hate
find their ability to love
atrophied.' Please; let's be
honest. Human love is very
freely mixed with hatred.

The 'Women Hate' point is a

'Population control is es-
sential,' the article says.
But population control is not
the issue at all. ""Popula-
tion control"" is something
practiced by power-trippers
who get a kick out of mani-
pulating others. Population
control is what happened when
the Pill was originally ex-
perimented with, with Puerto
Rican women used as guinea
pigs. Population control is
what happens when black women
and women on welfare are
sterilized without their know-
ledge or consent. Population
control is what's happening
now in Southeast Asia, where
they're trying out a risky
birth control injection.
Population control is also
genocide, and we deplore it
and want no part of it. What
we want is for people to be
able to control their own
bodies and lives, which might
wind up being to the disad-
vantage of those who have
taken the decision away, and
want to control their stock-
pile of cannon fodder.

means to control our own
bodies, this would have all
kinds of repercussions with
our psyches and with society.
If women were not constantly
tormented by the fear of un-
wanted pregnancy, there could
be no keeping us down.

Of course a fetus has life,
but then, so do carrots and
frogs, and so, at one time,
did the hamburger you ate for
lunch. Nobody calls them
""human."" There are those who
feel that fetal life is human
life, and their opinion is to
be respected in a democratic
fashion, but this minority
has no right to impose its
will on the majority. No one
should be forced into an abor-
tion, nor should be forced
out of it. The decision must
be the responsibility of the
individual woman.

There is a final reality
that must be faced: the
reality of the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of
women each year at the hands
of illegal abortionists under
conditions that are shocking
and humiliating and filthy
and inhumane. Also not to be
forgotten are the thousands
of unwanted children whose
parents torture them: starve
them, break their bones, burn
them with cigarette butts,
hold them in boiling water.
Both are forms of human misery
that could be largely eradi-
cated by safe, legal abortion.

In early March the Women's
National Abortion Action
Coalition will hold an inter-
national tribunal on the sub-
ject of abortion, contracep-
tion, and forced steriliza-
tion. Women who have had

bly sterilized are urged to

testify. All are welcome to

meant as a cautionary note
against the dangers of ex-

for not expressing that more
clearly.

I also agree that all peo-
ple should control their own
bodies. That is why I can't
agree with abortion (as much
as that would simplify
life): abortion denies the
child all control over her
(or his) own body."""

Aquarius is often called
the sign of the procrastin-
ator and Arcotti--as an
Aquarius of the first water
--thus duly sits to compose
this column mere hours be-
fore deadline.

This is not, of course, to
suggest that Aquarius is
lazy. Far from it, she is
the living exemplar of the
adage, “If you want some-
thing done, ask a busy per-
son to do it.""

Women of the Waterbearer's
sign have much to learn from
the greatest of their breed--
women like Virginia Woolf,
Elizabeth Blackwell, Susan
B. Anthony, Gertrude Stein,
Susan Sontag, Amy Lowell--
and what these women teach
is the lesson of concentra-
ted energy. Any common-
place Aquarian (Aquarienne?)
has energy to spare, but she
deludes herself that it is
boundless and squanders it
in meaningless projects.

Rumors abound about this
eleventh zodiacal sign, most
of them flattering but mis-
leading. So, in an orderly

the circumstances that give
rise to them.

1. Altruism. Aquarius be-
ing conversationally promis-
cuous, her social manner
suggests that she is a true
egalitarian, associating
with persons of any class,
color, creed or sex. Alas,
the lass too often is spur-
red less by humanitarian in-
terest than by fascination
with the unusual, for Aquar-
ius commits herself sélect-
ively and then usually to
those she considers of her
own superior mentality. If
you have ever felt frauded
by Aquarian ""altruism,"" bear

in mind that this sign above

all is able to love mankind
and dislike people.

2. Eccentricity. Ah, ec-
centricity. The Aquarius
female is oft pictured as
a strange old lady who in-
sists on wearing tennis
shoes in winter to match her
straw fedora. An exaggera-
tion, that, but Aquarius
herself is prone to exagger-
ate, whence springs many of
those curious mannerisms of
which astrologers love to
gossip.

Aquarius occurs when the
sun, opposite the sign it
rules, is weakest; the Aqua-
rius ego is the weakest in
the zodiac. Hold the jeers

momentarily: Aquarius exag-

gerates herself because she
fears she'd be overlooked
if she didn't. Contradict-
ory Aquarius desperately
wants to stand out from the
masses of humanity--which
she professes to love.

3. Loyalty. Although each
Aquarian will have a differ-
ent excuse for her aloof-
ness, all are difficult to
know well. But once you've
penetrated her defenses,
you'll have to amputate her
from your life to be rid of
her. Probably Aquarius’ fin-
est capability is that of
loyal friendship, in which
sex is an optional part.

To understand Aquarius,
watch your reactions as the
sun transits that sign.
People curse the midwinter
cold; they've left their
boots at home and are light-
ly dressed. Spring, still
months away, seems to hang
in the air, and the omni-
present snow insults our
expectations. Just so, Aqua-
rius lives in the future and
is impatient with the pre-
sent."

recent Midwest visit, every woman is a poten-  
tial welfare case, often “just one man away  
from welfare.""  

It is an unpleasant economic fact that few  
women can earn enough to support a family  
without financial aid, either from a man or  
from the state. And it is an unpleasant so-  
cial fact that women who are forced to obtain  
the latter form of aid are castigated in pop-  
ular stereotype as ""welfare loafers"" despite  
the lack of daycare centers and adequate jobs  
that would make employment possible for them.  

Public aid, usually in the form of Aid to  
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) per-  
mits single mothers to devote themselves to  
child care, but women are stigmatized by re-  
ceipt of such aid. In light of a recent  
University of Minnesota study which proved  
stereotypes of the ""welfare mother"" to be  
without foundation, GOLD FLOWER interviewed  
three such mothers who described their lives  
on AFDC; their names have been changed in  
the following story to protect their privacy.  

The UM study of 100 randomly selected AFDC  
mothers in Hennepin County revealed that one-  
third of welfare mothers are employed at  
least part-time, and that 80 percent desire  
to work despite the difficulties employment  
would present. Only one recipient in 20 has  
never been married, while three-quarters  
have been married only once. Most welfare  
mothers are white; few have received aid for  
more than three years. The three mothers to  
whom we spoke provide a representative cross-  
section of these women.  

Rhonda is in her early twenties. The mo-  
ther of two pre-school children, she works  
part-time at a day care center. She enjoys  
her job but worries over the children, es-  
pecially her son who demands daily reassur-  
ances of her affection.  

Annie, a 33-year-old former social worker,  
has an infant daughter. Her four older chil-  
dren live with her former husband, but Annie  
sees them frequently. She is active in com-  
munity affairs and is anxious to return to  
work when her child is older.  

Three of Sally's children live at home; her  
oldest son lives in California. Poor health  
has prevented her from working for two years  
but recent surgery, she hopes, has corrected  
her ailments. She too is eager to return to  
work; in her 40 years she has held jobs ran-  
ging from domestic worker to secretary.  

To Rhonda, who separated from her husband  
recently, finances pose the biggest problem.  
""I get $125 for rent, for a two-bedroom fur-  
nished apartment, $60 for food stamps--that  
means about $105 worth of food for the month  
--and about $6 for phone,"" she says.  

""Of course we get medical and dental care,  
too. But there's no allowance for a damage  
deposit on an apartment, or for deposit or  
installation of a phone. So many people  
that you run into don't understand how much  
-or how little--money we really get.  

""I'm getting bitter,"" she admits. ""It's  
really more hassle to work than sit at home.""  

Because of her part-time job, she must pay  
babysitting and carfare costs out of her al-  
ready pinched budget. She estimates that  
she has ""about $10 a month"" left after she  
pays her family's basic living expenses.  

""I don't even have enough to buy baby as-  
pirin,"" she sighs.  

Her parents, she says, live far away and  
""don't have money themselves to help."" They  
feel that she “shouldn't be living off the  
state, that the kids' father should support  
them."" Rhonda's husband is an unemployed  
craftsman.  

Rhonda maintains that she has faced dis-

For Women on Welfare

crimination because of her financial status.  
""I've called up apartments where they wouldn't  
rent to me because I'm on AFDC. One  
landlady even told me not to report her,”  
she exclaims. ""And the neighbors are often  
unsympathetic--they always seem to know if  
you're on AFDC or not.  

""So many people think we're lazy, that we  
don't want anything else,"" Rhonda says. ""I  
have talked to so many welfare mothers, and  
I know this is untrue. Or landlords will  
say, the ‘last AFDC mother I had here was no  
good--the attitude is, you're all alike so  
why give you a chance.""  

She worries about her children and how  
their financial plight will affect them.  

""I'm torn between my children and working.  
I really love my job. I feel useful and  
feel I'm helping the city--but every morning  

""Are you coming home, aren't you, mom?""  

Rhonda's eyes fill as she speaks of her  
son's uncertainty.  

""I understand what the name ‘welfare moth-  
er' means and what you go through. I try my  
best to help people to change their mind,""  
Rhonda says.  

Annie is wryly amused at her current situa-  
tion. ""I worked with AFDC mothers for  
years,"" she recalls. ""I was doing group  
work with AFDC mothers in 1958.""  

She and her second husband separated while  
she was pregnant; when a promised social  
work position did not materialize, she ap-  
plied for AFDC aid.  

She complains that welfare workers are of-  
ten unfeeling or unkind towards their  
clients. ""Before my baby was born, I asked  
for a crib. The worker said I would have to  
wait four months, and 'til then, just use a  
big cardboard box.'” Fortunately, a crib was  
donated.  

Annie feels that she is equipped to cope  
with most of her problems. “But I'm educa-  
ted, I've worked for years, I should be able  
to cope with people,"" she says. ""I don't  
know how women without such resources can  
cope with the situation.""  

Sally, a middle-aged black mother, lacks  
Annie's education but has successfully dealt  
with her plight. ""I hate it, I hate being  
on it (AFDC),"" she says. ""It can be a good  
thing when you need it, so I really don't  
want to put it down. But I want to go back  
to work as soon as I am able.""  

Health problems have handicapped Sally for

Dear Goldflower:  

Although your name is  
that of a Chinese peasant  
woman, your position is that  
of the NOW women, liberal,  
professional, reform-minded—  
whose goal seems to be a  
mirror of the male world: we  
now see around us.  

This leaves out in the  
cold the women who want a  
complete change, who had en-  
visioned Women's Liberation  
as bringing about a new era  
in which compassion and  
human emotion would change  
all the structures that  
exist today so they could  
operate freely. When you  
talk about working women or  
the housewife or the Chicano  
or the Black women you  
talk about them, you make  
no effort to reach them.  
With the paper the way it is  
today, there is nothing in  
it for them.  

Your way, of course, is  
safe and you will make gains  
for the middle-class  
professional woman. The way  
I advocate has nothing to  
offer but struggle for an  
ideal. To open the minds of  
working women and housewives,  
to organize them, to build  
bridges to our sisters who  
have different colored skin  
will be difficult indeed in  
this time of official govern-  
ment repression and fear  
and hate. Yet this is the  
road, I feel, which will  
lead to real liberation, not  
only of women, but of men.  
This road, I believe, has a  
chance of ridding our coun-  
try of the twin cancers of  
war and racism. Does any-  
one besides myself want to  
follow it? Do you dare to  
print this letter?

Letters  
Minneapolis Tribune  
Minneapolis, Minn.  

Dear Editor:  

The December 26 article by  
George Vessey, ""More women  
hitchhike; more are assault-  
ed,"" exposes some often-  
heard biases. Considering  
that U.S. females earn lit-  
tle more than half of what  
males do for regular employ-  
ment, that we are systemati-  
cally discouraged and kept  
from access to the technolo-  
gy of automobile maintain-  
ance (and of weapons by the  
way), and that walking and  
mass transit dangers can  
leave one quite vulnerable,  
is it not surprising young  
women have become only a  
quarter of those resorting  
to hitching to make their  
way around? (I assume an-  
other fourth is not old  
women.)  

Though I've had some won-  
derfully good experiences  
while thumbing (usually a  
neglected aspect), I really  
wouldn't have minded being  
able to own and transport  
myself in the white busi-  
nessman's late model Buick  
in which I had the most  
fearful experience. I've  
read that in a European  
country (Czechoslovakia?)  
those who take the opportun-  
ity to drive cars are ex-  
pected to report the number  
of people to whom they give  
rides for the gas that's  
used. Those here who once  
abuse the privilege of shar-  
ing should be banned from  
the roads, not the needy  
travellers.  

If young women are statis-  
tically more subject to vio-  
lent crimes, the response  
should be training in self-  
defense and in practical  
hitchhiking skills, rather  
than legitimizing them as  
objects of violence. This  
seems to be happening when  
young men see a police cap-  
tain quoted as saying we  
(female hitchhikers) ""prac-  
tically invite rape""—by our  
very existence apparently.  
When you see that the  
streets belong to the men,  
cars belong to the men, law  
enforcement also, and news-  
paper stories, you realize  
you have a place someone is  
trying to keep you in.  
""They placed themselves in a  
position where it could hap-  
pen to them,"" another police  
quote. Let's then name the  
game when I do retreat to  
the safety of one man's side  
—in his car or his house.  
How much protection racket  
and how much free choice in  
an atmosphere of justice and  
equality?

Goodbye  

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN  

?  

There are men who muse about making accep-  
tance speeches, but letters of resignation  
are more often the stuff of women's dreams.  

Shortly after my initiation into the ranks  
of scurrying working women, I too adopted a  
characteristic preoccupation. It was not  
""How to beat the Boss,"" a little too opti-  
mistic for us in those days. Rather, and  

sadly, it was ""How to keep the Boss from  
beating you.""  

And really, there was only one way - to  
quit. Sure, you might see him on the street  

and be free to grin and disappear. Sure,  
you could do your slave bit for him at the  
office with a manufactured irony, hoping  
that he would notice and be ashamed.  

But these private tactics were too subtle  
to take any effect, and I repeatedly found  
myself imagining that I was not typing his  
letter, but my own, whooping out my glad  
goodbye.  

I didn't get around to actually doing it  
for months. There were bad days, and then  
not-so-bad ones, depending on how fast the  
hours went. When a better job loomed up,  
quite unexpectedly, I found that writing a  
resignation letter took only a few minutes,  
and didn't really resemble my precipitous  
practice runs.  

Riding on a small backwash of conversa-  
tional confidence, I thought I could say my  
parting views best in person, believing that  
a blood and flesh human being would be hard-  
er to ignore than a piece of paper. But it  
all depends on what kind of flesh that human  
being wears; the girl-flesh I was wearing  
did not exactly strike dangerous honesty in-  
to the heart of my well-protected Boss.  

Our Man in Personnel hesitantly accepted  
my request for an exit interview. I had the  
backing of several women who were not leav-  
ing, who hoped I could ease their coming  
days by dredging up their multiple discon-  
tents from the depths of the corporate con-  
science.  

As I was escorted into his office, I deci-  
ded to assume a tentative approach and  
phrased the broad problems of working women  
in the narrower terms of educated women  
within his company.  

I could have spared him my delicacy. One  
thing frontrunning feminists have brought on  
all of us is instant visibility; experienced  
men like this personnel Boss now scent out  
""liberated women"" as eagerly as government  
committees once tracked down past, present,  
and future Communists.  

So the statistics flew from his corner of  
the room into mine, followed shortly by apt  
comparisons. We spoke “relatively“ for a  
time. Despite my lowkey opener, he hit me  
with the high notes, sounding out the cor-  
porate defense with rapid-fire trills of in-  

nocence: ""We try...you just don't know...  
other companies...this is a business world.  
growth...you can't expect...""  

I sat tight, maybe too tight. I suggested  
that we not talk about the triumphant ap-  
pointment of a woman to head teller after  
she had held the job for five years but not  
the title. Maybe we should consider what  
happened to the average woman in the com-  
pany, I said, as compared to the average  
man.  

Not a valid comparison I was told. Let's  
compare women's positions in our institution  
to those of women in other companies.  

It wasn't as if I hadn't been in circles  
before. But my ears began to churn and my  
throat swallowed when I didn't want it to.  
How could all my forthright intentions and  
painfully acquired knowledge be swallowed so  
effortlessly, without even riling the Boss'  
digestion? We were both in corners of the  

room, but it was easy to see who had trapped  
who.  

I didn't get anywhere that afternoon, and  
I lost a dose of confidence somewhere in  
that predictable contest. We still cannot  
take men on in their own territory, where  
their rules go, and ours stay hidden or mis-  
understood.  

In parting, the Boss said, ""I don't have  
to listen to you because you're atypical,  
coming here and talking to me like this.""  

I said, equally in parting, ""If I had been  
typical, and not come to talk to you, then  
you'd have to listen to me? Is that what  
you mean?""  

""Yes, that's about it.""  

And so it was.

Psycho-Historian:

History’s Muse Reveals 19th
Century Women’s Rebellions

BY MARY HASTINGS

The liberation of Clio, muse of history,
and Sigmund Freud has loosened the grasp of
male chauvinism on the study of history and
psychiatry.

Carroll Rosenberg, psychiatrist and historian,
traced the roots of women's rebellion
against male control to Victorian America in
the second lecture of the ""Feminism in Amer-
ican Intellectual Life"" series.

Rosenberg, a ""psycho-historian"" special-
izing in 19th century American history,
addressed approximately 150 persons at 8 p.m.
January 31 in the University of Minnesota's
Murphy Hall Auditorium.

She is on the staff of the University of
Pennsylvania.

Rosenberg conceded that she began her
studies as a general social historian, not a
feminist.

But then she ""came across the Women's
Moral Reform Society of New York."" In the
activities of this Society, Rosenberg found
repudiation of the ""male slant"" on history
and psychiatry.

Rosenberg declared that the ""strength and
tenacity of sexual roles in society"" has far-
ranging effects on history and psychoanalytic
theories.

She admitted that this was a ""rash"" con-
cept in the academic world but the power re-
cumbent in the Women's Moral Reform Society
made her re-evaluate the male point of view
in history.

""Historians have traditionally viewed the
Women's Moral Reform Society as amusing,
Quixotic or neurotic,"" she noted.

But the organization fulfilled a number
of female needs in the 19th century—a per-
iod of major change in women's roles, when
they were moving to urban areas and begin-
ning to seek roles outside their homes and
families.

The Reform Society was an outgrowth of
the 19th century's philanthropic, religious
movement, which ""showed a deep-seated anger
toward men.""

The Society offered women an exclusively
female group, which demonstrated female sol-
idarity. It provided a newspaper for comm-
unication among women and allowed them to
""save male sinners,"" thus giving them an
opportunity to control male behavior.

By the 1840s and 1850s, the Society had
chapters in most states of the Union.

Carroll Rosenberg

With Clio freed from the strictures of
male history, Rosenberg dealt with the lib-
eration of Sigmund Freud and the violence
done to women by the 19th century concept of
acceptable female behavior.

Freud's model for the libido was a male
model, Rosenberg said. ""Although his first
and most important patients were women, he
based his theories on his own insights rath-
er than on those of his female patients.""
Because of Freud's concepts, for three-quar-
ters of a century women have been viewed as
variants from a male model.

""They have been characterized by passivi-
ty, masochism, narcissism and envy,"" Rosen-
berg added. ""Only through child-bearing and
rearing could women be fulfilled.""

Today, psychiatrists are starting to ask
new questions, largely because of the Women's
Movement,"" she continued.

One of the most important new questions
being asked centers on the question of hys-
teria as female role socialization in the 19th"

century America.

""Hysteria was considered to be a quintessentially female disease, linked to the reproductive system. It had an infinity of symptoms with no physical basis.""

Rosenberg suggested that hysteria may have been a protest against the traditional role of women in the Victorian era.

""Women chose to be sick instead of overtly deviant."" But doctors displayed a significant level of hostility toward hysterics. ""They felt women weren't acting as women should—the doctors were baffled as physicians and men.”

How did hysteria relate to the way 19th century women were raised?

""Many 19th century women reached maturity retaining a child-woman mentality; women were discouraged from displaying competition or mastery of 'male' skills. Overt anger and violence were forbidden to women.

These strictures resulted in women having weak ego structures and forced them into menial functions.

""Such character formation would be considered dysfunctional in a man,"" Rosenberg noted.

Because of the weak ego structures of many 19th century women, they often adopted hysterical behavior patterns to deal with stress.

Rosenberg dealt with one final issue previously obscured by the male historical viewpoint: The question of intimate friendships

“Choisir” Leaders to Participate in

International Women’s

Women throughout the world will gather in New York City Saturday, March 19 for a solidarity meeting in observance of International Women's Day.

Claude Servan-Schreiber, French journalist for ""Le Monde"", will attend the meeting. Giselle Halimi, leader of ""Choisir"", a French abortion rights group, and defender of Marie-Claire Chevalier, will also attend. Marie-Claire is a 16-year-old French girl who was recently tried for undergoing an abortion. Marie-Claire's mother, Michelle Chevalier, a defendant in the trial, will participate in the Solidarity meeting.

Barbara Mutnik, staff member of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition in New York City, said she expects 500 to 800 persons to attend the meeting.

between members of the same sex in the 19th century.

""Some critics have called these friendships latently homosexual,” Rosenberg said. ""But they have not taken 19th century structures into account. A study of such friendships can help us to understand bisexuality and homosexuality.""

Rosenberg explained that there was a widespread, culturally accepted behavior pattern of intense friendships between members of the same sex in the 19th century. She focused on intense friendships between women.

""Correspondence could play a large role in women's emotional lives at that time.

An emotionally viable female world emerges from these letters, in which men play only a shadow role."" Nineteenth-century women lived in an all-female world and men even more so in an all-male world.

Relations between the sexes were difficult because of sexual taboos.

She noted that the 19th century pattern of intense friendships could help us to view sexuality as a continuum affected by social norms and cultural environment.

""The 19th century permitted easy movement across these sexual boundaries.""

Rosenberg interprets such friendships in light of Freud's belief in all people's bisexuality and the sexual nature of all love.

As paradoxical as it may seem, Rosenberg concluded, perhaps the Victorian sexual structure was more supportive of individuals than our sexual mores. The third lecture of the series will be February 14 in Murphy Hall Auditorium. Sociologist Jacquelyne Jackson will speak on the relation of Black women to the dominant society and to feminism. All lectures are free and open to the public.

Solidarity Meeting

She added that such national women's movement leaders as Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug have been invited to participate.

The meeting will center on the international struggle for abortion rights. Mutnik said participants can also use the meeting as an opportunity to draw together reports about how the Supreme Court decision on abortion is being implemented throughout the country.

The March 10 meeting will convene in lieu of a previously planned weekend-long International Abortion Tribunal.

The sea-green color that corresponds  
to the twelfth zodiacal sign could  
readily signify the envy which Piscean  
women inspire in their sisters.

But women born under the sign of the  
fish are more cursed than blessed by  
its astrological influence, for Pis-  
ces women satisfy our cultural re-  
quirements of ""femininity"" from the  
moment they open their liquid eyes.

Born under a sign not given to self-  
assertion, the Pisces woman is neither  
inwardly goaded nor outwardly guided  
to self-knowledge.

Pisces of both sexes are often lan-  
guid, purposeless beings, better  
dreamers than achievers, better poets  
than physicists. Alas for the Pisces  
man, for our society demands that men  
deny those tender qualities that char-  
acterize this sign; many a Pisces man  

has escaped into drink, drugs or self-

deprecation from this social pressure.  
Alas too for the Pisces woman, for her  
insidious conditioning merely rein-  
forces the worst traits of her signs:  
indecision, escapism, delusion, ro-  
manticism, qualities encouraged if not  
treasured by our society in its women.

With this negative reinforcement it  
is difficult for the Pisces woman to  
discover her potential and fulfill it.  
The sign's admirable qualities--imagination,  
empathy, self-transcendence--  
are so easily confused with its dele-  
terious traits that the Pisces woman,  
driven neither by inward nor outward  
demands, may never distinguish the pos-  
itive manifestations from the negative.

If Pisceans often evoke envy from  
other women, they must conversely be-

Piscean women often fail to understand

Pisces is too often a victim looking  
to claim as ""woman's place.""

In this light it is instructive to  
consider Anais Nin's diaries. The Pis-  
ces writer was long in recognizing her  
own complex motivations; she enjoyed  
masculine acclaim for her ""femininity,""  
even considering herself the mythic  
woman men told her she was. The slow  
painful mergence of self in Nin's  
diaries should prove an inspiring les-  
son for the Pisces woman.

Other women born under this twelfth  
zodiacal sign include Angelina Grimke,  
Edna St. Vincent Millay, Emma Willard,  
Mary Lyon, Rosa Luxemburg, and Eliza-  
beth Barrett Browning."

Northwestern Hospital, while  
Nora Shroeder of Mt. Sinai em-  
phasizes that “we will work  
with private physicians connec-  
ted with the hospital.""  

Most other local hospitals  
have not yet announced their  
abortion policies.  

Recognizing that ""most women  
would rather stay here,"" Ms.  
Johnson of WCS points out,  
""There's an overload here al-  
ready. Minneapolis doctors are  
not yet experienced in the pro-

women who need salines or D&Cs  
(mid-pregnancy abortions) to

weeks we're still referring to  
New York.""  

Welfare Pays,  
Blue Cross  
Hesitates...  

Women on welfare can have  
abortions without cost, but  
women covered by Blue Cross  
health insurance cannot.  

Executive Jim Keeler of Blue  
Cross has no comment as to that  
major health insurance agency's  
stand on abortion coverage,  
calling it “a volatile issue""  
and commenting that ""the matter  
is under exhaustive study.""  

However, a Feb. 8 directive  
from assistant director Frank  
Palmer of the welfare department  
read in part, ""In inquiries re-  
ceived from recipients or from  
the medical community in refer-  
ence to payment for abortions,  
the staff response will be that  
abortion is a matter between  
the client and her physician.  

""If the physician recommends  
abortion,"" the statement con-  
tinues, “and we are billed for  
this medical service by a lis-  
censed medical vendor or medi-  
cal facility, payment will be  
made from Title 19 (Medicaid)  
fund.""  

Welfare recipients, including  
women receiving Aid to Families  
with Dependent Children (AFDC),  
will be referred to welfare  
department counseling services  
should they seek abortion coun-  
seling, the statement further  
states.  

Despite the recent Supreme  
Court ruling allowing abortions  
up to six months after concep-  
tion, women in the Twin Cities  
will find prices high, doctors  
inexperienced and hospital reg-  
ulations obstructive, a recent  
survey showed.  

Three counseling services  
revealed that they will contin-  
ue to provide referrals to wom-  
en in need of abortions, al-  
though some will be advised to  
seek such medical aid in an-  
other state.  

""Things are changing so fast,""  
says Pam Johnson of the Women's  
Counseling Service, while Paula  
Wendt of Abortion Counseling  
Service says, ""The Supreme  
Court Decision took us all by  
surprise.""  

Both services--WCS at 827-  
3819 and ACS at 545-8085--  
are referring callers to local  
physicians associated with a  
hospital which provides facil-  
ities for pregnancy termina-  
tion.  

""But we are still referring  
about ten women a week out of  
state,” says Ms. Wendt. “We pro-  
bably receive 50-60 calls a  
week. Before the law was changed  
we saw that many women person-  
ally each week, but we aren't  
keeping a record of the number  
of phone referrals now.""  

* Abortion Counseling Service,  
one of the first such agencies  

in the state, will close after  

the ""transitional period,"" Ms.  

Wendt disclosed.  

Women's Counseling Service  
is still referring many callers  
to clinics in New York or other  
states with liberal abortion  
laws. According to Ms. Johnson,  
""It is still cheaper for many  
women to go to New York, parti-  
cularly under 12 weeks. We pro-  
vide about 20 referrals a week  
to New York clinics. The price  
is about $100 there, plus trans-  
portation--a total of about $217  
if you fly standby.""  

She compares this to the $225  
announced price for abortions  
at Twin Cities hospitals.  

Another local counseling  
service, Planned Parenthood,  
will “maintain the referral  
policy for those who elect to  
have abortions,"" says executive  
director Thomas Weber. ""And  
we will watch closely as health  
facilities begin to provide this  
service. After the health sys-  
tem decides what it will do, we  
will assess the care offered  
against Planned Parenthood  
standards and then make decisi-  
ons about local referrals.""  

Weber says that Planned Par-  
enthood is still providing out-  
of-state referrals at this time.  

Several local hospitals, in-  
cluding Abbott-Northwestern,  
Hennepin General, and Mt. Sinai,  
have recently announced that  
they will provide facilities  
for doctors to perform abor-  
tions. ""We are prepared to

our medical staff who ask for

""The wheel that creaks  
most gets the most oil,""  
Mary Manning of the U.S.  
Department of Labor told  
an audience of 150 women at  
last week's Equal Employment  

Rights Workshop. ""Women  
must be knowledgeable about  
their rights, and make  
others knowledgeable.  
Otherwise we'll be put on  
the back burner for years.""  

Ms. Manning, Regional Dir-  
ector of the Department's  
Women's Division, charged  
that women “are losing  
ground, not gaining it,""  
in the struggle for equal  
employment rights, noting  
that ""40 percent of cases  
involving employment dis-  
crimination are brought in  
regards to sex discrimina-  
tion.""  

Ms. Manning was keynote  
speaker at the Model City  
sponsored employment work-  
shop, held on January 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center.  
She described the cultural  
conditioning that “makes  
women show their hemlines  
but not their brains. To  

be intelligent or highly  
educated is unfeminine,  
though studies show that  
brain power is equally dis-  
tributed between the sexes.  
What is not equally distrib-  
uted is use of brain power.""  
Ms. Manning maintained that  
women must take responsibil-  
ity for their career ad-  
vancement. “Women have  
waited for too long for Sir  
Galahad to come and save  
them--have waited, been stu-  
pid and been very quiet.""  
She suggested that women  
make use of their legal pre-  
rogatives, for ""if manage-  
ment can say that women  
don't care, the laws won't  
amount to much.""  

Joan Munday, Federal Women's  
Program coordinator for the  
U.S. Department of Housing  
and Urban Development (HUD),  
described federal affirma-  
tive action regulations,  
pointing out that ""the re-  
sponsibility for action  
falls on those most affected  
by job discrimination.""  

“The role of women employees  
is therefore more than just  
doing their job,"" Ms. Munday  
asserted. ""We must make  
things more equal for our-  
selves, our co-workers, and  
all women who apply for jobs  
at our company.""  
Federal regulations demand

Nonmethods  
of Contraception  

The following section de-  
scribes several methods that  
traditionally have been used  
to prevent conception, but  
whose failure rate is high  
enough to make them impracti-  
cal for people serious about  
practicing contraception.  
These “nonmethods"" have a  
small advantage over using  
no contraception whatever,  
but they are poor substitutes  
for the more effective means  
discussed previously.  

Coitus Interruptus  

There exist three kinds of  
male-controlled contraceptive  
methods, all of which depend  
on the male's preventing the  
entrance of semen into the  
vagina during intercourse.  
In coitus interruptus, the  
male withdraws his penis  
from the vagina and vaginal  
area just before his orgasm  
and ejaculates outside of,  
and away from, the vagina.  
One disadvantage of this  
technique is its limited ef-  
fectiveness. Pregnancy may  
result, because sperm can en-  
ter the vagina in the follow-  
ing ways.  

1. Ejaculation in stages or  
withdrawal after some  
sperm has been released  
in the vagina. It is  
possible for a small a-  
mount of sperm to be re-  
leased in the lubricant  
secreted from the penis  
prior to and during in-  
tercourse. The male may  
not be aware of this.  

2. Failure of some men to  
withdraw in time, due to  
either carelessness or  
lack of ability to pre-  
dict time of orgasm.  

3. Ejaculation near the wo-

remain alive under the

Apart from its being an in-

chologists question the  
psychic and physical effects  
on both partners of coitus

time her partner must with-  
draw. Men also experience  
anxiety over their own con-  
trol and perhaps feel cheated  
of the full pleasure of an  
orgasm within the vagina.  

There exist two related  
techniques, neither of which  
is recommended as being eith-  
er effective or rewarding.  
Coitus reservatus is a method  
in which the male maintains  
an erection until his partner  
has an orgasm and then with-  
draws without having ejacula-  
ted. The second technique,  
coitus obstructus, calls for

firm pressure with fingers  
at the base of the penis at  
the moment of ejaculation,  
thus channeling the semen in-  
to the man's bladder rather  
than into his partner's va-  
gina.  

Rhythm  

The rhythm method of con-  
traception requires absti-  
nence from sexual inter-  
course during the woman's  
fertile period. While the  
efficiency of this method  
is lower than the others al-  
ready discussed, its use is  
better than no contraceptive  
practice at all. The major  
difficulty in using the  
rhythm method is correctly  
determining the time of the  
fertile period. It is advis-  
able to have a physician's  
assistance in this endeavor,  
but for those who want to go  
it alone, below is a brief  
outline of how to determine  
safe and unsafe times. A  
couple may use either of two  
methods, the calendar method  
or the basal body tempera-  
ture method. Both require  
record keeping for a long  
period in advance (several  
months to a year) in order  
to establish the individual  
patterns of menstruation and  
ovulation.  

Calendar Method. To prac-  
tice this method, a woman  

must maintain a record for a

swimming into the vagina.  
This can and does happen,  
even when the woman has nev-

This is the standard chart for the rhythm 23  
method, as prescribed by doctors for many 24  

years.  

To use this chart, a woman should 25  

keep a record of her menstrual cycles for a 26  

year, counting the day on which menstruation  

27  

begins as the first day of each period. 28  
Knowing the number of days in her shortest 29  
and longest cycles, she can find her first 30  

and last unsafe days from the chart.  

Thus,  

for example, a woman whose shortest period in 32  

the past year has been twenty-four days is  

safe until the sixth day of each new period; 34  
if her longest period during the past year 35  
has been twenty-eight days, she becomes safe 36  
again after the seventeenth day of each new 37  

period.

year to determine the length  
of her longest and her short-  

est menstrual cycles. She  
can then use the chart (Table  
3) presented here to deter-  
mine which days are ""unsafe.""  
For example, if her shortest  
cycle during the year lasted  
25 days and her longest  
lasted 31, the first unsafe  
day (counting from the first  
day of menstruation) would  

be the seventh and the last  
unsafe day would be the  
twentieth. Thus, it would  

be necessary for her to ab-  
stain from intercourse, or  

to use some other contracep-  
tive method, for the two-  
week period. The length of  
time abstention is required  
is directly related to the  
degree of irregularity in  

the menstrual cycle. About  
15 percent of all women have  
cycles so irregular that  

they cannot use the rhythm  
method at all.  

Basal Body Temperature  
Method. This method is bas-  
ed on the fact that the re-  
lease of a ripe egg is as-  
sociated with a slight de-  
crease in body temperature.  

A day or two after the egg  

is released, the temperature  
rises again to 0.5-1.0 de-  
gree above normal. The temp-  
erature then remains the  

same until the next menstrual  
period. (See Figure 5.) If  
the woman waits until three  
days after the temperature  
rise has taken place, she  
can be sure that the egg has  
decomposed and that it is  
safe to have sexual relations  
for the duration of the  
cycle. It should be noted,  
however, that the temperature  
reading must be taken at  
about the same time every  
morning, before the woman  
gets out of bed or is active.  
Slight physiological changes,  
such as illness or nervous-  
ness, and sleeping under an  
electric blanket can affect  
the reading. Because the  
difference in temperature is  
slight, use of a special BBT  
thermometer is advised.  

Disadvantages of the rhy-  
thm method are: (a) a lack  
of effectiveness: if a hun-

the sperm are in the uterus,  
they cannot be washed away.  
Therefore, the effective-  

ness of douching as a con-  
traceptive is so low as to  
make it almost useless.**  

In fact, a douche actually  
can have the opposite of the  
desired effect: the pres-  
sure of the liquid may force  
sperm into the opening of  
the cervix. If a diaphragm  
or a vaginal spermicide has  
been used, a douche can  
neutralize the protective  
value and therefore should  
not be used until six to  
eight hours after inter-  
course.  

Douching is not necessary  
for vaginal hygiene. The  
vagina keeps itself clean  
through normal vaginal dis-  
charge.

Chippie

By K/T

“Hey, baby, break it up:  
I said break it UP!""

Pushing aside people gathered around the two women, B.D. grabbed Katie's arms, restraining her from lashing out again at Linda.

""Break it up,"" she repeated, quieter this time, holding Katie a few moments longer while Linda and her friends left the bar. Assured that the fight was over, for now anyway, B.D. gently patted the crying Katie on the shoulder and left her with another woman.

And Katie's cries of ""But I LOVED that woman: I LOVED HER!"" were nonchalantly accepted by the Saturday night crowd as a common reaction to another broken affair. It happened every week. Women might be different. But there were always broken affairs, jealous lovers, and an occasional fight.

And B.D., or ""Big Daddy,"" knew how to handle just about anything that might happen. She'd been bartending at the Seafish Lounge for the past twelve years and commanded the respect of everyone who frequented it.

""Hey babe! How ya' doing tonight?"" she yelled to a group of women who had just noisily entered. All loudly greeted B.D. as they searched for other familiar faces in the dimly-lit room.

One of them slowly made her way through the women standing and sitting around the bar to finally reach a seat in the corner that seemed to be waiting for her.

She was about thirty years old and carried herself with a quiet assurance.

Pausing briefly from mixing drinks, B.D. looked up, then leaned over the counter to kiss her lightly on the lips with a ""Hi, babe.""

Both talked to each other a few seconds before B.D. continued to make drinks for the ever-increasing number of women coming in.

Earlier that night somebody had asked her if she was in love. She replied with a very negative shake of her head, and noncommittedly added: ""She's growing on me, though."" B.D.'s most recent affair with Pat had been going on for just two weeks.

Now Pat observed B.D. as she performed behind the bar. ""She's beautiful people,"" said those who knew B.D., and Pat's eyes reflected that thought as she watched her.

B.D. was at her best tonight... Saturday nights, the busiest nights, always seemed to bring out whatever it was that made her friends comment: ""B.D., you're cool."" She never forgot a name of anyone who came in, never forgot what they drank, and never forgot to greet anyone with a grin, or a ""Hi, babe, how ya' doing?""

Saturday nights were B.D.'s most interesting and wild nights. They were the nights she drank the most, danced the most, smoked the most, and laughed the most. She was laughing now, as she sang along with a song blaring from the jukebox.

Head thrown back, hands cupped under her large, firm breasts, B.D. was singing: ""Babe, I do the BEST THAT I CAN!"" in a laughing, infectious voice that captured the attention of everyone in the bar. As the song ended, B.D. laughingly accepted the loud, good-natured applause given her by the women who shared and acknowledged the meanings of B.D.'s gestures.

At 2:00 A.M., ten minutes from now, B.D. got off work, and she began to turn the bar over to Sue, who worked the morning shift. Actually, the name “Big Daddy"" was a name given B.D. as a joke. She was only 4'10"" tall.

But with B.D.'s short haircut, and tough, firm stockiness, the name fit.

Having given last directions to Sue, B.D. handed Pat her purse, took her own billfold, briskly combed her hair, and walked from her place behind the bar to sit and relax beside Pat before walking to Sally's, another bar only a block away.

B.D. liked certain things at Sally's that the Seafish didn't provide: the pool table, the bowling machine, her favorite song ""Amber Light."" Most of B.D.'s friends spent Saturday nights walking from Sally's to the Seafish, from the Seafish to Sally's.

""Ready to go?"" B.D. asked Pat, as she put out her cigarette, and glanced questioningly at her. Pat nodded. B.D. led the way to the door, yelled her good night to everyone and Pat followed her out.

""Amber Light"" was playing as they walked into Sally's. B.D. took Pat's hand, led her to an open place on the floor, and started dancing. One hand encircled Pat's shoulder, the other held Pat's hand closely to her breast. The slow strains of ""Amber Light"" enveloped B.D. and Pat and seemed to soften and warm Sally's sinister, dark, and smoke-filled atmosphere.

Bells from both the pinball and bowling machines, pool balls cracking sharply against one another, a marijuana scent filtering from the women's bathroom, ice clanking against the sides of glasses, murmurs, cries, laughs from liquor-perfumed breath—all were sounds and smells that filled and pervaded the room every Saturday night.

As ""Amber Light"" ended, B.D. and Pat walked to the counter, ordered drinks, and began their “weekend drinking."" ""Rock 'n Swing"" vibrated through the air now—a fast, hard tune—keeping them awake, moving, drinking, until later, much later in the morning, when they would finally leave the bars and go home to recover from their Saturday night drunken activeness.

No song played from the  
jukebox now. And the stolid  
silence pervaded, permeated,  
everything in the room.  
Standing alone in the corner  
was the pinball machine, its  
lights sending oddly shaped  
shadows to dance and flicker  
eerily on the walls.  

She was sitting there,  
slowly smoking a cigarette,  
an empty Coke glass on the  
counter beside her. Her  
face was expressionless, but  
her half-closed eyes hinted  
at the depth of her weariness.  

Occasionally the stillness  
was broken by a low comment  
from one of the persons  
seated by the counter. Few  
people were there now. And  
all seemed to be absorbed in  
their own, individual  
thoughts.  

All except Billy, who de-  
cided to begin his nightly  
teasing.  

""Hey, B.D.,"" he said jok-  
ingly, ""Get any pussy last  
night?""  

She turned to look at him,  
then replied: ""Billy, fuck  
off,"" in a half-irritated,  
half-amused voice.  

Unperturbed, he continued,  
""B.D., you gonna chippie on  
her? She give you enough  
pussy?""  

""Billy, FUCK OFF,"" she  
replied, sharper this time.  
Getting up from her stool,  
she walked over to him,  
hands on hips, and glared  
into his chuckling face.  

""Watch yourself, Billy,""  
she said warningly, ""You're  
already barred from Sally's,  
you know.""  

""Aw, B.D.,"" said Billy  
plaintively, ""I was only  
kidding.""  

Then he paused, only to  
look up at her a moment lat-  
er with a grin on his face.  

""Ya' still love me, B.D.?""  
he softly teased.  

""I'd love you more if you  
you'd shut your motherfuck-  
ing mouth!"" grumbled B.D.  

But Billy knew she wasn't  
angry with him. She rarely  
got more than slightly ir-  
ritated with his usual harm-  
less banter and he knew how  
far he could go with his  
joking.  

""Hey, B.D.""  

""NOW what the hell do you  
want, Billy?""  

""Trust me for a beer, will  
ya?""  

""BILLY!"" she yelled, faking  
her anger with him again.  
Then she looked at him, her  
eyes slightly twinkling, en-  
joying the mock fight be-  
tween them.  

""Billy, you know I don't  
trust anybody but myself,""  
she stated.  

""Nobody?"" he asked, half-  
seriously.  

B.D. looked at him a long  
time, then finally turned a-  
way.  

""Nope, Billy, only my-  
self,"" she said, almost in-  
audibly, her eyes toward the  
window, gazing into the dark  
night beyond.  

Everyone had left the bar  
by closing time. And B.D.  
put out her last cigarette  
for the night. She automati-  
cally, almost mechanically,  
emptied the ashtrays, then  
rinsed out glasses left on  
the counter. She looked at  
the clock. 2:00 A.M. A  
faintly discernible sigh  
escaped from her as she  
looked around, before walk-  
ing out the door and lock-  
ing it. Another Tuesday  
night at the Seafish was  
over.

Anthropologist Elaine Mor-
gan has written a book de-
tailing her theories about
human evolution. Her ideas
are marked by refreshing
clarity and insightful cur-
iosity. This is in marked
contrast to books by most
male anthropologists, whose
premises seem to be based on
the common preconception that
all results of human evolu-
tion occurred either for the
purpose of making the Mighty
Hunter mightier or to make
the sex object sexier. Mor-
gan states, ""The longer I
went on reading his own book
books about himself, the
more I longed to find a vol-
ume that would begin: ‘When
the first ancestor of the hu-
man race descended from the
trees, she had not yet devel-
oped the mighty brain that
was to distinguish her so
sharply from all other spe-
cies.'""

The Descent
of Woman

Morgan explores the one-
sidedness of most anthropo-
logy, beginning with a dis-
cussion of androcentric
speech, and leads into the
manly myths that dominate
the science.

She disputes the idea that
""woman is a distorted ver-
sion of the original blue-
print.”

For example—most male
anthropologists agree that
men became bipedal for pur-
poses of speed in the hunt,
even though quadrupeds run
faster than bipeds. Morgan
maintains that with the
drought of the 12-million
Pliocene era, the prehomin-
ids, former tree-dwellers,
took to the sea for protec-
tion when there were no more
trees to climb. They stood
upright to keep their heads
above water.

The Pliocene era is a
blank page in history; there
is little archeological ev-
idence pointing out where
prehominids were during that
time. Morgan submits that
they became sea dwellers.
There is little evidence be-
cause the weapons, pebbles,
were common on the beach and
worn by the water, and bones
washed to the sea.

Further evidence is that
we lost our furry hair to
aid rapid swimming (we would
have needed it to protect
our tender skin on land).

Also, we developed layers of
subcutaneous fat to keep us
warm in the water (it would
have added to the unbearable
heat on land). Similar hair
and fat evolution can be
seen in other mammals: the
walrus, porpoise, and hippo.

The reason she gives for
long hair remaining on the
human's head is that the
head would be the only part
of the body out of the water
and exposed to the sun; also,
a baby could grasp the mo-
ther's long hair and float
in the water.

Morgan explains why wo-
man developed larger
breasts than their primate
ancestors: with the loss
of chest hair, children
would have nothing to

hang onto. Babies whose
mother's breasts were lar-
ger survived more often,
and that physical trait be-
gan to predominate. We did
not develop larger breasts
to attract the Mighty Hunt-
er!

That idea, as she says,
is ""a circular argument...
It's like saying that a wo-
man walks with a wiggle be-
cause this is attractive to
a male. In fact, she only
walks with a wiggle because
her children are so intell-
igent. The necessity of
passing a large-skulled in-
fant's head through her pel-
vic ring has prevented her
skeleton from adapting to
bipedalism quite as grace-
fully as that of her bro-
thers; and males only find
this defect attractive be-
cause they associate it with
femininity.""

Other traits developed as
our aquatic visit length-
ened: webbing between fin-
gers and toes (we still have
vestigial webbing between
thumb and forefinger). Our
noses became streamlined to
keep out excess water. We
developed tear glands to

secrete salt. The ability
to frown began to protect our
eyes from the glare of
the sun on the water. 
Something else happened—

we developed large buttocks.
Contrary to androcentric
thinking, it was not for the
purpose of sexual attraction.
Females would sit on the
beach to nurse their babies.
The fatty tissue built up
and the vaginal orifice
moved in and forward for
protection from the sand.
This point introduces
three interesting chapters
in the book: orgasm, love,
and aggression. Morgan says
that as the buttocks built
up, the male could no longer
reach the vagina in the nor-
mal rear-mounting position.
In order to achieve coitus,
he had to switch to a front-
al approach. This had two
immediate consequences: the
female was terrified; and
she was unable to reach or-
gasm. Her body was designed
for sexual approaches from
the rear; a frontal approach
was understood as an attack.
Her sexual initiative was
met by violence and she was
confused.

Also, the penis was no
longer entering the vagina
at the best angle to
""scratch the itch,"" and she
experienced sexual frustra-
tion for the first time.
The third result of the
switch to the frontal ap-
proach: sex and aggression
became linked in the human
mind. For the male, sex
became associated with ag-
gression, for the female,
with terror. Also, more
aggressive males had more
offspring since they
achieved coitus more often,
and aggression spread in
the species.

Morgan concludes her book
with several chapters in
which she traces facts of
everyday life to prehistory
things like race memory,
the development of speech,
sex roles, the Tarzan myth,
and differences in politi-
cal inclinations of the
sexes. The last chapter
sums it all up with her
“state of the movement""
evaluation. She ends on a
hopeful note:

""It may be that for Homo
sapiens in the future, ex-
treme manifestations of the

triple bind. She is the  
minority of the minority of  
the minority. She is first  
a woman, then a gay, and  
then a mother. The need to  
relate to the life-style of  
raising children is great  
and immediate. This is why  
the group was started. We  
need support from women who  
are mothers and women who  
are relating to children.  
We need lawyers and other  
people who will rap with us.  
We need the moral support of  
others like us and the sup-  
port of other gay sisters.  

How does the lesbian be-  
come a mother? The same way  
any other woman becomes a  
mother. Some of us were  
married and came out after  
our marriages. Some of us  
gave life to children  
because families and society  
expected us to do this.  
Some of us wanted children--  
we never married but we  
surrounded ourselves with children.  
Some of us were raped and  
some of us just didn't know  
any better. Whatever the  
reasons, we are here. We  
have chosen to have children  
and we feel that we are fit  
mothers. We have fears and  
pain and joys and successes.  
We want to show the world  
that we are not unfit moth-  
ers because we are lesbians.  
We want our children to  
grow up and be free to  
choose their own life-style  
and not be poisoned by a  
bigoted society. Our child-  
ren will know pain just as  
we know pain but that is how  
we grew and that is how they  
will grow.  

If you are interested in  
relating to children in any  
way, whether you are a moth-  
er, the lover of a mother,  
whatever you are, we want  
you. Join our group and  
help us and we'll help you.  
We meet on Tuesday evenings  
at 8:00 at 2314 Elliot Ave-  
nue South, Minneapolis.  

Some of the gay women from  
the Resource Center have  
been babysitting for our  
kids while we rap so feel  
free to bring your kids.  

The Elliot Ave. address is  
a neutral meeting ground.  
There is no label attached  
to coming there. There are  
many lesbian mothers in the  
area who are afraid to come  
to a place that labels them  
as lesbians for one reason  
or another and we understand  
that.  

Some of you are frightened  
and we can feel that fright.  
We know it is painful, but  
we need you and we can all  
help each other if only we  
can meet and talk.  

If for any reason you can-  
not come to us I would like  
to give you my phone number.  
Call on me if you want more  
information or if you just  
need to talk. My phone num-  
ber is 722-1519.  

Here's hoping we will see  
you at our meetings.

at times, watching an ex-

It's about time we quit

WEAL FILES SUIT

30 Metro School Districts Charged
With Failure to Hire Women Teachers

Ellen Dresselhuis, President of the Minnesota Divi- 
sion of Women's Equity Ac- 
tion League (WEAL) announced 
this week that WEAL in con- 
junction with Susan B. An- 
thony's birthday, Feb. 15, 
has filed suit with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) against 30 
in 32 school districts of Minnesota, 
charging sex discrimination in the 
employment of senior high 
school teachers. Duplicate complaints 
have been filed with the U.S. 
Department of Health, Education, 
and Welfare (HEW). On the basis 
of research done by WEAL, it found that 
1/3 of the school districts in the 
metropolitan area have no females 
in their senior high social studies 
departments, 1/3 have fewer than 
10%, and the remaining 1/3 have 
10-38%. Only two school districts 
(West St. Paul and South St. Paul) 
have female representation in senior 
high social studies.

The percentage of women hired as 
senior high social studies teachers 
does not reflect the availability of 
women for these positions. In 1972, 
at the Sees (continued from page 12) 
placement and registered with the 
Placement Service were female. 
At Mankato, 23% were female. 
At St. Cloud, he will begin to shed them 
behavior patterns of dominance and 
aggression will be evolutionarily at a 
discount; and if that happens, he will 
begin to shed them.

Copies of the complaint have been sent 
to Howard Casmey, Minnesota 
Commissioner of Education, with a 
letter stating that the Minnesota 
State Board of Education's pamphlet 
""Eliminating Sex Bias in Education: 
A Policy and Proposed Action"" has 
not been acted upon and that a 
definite affirmative action program 
should be pursued to ensure equal 
opportunity for women and men, 
and girls and boys.

Forget it,"" she says, ""unless it's some 
rat-infested, roach-infested dump, then 
it's okay."" Finances are an omnipresent 
problem to Sally, as to other AFDC mothers. 
""Welfare discourages women from going 
out to work. You can't make enough on 
your own to raise your family,"" she 
says. ""If you work, you probably can't 
earn more than you'd get on AFDC."" 
As for social life, ""you just hang it 
up,"" Sally says. ""You don't see people 
at work, you don't have money to go out. 
If your friends aren't on AFDC, their 
husbands might not want them to associate 
with you. You can just about forget about 
having a social life. 

""People get so concerned about the 
money spent on welfare. Well, I wonder 
about all the money spent on that war.""

I hear lots of men saying  
there's no humor in the wo-  
men's movement. They seem  
to think that when a woman  
becomes a feminist, she for-  
gets how to laugh.  

That propaganda is another  
boring example of male opaci-  
ty and American double-think.  
It is, in fact, the women's  
movement that allows us to  
laugh. Men who mourn the  
dearth of humor are too dense  
to know when they're being  
laughed at.  

In the old days before the  
second wave, women had one  
alternative to choose from in  
responding to her situation:  
insanity. Thinking women did  
go insane: Sylvia Plath at  
one extreme, and women who  
resigned themselves to the  
quiet madness of everyday  
life at the other. Psycholo-  
gists still accord qualities  
of an unbalanced person to a  
""normal woman""—dependence,  
weakness. Now, the women's  
movement encourages a second  
alternative: laughter.  

Humor lies in the incongru-  
ity of situations. During a  
recent TV documentary on H.L.  
Mencken the narrator said,  
""Sally's (the college English  
professor Mencken married) in-  
telligence was very real—but  
so was her femininity!"" Some  
jokes, such as the poster of  
Golda Meir entitled ""But can  
she type?"" take a sadly com-  
mon situation and carry its  
incongruity one step further  
into humor. Everyone knows  
women who hold master's deg-  
rees plus years of experience  

But can she type?  

who are stuck in secretarial  
positions. The joke about  
the want ad requesting a per-  
son who can walk on water and  
type 60 words per minute is  
by now an old one. Perhaps  
if males do not think those  
jokes are funny it is because  
they see no incongruity in  
those situations; after all,  
drudge work is woman's natur-  
al domain no matter how qual-  
ified she is.  

“Hire him.  
He’s got great legs.”  

Sometimes feminist humor  
ridicules situations common  
to women. By placing a male  
in a woman's situation, we  
see how ludicrous the situa-  

tion is. For example, the  
""Hire him. He's got great  
legs."" poster. A similar ex-  

ample was aired on the Mary  
Tyler Moore show recently.  
Resident oaf Ted Baxter wore  
a pair of platform shoes  
which gave him a precarious  
and awkward walk. The scene  
was the funniest of the whole  
show. I wonder how many peo-  
ple realized that it's just  
as ridiculous for women to  
wear such handicapping cloth-  
es—and by extension, dress-  
es, girdles (I saw an ad for  
girdles the other day, so I  
assume some women still wear  
them!) and to practice such  
self-mutilation as shaving  
and eyebrow-tweezing.  

""If Michelangelo had been  
a girl, her mother might have  
said, 'You draw nicely, dear.  
Now wash the shirts, give the  
baby his dinner, and sweep  
the kitchen for me, there's  
a good girl.'""  

Laughter is Powerful  

Men know the power of laugh-  
ter and have used it against  
women for centuries, making  
us ashamed of things to which  
no shame should be attached  
to keep us insecure and pow-  
erless. They made us ashamed  
of being strong, of being in-  
dependent, of having hair un-  
der our arms. Now that we  
have self-respect, we no long  
er laugh at those things. We  
do not admire the self-depre-  
cation of Lucille Ball, but  
turn rather to Lily Tomlin,  
who only does characters who  
like and respect themselves.  

Laughter is used as a wea-  
pon in the women's movement,  
too, to strip men of that mys-  
tical aura of power with  
which they surround themselv-  
es. A group of women talked  
recently about the difficulty  
of getting jobs, the insin-  
cerity of the business world,  
the way revealing one's true  
self would preclude any pos-  
sibility of employment. The  
discussion generated into a  
hilarious listing of ""How not  
to get a job."" The ideas  
ranged from wearing jeans to  
the interview to revealing  
one's involvement in radical  
feminism, each suggestion  
funnier and truer than the  
last. Finally a quiet woman  
said, ""Just take a copy of  
Lesbian Nation with you to  
the interview—you'd never  
get hired!""  

This comment would not be  
funny if it were not based on  
some very tragic facts: the  
stifling conformity of busi-  
ness and the blanket practice  
of discrimination against  
gays.  

On the other hand, this  
joke makes us forget for a  
moment the excessive power  
personnel recruiters wield  
and puts them into proper per-  
spective. You can't help  
seeing, in your mind's eye,  

a self-important, blue-suited  
male, mouth open, eyes roll-  
ing, and for once, speechless.  

And finally, if men cannot  
see beyond their usually sim-  
ple-minded and often cruel  
definitions of humor to the  
more mature women's humor, I  
must remind them that the  
women's movement was born of  
a truly unhappy situation.  

It is a serious attempt to  
eradicate unnecessary misery  
from human life. There is  
nothing funny about being  
oppressed.”"
GoldFlower,2,10,February 1974,3,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No10_page003.txt,"The National Black Feminist  
Organization held its first  
meeting in New York City in  
December. The information  
below expresses viewpoints  
from that conference.  

Statement  
of Purpose  

The distorted male-dominated  
media image of the Women's  
Liberation Movement has  
clouded the vital and revol-  
utionary importance of this  
movement to Third World wo-  
men, especially Black women.  
The Movement has been char-  
acterized as the exclusive  
property of so-called ""white  
middle class"" women and any  
Black women seen involved in  
this movement have been seen  
as ""selling out,"" ""dividing  
the race"" and an assortment  
of nonsensical epithets.  
Black Feminists resent these  
charges and have therefore  
established THE NATIONAL  
BLACK FEMINIST ORGANIZATION,  
in order to address ourselves  
to the particular and speci-  
fic needs of the larger, but  
almost cast aside half of the  
Black race in Amerikka, the  
Black Woman.  

Black women have suffered  
cruelly in this society from  
living the phenomenon of  
being Black and female, in a  
country that is both racist  
and sexist. There has been  
very little real examination  
of the damage it has caused  
on the lives and on the minds  
of Black women. Because we  
live in a patriarchy, we have  
allowed a premium to be put  
on Black male suffering. No  
one of us would minimize the  
pain or hardship or the cruel  
and inhumane treatment ex-  
perienced by the Black man.  
But history, past or present,  
rarely deals with the mali-  

cious abuse put upon Black  
women. We were seen as  
breeders by the master; de-  
spised and historically po-  
larized from/by the master's  
wife; and looked upon as  
castrators by our lovers and  
husbands. The Black woman  

has had to be strong, yet we  
are persecuted for having  

survived. We have been  
called ""matriarchs"" by white  
racists and Black nation-  
alists; we have virtually no  
positive self-images to vali-  
date our existence. Black  
women want to be proud, dig-  
nified and free from all  
those false definitions of  
beauty and womanhood that  
are unrealistic and unnatur-  
al. We, not white men or  
Black men, must define our  
own self-image as Black wo-  
men and not fall into the  
mistake of being placed upon  
the pedestal—which is even  
being rejected by white wo-  
men. It has been hard for  
Black women to emerge from  
the myriad of distorted imag-  
es that have portrayed us as  
grinning Beulahs, castrating  
Sapphires and pancake box  
Jemimahs. As Black Femin-  
ists we realized the need to  
establish ourselves as an  
independent Black Feminist  
organization. Our above  
ground presence will lend  
enormous credibility to the  
current Women's Liberation  
Movement, which unfortunate-  

ly is not seen as the  

serious political and econom-  
ic revolutionary force that  
it is. We will strengthen  
the current efforts of the  
Black Liberation struggle in  
this country by encouraging  
all of the talents and crea-  
tivities of Black women to  
emerge, strong and beautiful,  
not to feel guilty or divis-  
ive, and assume positions of  
leadership and honor in the  
Black community. We will  
encourage the Black communi-  
ty to stop falling into the  
trap of the white male Left,  
utilizing women only in terms  
of domestic or servile needs.  
We will continue to remind  
the Black Liberation Movement  
that there can't be libera-  
tion for half the race. We  
must together, as a people,  
work to eliminate racism from  
without the Black community  
which is trying to destroy us  
as an entire people, but we  
must remember that sexism is  
destroying and crippling us  
from within."

New Tomorrow

Audrey Colom Speaks  
To Minnesota Women’s  
Political Caucus  

BY SHIRLEY HEYER  

Audrey Colom, vice chair of the National  
Women's Political Caucus, spoke on the “Myth  
of Black Women and Feminism,"" at the annual  
meeting of the Minnesota Women's Political  
Caucus at Hamline University Nov. 17.  

""Feminist issues are clearly relevant to  
us,"" she said. ""Our double jeopardy--based  
on sex and race--places us at the bottom.  

""For example, the annual median income for  
individuals places black women at the  
bottom, white women third, black males sec-  
ond, and white males at the top.""  

In the struggle for equal rights, she  
said, ""We need to avoid the 'd&c' (divide  
and conquer) tactic.  

""The civil rights movement and the femin-  
ist movement are addressing the white male  
club--with all women and minority men at the  
bottom. We, all women and minority men, are  
the majority in this country.""  

The “myth” of black women and feminism,  
Ms. Colom said, is caused largely by false  
stereotypes, many of which are perpetuated  
by the media. These stereotypes are, she  
said:  

1) trying to ""divide our loyalties.  

Telling us that we are black first and  
women second, or as Margaret Sloan, black  
feminist from Chicago, said, ‘That means on  
Mondays through Wednesdays they'll mess you  
over because you're female and Thursdays  
through Sundays they'll mess you over be-  
cause you're black.""  

2) ""the women's movement is a middle-class  
movement. Some of us accept the stereotype  
that the women's liberation movement is  
‘middle-class women trying to escape the  
home.' We don't need to be liberated to escape  
the home. Work in the home and child care  
are valid. Who says liberation is getting  
up at five, taking care of the family, going  
to a job and then coming home to take care  
of the family again? This is not women's  
liberation.""  

3) ""the black woman's place is behind her  
man, pushing him into his manhood. ...32%  
of black families are headed by women.  
Where are the men they are supposed to push  
into manhood? Don't lay the emasculation of  
black men on us black women. Bobby Seale  
said, 'Real manhood is not the subjugation  
of anyone.'""  

4) ""this is a white/racist women's move-  
ment. A media cliché. The women's movement  
is actually as diverse as the black movement  
is. Just as there are sexists in the black  
liberation movement, there are racists in  
the women's liberation movement.  

""We need the Coalitions, such as the one  
between the Urban Coalition and NOW in the  
boycott against General Mills, or the action

MWPC's ""Minority  
Women’s Workshop Resolution  

Minority women agree that their economic  
and social status in American society dic-  
tate that an unrelenting focus and all pos-  
sible energies be directed toward employ-  
ment, education, prison reform, breaking the  
welfare cycle, the best of comprehensive  
day care facilities and personnel, unfair  
percentage of conscription into armed  
services all contribute toward their snail-  
like pace toward gaining their fair share of  
goods and services for their families, com-  
munities and themselves. Although they  
agree that the general goals of the MWPC are  
laudable and necessary to improve the gener-  
al status of women, they feel that their  
focus on the above concerns, with the help  
of majority women in the caucus and certainly  
the approval of the MWPC Steering Commit-  
tee will help promote these basic necessi-  
ties. Further, it will gain greater support  
from their minority sisters who remain cool  
toward MWPC activities and all other current  
women's movements.  

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that a Task Force  
be established for all of the minority cul-  
tures, chaired by the minority women's work-  
shop discussion leader, to begin attacking  
the problems identified by the panel of  
minority women.  

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the ten individ-  
uals who signed up for the minority task  
force be the official base for developing  
sensitivity in MWPC toward:  

1) more visibility on panels, conferences,  
etc. throughout Twin Cities, suburbs and  
state;  

2) more reflection of minority women in  
MWPC literature (except for the YWCA, which  
always seems to picture faces of white women);  

3) development of skills bank of minority  
women;  

4) consciousness-raising efforts directed  
toward dispelling myths and prejudices held  
by both majority and minority women; and  

5) alleviating the threat minority males  
feel toward the women's movement as they are  
just beginning to fill new economic  
positions, but still encouraging minority  
women to develop and pursue individual  
creativity.  

Chisholm which passed the new—now-vetoed—  
federal minimum wage bill.  

5) “we black women must get serious. A  
recent nationally held Black Women's Caucus  
charged $50 for registration"" and there were:  
complaints. And, frequently we criticize  
the women's liberation movement for high  

registration fees.""  

6) ""non-participation. We must take  
offices. We must decide that the goals of  
the women's movement are our goals. We  
better get in there and work for ourselves  
and our sisters.""  

7) “we see white women as members of  
white society. The role of white women  
has been defined in a racist society. Some  
fear white women will take the place of  
white men. This is based on a media stereo-  
type. Rather, the women's movement wants  
the elimination of the oppression. We can-  
not attack one prejudice while ignoring  
others. I have found that the women oppos-  
ing school busing also oppose change in  
women's roles.  

""The first wave of the women's liberation  
movement was the battle for the abolition  
of slavery. It could never have been won  
without the coalition of the women's move-  
ment with the anti-slavery movement. When  
the right to vote came with the 15th amend-  
ment, black women were left out in the cold  
with white women.""  

8) ""the personal. There is no indictment  
of black women/white males while condemning  
black males/white females. White sexual  
partners are acceptable for black females,  
but not for black males. Power doesn't come  
from your extemporaneous relationships with  
black women or with white women. There is  
a new role for black women in both the civil  
rights movement and the women's liberation  
movement and that is to build bridges, links  
in the HUMAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT.”  

Ms. Colom concluded her speech with a poem  
from Toni Cade's ""The Black Woman, An Antho-  
logy,"" which ended, ""'White womanhood is two  
enslaved; the difference is degree.'""

(A TRULY ORGANIC ACCUMULATION)  
by Monica Manning  

A naked woman laying on her side showing large curvy hips, long legs split from not touching and a sphere in her crotch caught my eye. The sphere held  

New York City and the woman had a smile on her lovely face. A sense of admiration swelled within me as I continued to stare at the drawing performed with red ink and black felt tip pen. Ah, the walls of women's rooms never cease to amaze me. I spotted this particular drawing at the Black Forest Inn along with memorable verse such as,  
'Fuck Indians  
that's what whites  
have done  
to Indians for a long time  
sisters unite  
brothers let's fuck  
what about the  
Wounded Knee Indians?'  
Flash, flash - the awareness of words on bathroom walls.  

I remember a time I was placated upon the toilet in that place. The walls were sterile white with fresh paint. I  

was not only constipated, but mortified in my search for something to read because there was nothing. As I reached for the T.P. I noticed a scrawl. My mortification turned to gratification as I read 'what happened to all my  

reading material?' That satiated me like a good grunt... bringing to mind another public bathroom.  

In July of 1973 on a hopping Friday evening I wandered into the Dibbo Hotel on Main Street in Hudson, Wisconsin to hear a friend play music. Time was about 7:30 p.m. as I entered the can to make my bladder gladder. The walls were barren so I made my way to  

the bar. There was a smoky aura out there but I stayed true and listened to the music. Round about closing time (1:00 a.m.) I ventured back into the head finding the walls plastered with jabberwocky. Since I was hassled by the local police to get my rear in gear I didn't have time to read it all so I took note of the biggest boldest writing which was glaring on the door leading out. DEAD NIGGERS SUCK. Such was the consciousness of the Dibbo. My friend got sick on the way home.  

Seems to me that women's poddies have been the place to let it all hang out. Brenners Pub is a good example.  

'Lesbians! women unite, Gay  

is good.  

Love is what you feel not who  
The hanging it out leads to the getting it out in terms of thoughtful retorts like 'I don't know about the rest of you chicks but I really groove on my husband! (That's so incredible Fuck forever!) (Yeah I think he's pretty good too)' or 'Why do all these good gay women write on anonymous bathroom walls? I wish I could meet you all / Lesbian love is beautiful... if it's so beautiful then why is it on a wall?)  

I wonder if Venus kept herself above arousal or did she merely rain her assessments downward as a lady cleaning a toilet may lift her eyes to the mixture of madness gushing forth a streamlined flush of mastered manure mixing feces with faces.  

Once when I was sipping hot cider in the Riverside Cafe the natural urge got to me so I strolled through the kitchen to a communal toilet. The surrounding walls were confining but not the writing. 'Rejoice Sisters  

God is a beautiful  

black lesbian'  

retort and he's dead!'  

I checked out the same walls today and found a new retort. 'It's true It's true but she's been beat up by a cop and strapped down in a mental hospital, and put down, put down by vicious, whiter, classier straighter females (sisters?). What to say but overloading. shit make big pile. Don't settle for Granny Goose while Old Dutch is around.  

On and on and on roll the graffiti. Spaced womb make for babe's cry (mynese proverb). If Dulcinea wasn't a man's dream would she be? Womenstration is coming! Ah, the orgasms abounding from women's writings in women's spaces are fetching.

GoldFlower,2,10,February 1974,8,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No10_page008.txt,"THE HOUSE OF ELIMA

BY MARY ELLEN SHAW

HE SAYS: There haven't been any women of  
real genius.

SHE SAYS: You never see the mountain rising  
up behind your back.

""Elima"" is a new magazine of poetry, jour-  
nals and reviews edited by Annie Gottlieb.  
An elima, she explains, is a house in a  
pygmy tribe set aside for the young girl/  
woman just unfolding into maturity. All of  
the women in the village, old and young,  
join together to sing and celebrate; the old-  
er women teaching lessons of an adult life.  
""Day after day, night after night, the elima  
house resounds with the throaty contralto of  
the older women and the high, piping voices  
of the youngest. It is a time of gladness  
and happiness, not for the women alone but  
for the whole people.""

In “Elima,"" the same singing, the same  
unfolding takes place. The women writers  
speak from different backgrounds and decades:

. practiced poets of vision and sparse words;  
young poets raising up words like torches;  
women exploring the fragments of their  
childhoods and collisions with society.  
“Elima"" incorporates journals, letters,  
poems and sympathetic quotes from estab-  
lished (male) literature. The magazine em-  
phasizes communicating what the experience  
of women has been, experimenting and prob-  
ing new ways of writing, and the process of  
fully-sexed, adult and potent.

In future issues, I would like to see some  
variety in format. The typesetting is  
blocked and unvaried, not inviting immediate  
or easy access. Another thing to look for-  
ward to is the tightening up of style. Work  
which is a beginning and exploration is nec-  
essary, but can't be kept up forever. If it  
were, it might put the magazine in that un-  
comfortable position so familiar to women's  
work, i.e., as an auxiliary and interesting  
sideline, but nothing to be taken seriously.  
There is a danger, on one hand, in bending  
too far to outside pressure, thus losing vi-  
tality and originality. But there is a  
greater danger, on the other hand, in not being  
as tough and demanding toward each other  
as the world will be.

There is an earthiness about much of the  
work, a focus, contact with the landscape on  
intimate, if sometimes brutal, terms. Tex-  
tures, plant life, paints, pots, glass, me-  
tal, body, animal. A child in Mexico with  
ulcerated eyes. The reality of bare walls  
in a New York prison cell, and the real wo-  

men who talked and fought and loved and  
lived there.

The journal fragments are personal and un-  
selfconscious. Each of them transfers a per-  
sonality, a person; someone known from years  
of late night word-fests; or that familiar  
voice in every woman's mind which tallies  
lists of betrayals and confusion. There is  

a concern with girlhood, of recreating the  

past to see what was forced, wheedled and  
conned; what was wasted and thrown away;  
what might have been possible.

Each poet gives us a handful of her voice.  
Styles and concerns vary, and there is a de-  
liberate range of deftness and facility.

Juli Loesch is flamboyant, outre, right-on  
and gentle:

Opened by a mailed fist  

on the carapace  
Opened by a  
tender craziness  
We open and open  

Roa Lynn has a terse, finely-sharpened  
bitterness, and she, too, is gentle:

So over the years  

The whole female world fragilely falls  

Into two groups, those that have, and  
those that haven't  

Got the courage to pierce their ears; a  
little American girl  

From Pittsburgh unexpectedly thrust her  
freckled cheek forward.

April Murphy speaks body-talk and cele-  
brates the rarely spoken-of phenomenon of  
active female sexuality:

lithe animal of my center, playful as an  

otter with her inside-out body.

Carol Muske speaks with a bony vividness.  
She uses images in a private, almost mythic  
vision:

My body moves bladelike through mirrors  

My head turns, a spool winding down  

To the last great ring of bone at the  

throat.

In this dark season  

I have grown a rough coat for winter  
Feel my hand budding with hardware  
My sweet smile  

Moving quiet through stone  

Like a new species.

There is a review of ""Women and Madness.""  
Marge Piercy is the reviewer; she is urgent  
and a bit frightening: what is being built/  
born/explored has to be done for survival.  
""Women can't yet believe we can be enhanced  
and protected by the achievements of any  
other women."" ""Women must feed one another  
emotionally, sexually, and intellectually,  
must support one another if the loser's  
cycle is to be broken.

I'm not sure absolute retreat and exile  
are necessary, but there is surely a need  
for a time of withdrawal and renewal. The  
house of elima is a good place to start;  
trading stories and songs, sharing harsh  
lessons if necessary, learning the duties  
and joyous freedom of maturity. A sounding  
out, a stretching, a testing begins here, as  
well as a ripening sense of community.

Before the door opens, the house of elima  
will rock and rock with laughter and song -  
and loud anger. And when the door does  
open, we will emerge in strength with full  
hands."
GoldFlower,2,10,February 1974,9,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No10_page009.txt,"Sally Hughes Makes Student  
Government ‘Women’s Work’

I've grown accustomed to positing all my  
hopes for female equality and a humane soc-  
iety in terms of a very distant future.  
Indeed, I've grown rather sour on occasion  
when I concede that only the dust of my sis-  
ters and I will witness a feminist/human  
millennium.

But in the midst of my latest pessimism, I  
met Sally Hughes, who is a living measure of  
the progress women have made in the past 10  
years.

She is a freshman at Metropolitan Commun-  
ity College, its first female Student Senate  
President and a leader of a late-February  
student protest against poor facilities and  
an unresponsive administration.

Breach of the Peace

In that protest, Sally was arrested for  
""breach of the peace"" and ""placing injurious  
materials in the streets.""

My interest was piqued at the outset—un-  
accustomed as I am to newspaper photos of  
young women being hauled off by police as  
leaders of protests. And upon reading the  
""Minneapolis Tribune's"" account of the dem-  
onstration, so much remained unsaid that I  
phoned Sally for an interview.

She readily agreed and a day later I  
arrived at Metropolitan's Memorial Hall,  
a building whose WPA drabness has been only  
slightly relieved by neo-psychedelic wall  
colors.

I presented myself at the basement-level  
Student Senate office, expecting to find one  
or two students at their leisure. But I  
walked into a working organization's office.

Seven or eight men and women were gathered  
around a desk and I caught conversational  
tailings: ""...I told him we'd completed  
that ..."" ""I've set up a meeting with them  
on Monday..."" ""The parking lot's been  
taken care of....""

In another corner of the room two young  
women removed scarves and gloves and attend-  
ed to an infant.

I realized I had encountered people ser-  
iously involved in their work and, conscious  
of my interruption, asked for Sally Hughes.

""She's right there..."" indicating the wo-  
man holding the baby.

She gave the child to her sister and led  
me to the quietest corner of the office.

Sally is tall and sturdily slender, her  
long, ash-brown hair hangs straight. She  
speaks directly and naturally.

""There has been a real communication ga-  
p between the administration and students,""  
she said, explaining the basis of last  
month's protest.

To dramatize their plight, 30 to 40 stu-  
dents gathered in front of the college be-  
fore dawn on February 1.

Sally and the other demonstrators handed  
out informational leaflets and dragged sev-  
eral of the cafeteria's uncomfortable-look-  
ing table-stool units onto the walks to  
illustrate their claims of poor facilities.

Police arrived shortly after the demonstra-  
tion began. ""At first they were directing  
traffic out of the area,"" Sally explained.

“Swooped Up”

But when the tables and stools appeared, a  
struggle ensued.

""We had a lot more participation once  
the police came,"" Sally said. Evidently the  
police recognized her as a central figure  
in the demonstration.

""I heard them yell, 'Get her.' It was  
really strange the way they swooped me up.""

and Arrested

She was the only student arrested. She  
has retained an attorney to defend her and,  
at this writing, is scheduled to appear in  
court.

However, Sally said she understood that  
Metropolitan's president, Howard Bergstrom,  
would negotiate with the District Attorney  
to drop charges against her. Bergstrom will

state that the demonstration was a college
matter, not a civil issue.

Sally has been Student Senate president
since the resignation of former president,
Tim McHie.

She ran for the Senate presidency to bring
unity to the school and to get us better
facilities.""

She explained that Metropolitan has ""very
serious space problems."" (The school has
an enrollment of 2,600 students, about half
part-time. The college uses six buildings.
But one is the library and the other is
McPhail Center, which also rents space to
the University of Minnesota.)

Resignation and
Day-Care --Top Priorities

Sally showed me a list of student demands,
arranged according to priority.

The first was the resignation of Bergstrom
(He has resigned, effective July 1; he
said his timing was ""embarrassing"" but co-
incidental).

“We want a day-care center on campus,"" she
continued. Day-care is the students' second
priority concern, despite the media's fas-
cination with a request for an integrated
restroom in the commons area.

""The administration has been working on a
day-care center for three years,"" Sally

In response to the protesters' de-
mands, Bergstrom sent the State Board
(which governs Metropolitan) a
""strongly worded statement"" in support of
on-campus day-care.

The students also demanded that the
only parking lot run on a first-come-first-
served basis. Bergstrom had allowed about
one-third of the lot to be cordoned off
and reserved for faculty and staff but has
agreed to accommodate the students' request.

(Other than the very small school parking
lot, the only parking I noticed were metered
areas bordering Loring Park.)

Among the students' other demands were:

Partial tuition refunds. (At
present students get no refund
if they drop a course mid-
quarter or drop below a full
course load.)

""The only way we can get any
tuition refund is to withdraw
from school,"" Sally noted.

Student input into all major
college decisions.

More suitable tables in the
cafeteria and commons area.

Research into eligibility re-
quirements of the National
Junior College Athletic Assoc-
iation and an integrated lab-
oratory in the commons area.

The students also demanded
that charges against Sally be
dropped.

The fact that so many of the demands had
been met within 24 hours of the demonstra-
tion speaks well for the Senate's organiz-
ation and efficiency.

Woman-Power

Sally pointed out that this year all Sen-
ate officers, with one exception, are wo-
men. Indeed, the school as a whole appears
congenial to women.

The college newspaper, ""Metropolitan
Journal,"" has its first woman editor this
year, Sherry Strong.

""Metropolitan has the first women's stud-
ies program among the state's community col-
leges,"" Sally said.

The program has been operating for a year
under the tutelage of two female faculty
members and offers two courses a quarter:
“Women in the 70's“ and “Advanced Critical
Readings.""

Several of the women in the Senate off-
ice agreed that ""there are a lot of Metro-
politan women involved in outside women's
groups,"" although the college has not yet
started its own women's group.

As impressive as the heightened conscious-
ness of Metropolitan's women was the coop-
eration evident between men and women in
the Student Senate office. The women were
obviously very much in charge of themselves
and the men accorded them the easy respect
and camaraderie that flourishes between
equals.

least temporarily. Feeling positive, I

by Susan Cushman

When I was growing up my father had a ram-
rod policy about young women and travel. He
combined the interests of respectability and
safety in his edict that my sisters and I
could not travel alone or with female
friends because that was dangerous. We also
could not travel with male friends for fear
of losing our real or figurative virginity.
In short, trips were to be made with our
parents or not at all.

Many parents enforced similar stifling
rules which drastically curtailed our young
movements. Colleges and universities fol-
lowed the parental lead in establishing
hours for women while the men did as they
liked. “In the small midwestern town where
I was in undergraduate school, the dean of
women warned us many times about the ""tran-
sient perverts"" who unaccountably stalked
the cornfields. She advised us to have es-
corts after sundown, yet for four years I
took a nightly walk expressly for the soli-
tude, without encountering anything more
than an occasional overzealous dog.

It took a few months in a truly dangerous
city (St. Louis) for me to realize that
these authority figures had been right about
one thing - women are favorite targets of
most crimes. The question is what to do
about it. Each individual, it seems, must
find a comfortable balance between personal
safety and personal freedom. If the danger
is greater for a given group of people, the
freedom must apparently shrink to maintain
comparable survival odds.

A recently published book supports this
conclusion while at the same time offering
some useful suggestions for increasing fe-
male safety without seriously limiting li-
berty. ""Lady Beware"" by Peter Arnold (Dou-
bleday, 182 pages, $5.95) is written in a
somewhat annoying fashion, frequently speci-
fying times when a woman is alone as times
when ""your man"" is away. Nevertheless, the
book is valuable because it explicitly des-
cribes crimes against women and possible
preventative measures.

Some of these measures, such as installing
effective locks, can be taken infrequently
and require just one burst of determination
and concern. Others necessitate a change in
daily habits. Arnold presents everyday ways
of carrying a purse so as to discourage
purse snatchers, leaving an apartment so as
to discourage burglars, and walking so as to
discourage prospective muggers or rapists.

Perhaps the most helpful advice comes from
convicted men who describe their selective
attitudes when choosing victims. In many
cases the enticing combination is solitude
and preoccupation - a woman alone who does
not appear to be paying attention to her
surroundings. By making herself an easy
mark, a woman seemingly invites the most
simplistic and even half-hearted crimes.

The solution, of course, is not to cower
indoors with a cadre of male protectors.
Rather, each woman should analyze the way
she lives and then make that particular way
as safe as possible. If you frequently walk
at night, you'll be safer if you carry a po-
lice whistle. If you get around mostly by
car, it's a good idea to check the back seat
floor before you get in and to keep your
doors locked while driving to protect your-
self from unwanted passengers. Habits like
these improve your safety without interfer-
ing with your movements or compromising your
independence.

If you do suspect that someone is sizing
you up in an unfriendly manner, don't be re-
luctant to do something about it before you
are proved right. Policewomen who were
interviewed in ""Lady Beware"" agree that most
women who are attacked have a premonition
of danger but don't do anything about it.
Alertness doesn't help if women don't act
decisively on their perceptions. Stepping
into a lighted store or out of an uncomfor-
tably intimate elevator won't implicate a
possibly innocent person and can perhaps
save you a bad experience."
GoldFlower,2,10,February 1974,12,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No10_page012.txt,"Chances

Another point that policewomen make is  
that forethought is in itself a safety  
measure. ""A woman who never thought about  
being mugged or raped would be in great  
trouble if it happened. If a woman just one  
time thinks, ""What if a man attacked me?”  
she'd be much safer. Just so she has some-  
thing to fall back on.

""If you've thought about it before, your  
thought will flash into your mind. If you  
haven't thought about it before, nothing  
will come to mind and you'll do nothing or  
you'll panic.""

Once a woman is unavoidably in a danger-  
ous situation, she can often escape if she  
stays calm. Attackers usually have the  
edge because they take their victims by  
surprise. But many criminals underestimate  
female resources and can be surprised in  
turn quite easily.

With an unarmed attacker, the best method  
is probably to fight back immediately, mak-  
ing as much noise as possible. Since most  
men don't expect women to struggle seriously  
and women in danger are usually quite  
strong, the chances of escaping are reason-  
ably good.

A woman confronted by an armed assailant is  
better off pretending to comply with him un-  
til a chance for escape opens up. The im-  
portant thing is to remain calm enough to  
seize whatever opportunities are offered.

""Lady Beware"" describes these situations  
and many others, following the ""what if"" for-  
mat suggested by one victim.

Handbooks can be distasteful, because they can make it seem  
as if genuine safety is only for fanatics  
who are willing to devote their lives to it.  
""Lady Beware"" recognizes that safety is a  
desirable condition of life, but not the  
whole point of it. Arnold presents a range  
of preventative measures so that a reader  
can choose the ones that suit her. For  
instance, he starts out a chapter on hitch-  
hiking by saying women should never do it,  
and then proceeds to discuss women thumbing  
it, on the assumption that many nevertheless  
will. This kind of realism makes the book  
palatable.

We can't avoid taking chances in our daily  
lives and probably don't want to. But we  
should have a pretty fair idea of what  
chances we do take and how to handle the  
consequences. A book like ""Lady Beware""  
can help.

Battles Won

“I met but few of the stars while I was in  
Hollywood. In New York I had met Mr. Charles  
Chaplin and Miss Greta Garbo, the latter a  
being who is, physically, of the lily tribe,  
but with a human heart and mind.

But I did meet Miss Marilyn Monroe.

In private life she was not in the least  
what her calumniators would have wished her  
to be. She was very quiet, had great natur-  
al dignity (I cannot imagine anyone who  
knew her trying to take a liberty with her),  
and was extremely intelligent. She was also  
exceedingly sensitive.

What will-power she must have needed in or-  
der to remain the human being she was, after  
the cruelty with which, in the past, she was  
treated! That is over now, and she is ac-  
cepted as the fine artist that she was. But  
that cruelty was completely odious. It  
arose partly, I think, from the envy of peo-  
ple who are devoid of beauty, and partly  
from the heartless stupidity of those who  
have never known a great and terrifying pov-  
erty. There are people, also, who cannot  
believe that beauty and gaiety are a part of  
goodness...

Immediately on my arrival in Hollywood, a  
certain American magazine with a huge cir-  
culation asked me to write for them...But  
still more important to them was that Miss  

since it was obvious that we were born to  
hate each other, would do so at first sight,  
and that our subsequent insults to each  
other would cause a commotion when reported.  
They never made a greater mistake.

That afternoon she wore a green dress and,  
with her yellow hair, looked like a daffo-  
dil. We talked mainly, as far as I remem-  
ber, about Rudolph Steiner, whose works she  
had just been reading...

In repose her face was at moments strange-  
ly, prophetically tragic, like the face of  
a beautiful ghost - a little spring-ghost,  
an innocent fertility-daemon, the vegetation  
spirit that was Ophelia.”

PSYCHOLOGY and WOMEN

AT MARSHALL 'U' HIGH SCHOOL

Dr. Lois Erickson at the
University of Minnesota has
developed a curriculum to pro
mote psychological maturity
in women using a developmental
framework derived from the
theories of Jane Loevinger
and Lawrence Kohlberg.

Loevinger's theory postulates
that an individual's ego develops
from a young child's differentiation
between self and non-self
through various stages of emotional
and social development to a possible
""integrated"" stage in which complexity
of thought, perception of choices,
respect for others' autonomy, and a
valuing of justice are predominate.
Kohlberg's position is that moral
development progresses along stages
of growth which increasingly integrate
the concept of justice—from a
""what's in it for me"" instrumental
hedonism orientation toward a possible
stage of moral decision-making based
on principles of universal justice.
Thus, they both see human growth as
progressing along stages—which direc-
tion can provide a goal for education.

This goal, movement along the
developmental stages of growth has
become the major objective in Erickson's
curriculum for women.

Extensive research indicates that
American men are more likely to reach
higher stages of development than
American women. Most women remain
on stage 3, social conforming orientation,
while about four times as many men
move ahead toward the more complex
modes of thought. Of importance, it has
been found that no difference in moral
maturity exists between the sexes until
adolescence, at which time girls plateau
in psychological growth while boys
continue the movement toward higher
stages.

Dr. Erickson said several studies
demonstrate that girls ""sell out"" their
competency motivation sometime in high
school and get anchored in a lifestyle
that reinforces the middle stages of
growth, the social compromising stage.
The theories acknowledge this inconsistency
will lead to an erosion of women's maturity,
and the research bears this out.

""We've talked about it so long, now we
must do something about it!"" is Erickson's
position.

The curriculum model developed by
Erickson used a ""Learning Psychology
by doing psychology"" format first set
forth by John Dewey. Field interviewing
of girls and women across the life span
provided a means of viewing the process
of female development through different
ages, stages, and tasks. In the seminar
sessions the high school women reflected
about and integrated their interview data
and also focused on current articles on
the women's movement and related literary
works. A continuous thru-way focus was
maintained between the interview experiences,
the works of literature, and the examination
of ""the self."" Multiple assessments were
run on the class and on the Loevinger
measures of ego maturity and on the Kohlberg
measure of moral maturity.

This curriculum is the first in a series
of classes being developed to examine
sex roles and personal growth. A two-person
relationship class and a parenting class
(both with males) are now being piloted
and researched.

GoldFlower,2,10,February 1974,15,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No10_page015.txt,"""Talk of American Spacewomen

Makes Me Sick”

Well, what do you know?

The National Aeronautics and  
Space Administration (NASA)  
recently announced that women  
appear no less able than men,  
physiologically, to withstand  
the rigors of space flight.

This remarkable fact was an-  
nounced following five weeks  
of testing eight Air Force  
nurses at NASA's Ames Re-  
search Center.

According to an account from  
the “Los Angeles Times,” NASA  
spokesmen stressed that these  
results ""should not be taken  
as a back door commitment to  
put women into orbit, however.""

No, the facts were just spun  
around cathode ray tubes and  
the story broadcast over ra-  
dio and television and clack-  
ed over wire service tele-  
types. You see, these tests de-  
termining the fitness of women  
as astronauts have already  
been run—14 years ago.

Thirteen women, several with  
more credentials than John  
Glenn and Scott Carpenter,  
were tested and found to be  
superior candidates for the  
astronaut program. Twelve  
more were slated for testing.  
But all have turned to other  
jobs after waiting for the  
space program to make use of  
their training, talents, and  
energies.

This latest ""women are mak-  
ing progress"" smoke screen  
was beautiful. The lovely  
Air Force cuties lined up to  
be panned by the television  
cameras—slowly. Yep, they  
were treated just like the  
guys and even did without sex  
during the five-week testing.  
And they all were single.

Interestingly, the publicity  
came after a well-done cover  
article on the first women  
astronaut candidates publish-  
ed in ""MS"" magazine last  
September. It was even more  
interesting that no one men-  
tioned the original women  
astronaut candidates in the  
latest coverage of women's  
progress.

By Heidi Reidel!

But women's news is seldom  
covered in detail by mass  
media, so what is well done  
is worth repeating.

Joan McCullough wrote of  
""The 13 who were left behind""  
in September's ""MS,"" recount-  
ing the testing of women be-  
gun in 1959.

We all know about one small  
step for man and recognize  
the names, John Glenn, Neil  
Armstrong, Scott Carpenter.  
But what about Jerrie Cobb?

In 1959 Cobb had logged  
10,000 hours in the air,  
more than any other candidate  
being tested at that time. Cobb  
was the woman whose test re-  
sults would determine wheth-  
er other women would be test-  
ed. Her test results were  
exceptional and twelve other  
women were tested—

They, too, were found to be  
exceptionally qualified can-  
didates. In some ways, they  
were superior to men, accord-  
ing to McCullough's article;  
they weighed less on the av-  
erage, a potential saving of  
$1,000 a pound for cargo and  
human weight, for they also  
consumed less food and oxygen  
and could use a smaller cap-  
sule. They were more radi-  
ation-resistant, less prone  
to heart attack, and more dur-  
able in the event of heat,  
pain, noise, and loneliness.

Despite the flying color  
test results, NASA abruptly  
halted testing in July of  
1971, after 13 of the slated  
25 had been tested.

NASA had given no warning,  
no explanation, and no comment.

The women took the matter up  
with a specially convened  
Congressional subcommittee.  
The hearing lasted two days,  
with one NASA spokesman say-  
ing, ""Talk of American space-  
women makes me sick to my  
stomach,"" and others insisting  
the program would be impeded  
if they were forced to in-  
clude women.

And John Glenn, for whom  
qualification regulations had  
been waived, said magnanimous-  
ly, ""If we found women who  
could prove that they had  
more capabilities than the  
men, we'd welcome them aboard  
with open arms.""

Once again women had to be  
more equal to be equal and the  
subcommittee admonished the  
""good ladies"" to be patient.

Fourteen years have stretched  
on. Hans Mark, presently  
directing NASA's Ames Research  
Center, says, ""So far we see  
no reason to believe there  
are any inherent problems to  
women flying in space."" It is  
a little hard to swallow. And  
the American taxpayer should  
find that kind of repetitive  
song and dance intolerable as  
well.

These recently tested Air  
Force nurse volunteers are be-  
ing used to set medical stan-  
dards for women who may be  
included on American Space  
shuttles in the 1980s.

NASA administrator, Chuck  
Berry, told a recent space  
medicine conference, ""For a  
long-duration flight such as  
to Mars, the crews would be  
confined inside their space-  
craft for nearly a year.  
With so much time on their  
hands, they'd react like oth-  
er normal human beings; they  
would want sexual diversion.  
It is therefore unrealistic  
to plan future flights with-  
out coming to grips with the  
problem of women. Naturally,  
the women would be fully-op-  
erational crew members...not  
only there for sex.""

Gotcha, Mr. Berry. Over and out."

activities both in and out of  
Buffalo. If you can prepare  
a short tape on your activi-

send us information about  
your activities as a group-

lesbianism in minn. 4 blinded justice

june 1973 vol. 2 no. 3"
GoldFlower,2,3,june 1973,2,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No3_page002.txt,"Malvina Reynolds is a songwriter with an  
active conscience and a perpetual overabun-  
dance of material. ""I have to fight off sub-  
jects,"" she says. ""People are always sug-  
gesting them to me. ‘Have you written any-  
thing about the Aswan Dam?' It bugs me;  
they don't know anything about songwriting.""  

When I met Malvina at the Walker Art Cen-  
ter last month, she had just given in to the  
urge to write about Watergate. Having re-  
sisted the issue for months because ""you  
can't satirize the satire,"" she had suddenly  
been taken by the phrase, “meet me at the  
Watergate."" Soon she was singing the new  
song over the telephone to Walter Cronkite,  
and a few days later, appeared with it on  
the CBS Evening News.  

As with the Watergate song, ""Songwriting  
happens when it happens."" Most often, she  
is struck by something she sees or hears and  
the song forms on the spot.  

""I can't write sitting down quietly in a  
room. Usually I'm moving, riding in a car  
or on a bus.""  

The 72-year-old resident of Berkeley,  
California, spends most of her time song-  
writing and performing. She has been at it  
for 30 years, after discovering that her doc-  
torate in literature was helpful when solving  
crossword puzzles, but not when looking for  
jobs.  

""I never could get a job teaching. Nobody  
told me why, but I have my own ideas on the  
matter.""  

Malvina's songwriting began when she ""fell  
in with people like Pete Seeger, Earl Robin-  
son, and Woody Guthrie who were interested in  
our folk heritage.""  

""They brought in powerful music, understa-  
ted musically and lyrically. I got a guitar,  
learned a few chords and that's all I know  
now.""  

At first Malvina's work was performed by  
others - Seeger, Judy Collins, Joan Baez,  
Harry Belafonte - which accounts for our  
close familiarity with her songs but not her  
name.  

She comments, ""Other singers kept doing my  
popular songs over and over. I had other  
good songs no one knew about. So I decided  
to do it myself.  

""I am not a great singer by any means. But  
nobody minds. If I had a better voice, I  
would have gone in a different direction,  
not as good a direction. I would have shown  
off my voice.""  

Malvina Reynolds Sings  
for People who Agree  

An Interview  

By Susan  
Cushman  

Instead, Malvina has become an irresistible  
social and political critic whose beliefs are  
so tunefully presented that one can't help  
but hum along.  

Malvina frequently denies that her own  
songs are folk songs, because one person  
can't write an instant tradition. Rather,  
she says she writes what sounds like folk  
songs.  

Folk songs have a durability which sur-  
vives countless renditions, and perhaps Mal-  
vina's songs sound folkish because you never  
really get tired of them. Before I attended  
her concert at the Walker, I was sure that  
my capacity for “Little Boxes"" had been fil-  
led years ago. But Malvina knew better than  
I what effect the well-known words and tune  
could have on an audience.  

The fun is in the knowing  

The song was flawlessly funny, mostly be-  
cause of the exact fit between the knowing  
delivery and the equally knowing reception.  
Most of us had grown up with this song,  
singing it at our concerts, around our camp-  
fires, in our avant-garde church services,  
and unanimously confirming its complaint.  

As Malvina sang it, I realized that was one  
agreement we never quite outgrew; ten years  
later and we still didn't like those houses,  
much less, their way of life:  

Little boxes on the hillside,  

Little boxes made of ticky-tacky,  
Little boxes on the hillside,  

Little boxes all the same;  

There's a green one and a pink one  

And a blue one and a yellow one  

And they're all made out of ticky-tacky  
And they all look just the same.  

Speaking before the concert, Malvina men-  
tioned that a breakfast cereal manufacturer  
had once approached her requesting permission  
to use ""Little Boxes"" in a commercial. She  
refused.  

Most of Malvina's work has a laugh in it  
which surfaces in more or less painful ways.  
She comments that her songs are ""largely  
satire. Something can't be funny unless it  
has bite in it that hurts, that matters.”  

One of my favorites is ""We Hate To See  
Them Go,"" a wry tune describing a dream  
about sending ""the gentlemen of distinction  
in the Army.""

First of Two Parts

Ten per cent of Minnesota
women belong to one of the
most unprotected minorities
in the state. Ten per cent
is the amount of Minnesota
women who are lesbians, esti-
mates Karen Browne, founder
of the Lesbian Resource Cen-
ter, 710 W. 22nd St., Minnea-
polis.

Lesbians are doubly defined
as ""second-class citizens"" by
society because they are wom-
en and because they prefer
members of their own sex.

Historically, lesbians have
been condemned by law in ev-
ery state. Descriptions of
homosexuality as ""lewd and
lascivious behavior"" and “a
crime against nature"" are
used by several states in
their statutes. If female,
as well as male, homosexuals
aren't specified by some
states' laws, it has been be-
cause females were considered
less important socially.

In Minnesota, terms against
homosexuality aren't quite so
harsh but the lack of civil
rights for gays is the same.

Legislature Says ‘No’

In May, in the final
squeeze of the state's leg-
islative session, a confer-
ence committee from both
houses rejected a provision
to the Human Rights Act pro-
hibiting discrimination in
employment to homosexuals.

The gay provision, which
was introduced by Sen. Nick
Coleman, had passed earlier
in the Senate. Coleman's
original proposal, which
passed in the Senate's Sub-
Committee on Judicial Admin-
istration in mid-April and
the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee a few weeks later also
protected gays in housing.

The gay provision itself
was an amendment to a broader
bill drafted by Sam Richard-
son, State Commissioner of
Human Rights.

Richardson's original draft
did finally pass through the
conference committee. It
prohibits discrimination in
the areas of housing, employ-
ment, education and public
services because of marital
status, physical or mental
disability, or status as a
welfare recipient.

No other state has passed
civil rights legislation for
gays. However, in New York
City an executive order was
issued forbidding discrimina-
tion against gays in govern-
ment employment. An Ann Ar-
bor, Michigan executive order

expanded the prohibition to
private employers.

In the Minnesota House,
gays have suffered defeat
this session in another piece
of legislation. The ""Sodomy
Bill"" would have legalized
homosexuality among consent-
ing adults. But Steve
Endean, lobbyist for the
Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union (MCLU) believes that
the defeat is just temporary
and that the bill will be
brought up again when the
legislature re-convenes next
January.

If the ""Sodomy Bill"" ever
becomes law, Minnesota will
join only seven other states
which have similar legisla-
tion.

Illinois pioneered legisla-
tive acceptance of homosexua-
lity between consenting
adults in 1961. Connecticut,
Colorado, Delaware, Ohio and
Hawaii all approved similar
legislation within the last
one and one-half years.

In Florida and Washington
D.C. restrictive laws simi-
lar to the present Minnesota
law were thrown out by the
courts as unconstitutional.

Mike Weatherbee, co-ordina-
tor of MCLU and Browne
acknowledge the importance of
the Human Rights Amendment as
a legal precedent.

The only national basis for
civil rights now is the 14th
Amendment to the US Constitu-
tion which prevents the gov-
ernment from discriminating

unless there's a rational rea-

son. ""Housing isn't a case
here, though, because most of
it is privately owned. And
the amendment doesn't protect
against private employers,
either,"" Weatherbee pointed
out.

Because of the lack of
jurisdiction, no cases have
ever been brought against a
private employer or landlord
in Minnesota. ""We (the MCLU)
frequently have to turn down
cases because there is no
law,"" said Weatherbee.

Landlords Discriminate

There are many cases in
Minneapolis where landlords
and employers have discrimin-
ated against lesbians, how-
ever.

Browne and her roommate,
Cindy Hanson, a former direc-
tor of Gay House and founder
of Gay Community Services
spent two months trying to
find an apartment. But after
each landlord asked where the
women worked, Browne and Han-
son were always turned down.

“Finally, we just told a
landlord that we worked in a
‘straight’ place and we got

an apartment,"" said Browne.

For the professional woman,
a major problem is hiding the
fact that she is a lesbian.

Helen Livingston teaches
first grade in a Catholic
grade school. Because of the
small size of the faculty,
she finally felt that she
couldn't keep her lesbianism
a secret anymore.

The school didn't fire her
directly but ""ambiguously""
refused to renew her contract
for next year because of
“conflicting philosophies.""

""Professional women who
come into contact with people
more than factory workers are
more likely to get fired,""
said Livingston.

Organized religion, espec-
ially the Catholic Church,
remains one of the main ob-
stacles to lesbians. Tradi-
tionally, religion has con-
demned everything but pro-
creative sex. Anything else
was ""sinful"" and ""perverse.""

But some branches of Pro-
testantism are changing.
Browne notes that a few city
churches are helping to fund
the Lesbian Resource Center.
(Other funds come from priv-
ate foundations and personal
contributions.)

Religion and government are
the main institutions which
prolong basic societal beliefs
against homosexuality. Even
if a lesbian can overcome the
religious obstacle by removing
herself directly from the
church, there are always more
concrete and visible barriers
within the government.

Government Says ‘No’

According to a 1969 issue of
Humanist magazine, ""Federal
government serves to set the
tone and example of the syste-
matic exclusion of this sig-
nificantly large minority of
its citizens from full parti-
cipation in the society in
which they live, and their
systematic relegation to sec-
ond class citizens.""

The ""significantly large
minority"" of lesbians in the
country is about 10 million,
estimate Del Martin and Phyl-
lis Lyon, co-founders of the
national lesbian organization,
Daughters of Bilitis.

The federal government's
disapproval of lesbianism is
expressed mainly in the civil
service.

The government still treats
homosexuality as an emotional
disturbance and emphasizes
psychoanalysis as a ""cure.""

“Homosexuality has been de-
fined into a sickness or dis-
order through subjective, per-
sonal, social, moral, cultur-
al and religious value judge-

No One

ments...the ones who accuse
don't do adequate scientific
study to validate what they
say,"" states the Humanist
article.

However, the Kinsey report
on Sexual Behavior in the
Human Female documents studies
of both sexes substantiating
that homosexuality is not a
""sickness"" but a ""preference.""

The civil service prejudice
is stated in its list of gen-
eral qualifications. ""Persons
about whom there is evidence
that they have engaged in...
homosexual...acts, without
evidence of rehabilitation,
are not suitable for Federal
employment."" This rule is
without regard for the per-
son's individual qualifica-
tions for the job.

Stemming largely from the
McCarthy period of the 1950's,
the civil service's opinion
is that homosexuals will have
a ""disrupting effect upon the
morale and efficiency of any
organization."" Yet the rela-
tion between a worker's off-
the-job behavior and her on-
the-job efficiency is never
explained.

There is an obvious incon-
gruence in the government's
position. While civil service
is fearful of placing a homo-
sexual in an office of hetero-
sexuals, ""The government
wouldn't hesitate to put a
Negro in an office of racists
or a Jew in an office of anti-
Semites,"" concludes the Huma-
nist article.

Currently, the government
is able to fire workers
because in the government's
definition, homosexuality is
a ""rational basis"" for firing,
said Weatherbee.

Again, the professional

lesbians are the ones most
affected by this policy.
This includes teachers, women
in the medical profession and
any other profession licensed
by the state.

The Human Rights amendment
could locally challenge gov-
ernmental hiring practices.

Courts Say ‘Maybe’

Discrimination in housing
and employment are problems
faced by both lesbians and
male homosexuals. Yet, gay
women are faced with another
legal problem--of having to
prove that they are ""fit""
mothers.

Weatherbee said that there
have been several MCLU cases
where an ex-husband or rela-
tive has tried to get the
children taken away from
their lesbian mother.

Browne explained the only
""semi-victory"" in the nation

(continued on page 4)

people change, you told me
and it isn't right for us

to stay in each other's arms
there is more for each of us
somewhere else

we will be stronger apart

we will find new energies
and I say I understand

we have gone through our
changes

I hate that word

I let you pack

we laugh, we are happy

for what has passed between
us and we have shared love
and I say I understand

it is not good to be together
if we need someone else
someone new and different

yet that night I reach across the

emptiness searching for your
warmth and I am cold and
alone

I scream and no one hears me
those screams in the night
that no one ever hears

for a lesbian mother regard-
ing child custody.

Two Washington men chal-
lenged their ex-wives who
were living together with
both women's children. With
the aid of a woman lawyer and
favorable testimony by sever-
al social workers, the women
retained custody of their
children.

But the women were ordered
by the court to no longer
live together nor even see
each other in the presence of
their children.

The MCLU has never had a
call concerning attempts by
the Welfare Department to
gain custody of children just
because their mother is a
lesbian.

Welfare tries to gain cust-
ody only if there is also a
reason to believe that the
mother isn't caring for her
children properly.

If a mother has to go to
court to retain custody of
her children, ""most attorneys
will tell her to hush up her
lesbianism,"" said Browne.

Discrimination of lesbians
appears in written and un-
written forms.

Browne had much difficulty
in trying to find a landlord
that would rent to a ""Lesbian
Resource Center."" And once a
location for the center was
found, the telephone and pub-
lic utilities companies were
reluctant to connect their
services.

Browne, who is one of the
three women at the Lesbian
Resource Center who split a
$500 a month salary, predicts
difficulties the center might
have when it applies to the
state for incorporation.
""It's just hard for any gay
group to get a tax-exempt
status,"" she said.

The Lesbian Resource Center
as a whole has no definite
political philosophy so that
“all sorts of people feel
comfortable here,"" said
Browne.

""Yet, most lesbians are
obviously feminists,"" con-
cluded Livingston.

Few Alternatives

Before the Lesbian Resource
Center opened in mid-January,
Twin City lesbians had only
two places where they could
socialize as lesbians, Gay
House and ""the bar.""

But Gay House is male dom-
inated and never really at-
tracted that many women, said
Hanson.

Livingston continued,
""There was a lot of solidari-
ty at first but things kind
of died out. More women come
to the center than ever would
have come to Gay House.""

In Minnesota there aren't
any laws, such as those in
California, which prohibit
kissing and handholding by
members of the same sex in a
bar. ""Or if there are, no
one ever enforces them,""
Browne said.

Gay bars in the Twin Cities
are managed by ""straights""
who can take advantage of the
fact that homosexuals have al-
most no place else to go to-
gether.

Hanson implied that the gay
bars are Chicago-syndicate
controlled and can afford to
""pay off"" police so that the
bar's clientele won't be has-
sled.

If this is true or not,
Browne said that ""the police
haven't given us any trouble
at the bars or the center.""

Hanson thinks that a
""straight"" syndicate can mo-
nopolize gay bars because the
high price of a liquor
license makes it impossible
for most gays to buy their
own bar.

Policeman Causes Trouble

Besides, owning a gay bar
can be a risky business.

A couple of years ago a
lesbian woman owned a gay bar
in a St. Paul suburb. One
night an off-duty policeman
came into the bar, allegedly
caused some confusion, then
called into his station with
false reports about what the
women were doing in the bar.

Upon closer examination of
the incident by a senior of-
ficer it was determined that
the policeman was at fault
for the disturbance and he
was subsequently discharged
from the force.

But the fear of being
exposed through publicity of
the event made most of the
lesbian patrons stay away
from the bar after that. The
bar soon closed.

Twin City lesbians' rela-
tive freedom from problems
with the police is a contrast
to Martin and Lyon's reports
in Lesbian/Woman of the con-
stant harassment of Califor-
nia police towards lesbians.

For women who don't care to
go to the bars, the Lesbian
Resource Center offers a
variety of activities. Dis-
cussion groups, theater,
films, dances, a coffeehouse
and softball team give les-
bians a chance to be in con-
tact with other lesbians.

Radicalesbians

The level of organized po-
litical activity varies among
lesbians of the Twin Cities
as it does among lesbians of
the country.

""Radicalesbians"" are usual-
ly younger women who identify
politically and socially with
their minority. At the other
end of the spectrum are wom-
en, usually older, who are
so well established in their
communities and jobs that
they feel they stand to lose
too much personally if they
become politically active.
But all lesbians agree that
their rights are essential.
As Martin and Lyons state in
Lesbian/Woman, ""No longer is
toleration acceptable. The
lesbians, along with all op-
pressed people, want freedom
and we want it now!""

lation to gay activist, James

The bankers and the diplomats are going  
in the Army,  

It seemed too bad to keep them from the  
wars they love to plan,  

We're all of us contented that they'll  
fight a dandy war,  

They don't need propaganda, they know  
what they're fighting for.  

They'll march away with dignity and in  
the best of form,  

And we'll just keep the laddies here to  
keep the lassies warm.  

Malvina does not intend that her songs  
carry messages. ""I sing what people have  
formulated anyway. I address myself to  
those who agree with me or are in a fringe  
limbo.""  

Since many of her concerts are benefit  
performances for causes such as the women's  
and peace movements, the Ellsberg defense,  
and the American Indian Movement, her  
audience is naturally selected for her en-  
lightened and engaging point of view.  

Malvina's interest in women's issues is  
long-standing, as evidenced by her equivocal  
""We Don't Need the Men"" written in 1958.  
The chorus chortles:  

We don't need the men, We don't need the  
men,  

We don't need to have them around, except  
for now and then.  

They can come to see us when we need to  
move the piano,  

Otherwise they can stay at home and read  
about the White Sox.  

Blind Justice  

Local Style  

(Cont’d)  

Fifteen years ago, Malvina considered this  
song a tongue-in-cheek exercise; the raucous  
enthusiasm it produced at her concert sug-  
gests that today the song carries more ser-  
ious implications.  

With a little less good humor, ""No Room""  
recognizes the rise of world hunger and over-  
population:  

No room! No room! No room!  

Holy is the fetus,  

But babies once born are simply human,  

And if they die in the streets of  
Calcutta  

No one will notice but their ma,  

And ain't that just like a woman.  

The wider the grin, it seems, the deeper  
the bite.  

I seldom meet people who are satisfied  
with their lives, and it surprised me to so  
easily recognize a contented person when I  
saw her. Malvina Reynolds truly likes her  
life, and with good reason. She lives by  
her talents and her convictions, supporting  
herself by doing what she likes best on her  
own terms.  

Malvina Reynolds works without an agent.

When I moved to Minneapolis last year I  
was surprised and gratified to see a public  
feminist display not far from my door. A  

larger than lifesize statue of a woman tak-  
ing notes prominently sat on the lawn of the  
Metropolitan School of Law a few blocks away  
from my apartment. ""What a way to advertise  
for female law students,"" I cheerfully  
thought to myself, and if the door of the  
building had been open, I would have gone in  
to compliment the school on its ingenuity  
and enlightened politics.  

That locked door saved us all some embar-  
rassment. Only days later, I read in the  
morning paper that the statue was a throw-  
back to the fairly recent days when the  
building had housed a school for medical  
secretaries. Since that educational enter-  
prise had failed, the same founder was now  

attempting to establish the law school. Once  
the building had been relabeled, the statue  
was naturally considered inappropriate.  
Sculptural alteration was scheduled and soon  
came in the form of a black painted blind-  
fold and a pair of ironwork scales. Presto,  
and we viewed that great feminine character  
Blind Justice. So what if she was hunched  
over a desk and who cared that the notebook  
was a misplaced prop? At least she couldn't  
be mistaken for a prototypical law student.  
The school never got off the ground, and  
a ""Space Available"" sign eventually appeared  
at the statue's base. The fate of the sta-  
tue has not been announced, but her proven  
versatility will no doubt guarantee her a  
long, if somewhat curious, life.

Alexandria hasn't been the  
same. After the class was  
over, they decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-raising group.

Trap Door and T.V.

One of the women is Wendy  
Wallace. On weekdays, she  
pulls open a trap door in a  
building downtown and descends to a shop called ""The  
Trap Door"" where she and her  
mother sell carved gourds,  
silver rings, wicker baskets,  
wooden boxes, and other gifts.

On weekends, Wendy enters  
another door, that of the  
KCMT-TV station in Alexandria,  
and does the weekend weather.

Wendy has a long history  
of television work. When she  
was 15, she read the weather  
on TV in Fargo. Later, she  
did Unguentine and All-State  
Insurance commercials in California.

Women’s Work

She met little resistance  
when she applied for the job  
at KCMT; the job had already  
been pegged as ""women's work""  
--the former weatherperson  
was a woman. Now, she says,  
if one of the talent is absent  
during the week, she substitutes in the weather slot,  
but never in any other. If  
the anchorman is gone, she  
will replace the weatherman,  
who replaces the sports announcer, who replaces the  
anchorman...

Unsatisfied with these conditions, she conceived a plan  
for another show, a show on  
women, and approached the  
station director with her  
idea. “I was shocked when he  
approved it,"" she said, and  
since February, Wendy has  
been hosting a 15-minute show  
called ""What's New with Women""  
on Sundays at 12:15 pm.  
She has reported on such topics as welfare, divorce, and  
abortion, and has interviewed  
Carol Jetland, of the Minnesota  
Education Association Committee on Women.

Last fall an adult education  
class on the women's movement  
brought local feminists together,  
and since then Wendy's radicalization seems  
to have been prophesied in  
the name she and her husband  
Patrick gave to their 19-month-old daughter, Erin  
Pendrick. ""Pendrick is a  
phonetic combination of our  
names...We took the 'end'  
from 'Wendy' and the 'Prick' from 'Patrick.'""

Viewers and Colleagues

Viewer response has been  
disappointing. No one has  
written with comments on the  
issues she has presented.  
Several people have admired  
her hair. A couple of men  
have written her that they  
have fallen in love with her.  
Once, in a spirit of irony, a  
woman sent a poem (reprinted  
below) about motherhood ""from  
her collection."" Wendy said,  
""I read it as straight as I  
could and wanted a copy of the  
poem.""

What is a mother?

A mother is soft hands and a  
warm heart.

A mother has lots of tears,  
She never runs out of them.

A mother is different.  
She never takes the last chop  
on the plate.

She likes chicken backs and  
necks.  
Dad and the kids don't.

When a mother dies, she goes  
to heaven.  
The coveted job of all:  
Sitting on soft, white,  
fluffy clouds  
Holding the angelic babies  
And wiping away their celestial tears  
With the corner of her apron.

Wendy feels she is not taken  
seriously by the men at  
the TV station and says she  
is not treated as a regular  
part of the staff. She is  
never invited to office parties  
or get-togethers, and is  
not treated with friendliness  
""as though it would not be  
proper."" But, she says, ""any  
time I pull a goof they all  
love me."" Wendy says she  
""detests dresses,"" but one  
week when she substituted on  
another show, her clothes  
were supplied by a local  
dress shop. One day she wore  
a light blue dress complete  
with ruffles and lace. She  
wore her hair in pigtails.  
She says she felt like a 5-year-old  
on her way to a birthday party.  
When she arrived at the station, one  
of the men said, ""Now you  
look like a real woman.""

Three people wrote in.  
And there she gets the most."

'Feminist Librarian Rescues

When Barb Caron began her  
job as the librarian in the  
Alexandria, Minnesota public  
library, she found that books  
like Portnoy's Complaint,  
Black Like Me, yoga and health  
books were kept behind the  
counter, and Gone with the

by anyone under 18.

Solid Friends  

After the course was over,  
the women decided to keep  
meeting as a consciousness-  
raising group. They have  
since formed solid friend-  
ships and ""helped each other  
through rough spots."" Barb  
says the group ""made me more  
comfortable with myself and  
gave me reinforcement."" The  
group is now thinking of  
forming a speakers bureau.  

Barb has been introducing  
feminism to almost everyone  
in Alexandria. She teaches  
a mini-course in cooking to  
eight students from the local  
grade school. The course  
was open to everyone, but  
boys were the only ones who  
signed up!  

Expansion and Outreach  

Barb, who graduated in 1972  
from the College of St. Cath-  
erine, has revitalized the  
library physically as well as  
ordering new books. Along  
with a progressive Library  
Board, she has ordered new  
carpeting, shrubs, and paint.  

She has also expanded the  
library's services. She is

One of her favorite activi-  
ties was an adult education  
class on women called ""You've

100 Boots Out of a Job  

Terminal Island, Calif.  

Eleanor  
Antin, has earned herself an  
exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art  
(MOMA), New York, through an ingen-  
ious ongoing mailwork.  

100 Boots, a series of 50 postcards  
showing black rubber boots in drama-  
tic situations, is on view at MOMA  
through July 8—when the boots them-  
selves conclude their peripatetic ad-  
ventures with a stay in New York. In  
addition to the entire set of post-  
cards, the exhibition includes photo-  
graphic blow-ups of the boots' New  
York “crash pad.""  

Executed over the past 2 1/2 years,  
Antin's 100 Boots was conceived as a  
means of circumventing the limitations  
of the gallery system. The postcards  
have been mailed at irregular inter-  
vals—ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks  
—to some thousand persons and insti-  
tutions around the world.  

As Antin describes it, she origin-  
ally thought of the work as a picar-  
esque novel, but later began to view  
the photographs as highlighted frames  
from a movie serial. Each postcard in-  
cludes a photograph of the boots,  

a title and data on the place and time  
of the photographs. All photographs  
were taken by Philip Steinmetz.  

The postcards were not necessar-  
ily mailed in sequence of occurrence.  
Instead, Antin reordered the events  
into a continuous narrative, which be-  
gins with the boots in conventional  
society, leads through their first  
crime (""100 Boots Trespass"") and  
thence to a series of adventures, odd  
jobs and even an unhappy love affair.  

While most of the boots’ adventures  
have taken place in California (where  
Antin lives), their exploits will con-  
clude in New York when the MOMA ex-  
hibition closes. Jane Necol of the  
MOMA staff directed the exhibition,  
which is the first time the boots'  
wanderings will be fully displayed.

Lack of funds and the stig-
ma of being branded “the
other rape center"" has forced
the feminist-oriented Rape
Crisis Center to close its
doors for the summer, but
staff members have indicated
an intention to reopen the
service after extensive re-
organization.

Joan Orke and Diane Sjer-
ven, in announcing the cen-
ter's temporary closure, laid
the blame to the center's
image as the area's second
rape counseling service. A
rape center at the Neighbor-
hood Involvement Program
(NIP) clinic, a social ser-
vice project of several
churches, opened slightly
before the Rape Crisis Cen-
ter.

Because of the existence
of two apparently similar
centers, funding agencies
""don't want to fund us, be-
cause they think it's a du-
plication of services,"" com-
plained Sjerven. “From their
point of view, it may be--
but there's a real difference
in the way rape victims are
treated at the two centers.”

Orke and Sjerven related
for ""Gold Flower"" the com-
plicated series of events
which led, last winter, to
the almost simultaneous es-
tablishment of two rape cen-
ters in Minneapolis.

According to Orke, who has
been active since last fall
in the movement to aid rape
victims, a women's group at
that time decided to open an
advocacy service patterned
upon the Washington, D.C.,
rape center. One member of
the group arranged a meeting
with the NIP management, to
explore the possibility of
assistance from that group.

The Chicago Women's Liberation

When after extensive meet-
ings it became evident that
the two groups had different
philosophic intent, the wo-
men's group withdrew from
the NIP collaboration and
continued its plans indepen-
dently. NIP, however, estab-
lished its own center, open-
ing last December.

The Rape Crisis Center
opened in January--""probably
too soon,"" Orke admitted.
""But we felt pressured to
supply this choice of ser-
vices to women.

""We believe that women who
are raped should be able to
determine what's going to
happen to her, that she
should not be automatically
referred to counseling. NIP
is a counseling center; we
are an advocacy service. And
we also approach the issue
from a feminist point of
view.""

Rape Crisis Center volun-
teers serve as advocates for
rape victims at the hospital
and police station, should
the victim request this ser-
vice. Volunteers also have
supplied transportation for
rape victims to safety.
Neither of these services are
offered by the NIP center.

""The main difference be-
tween the centers is the long
range goals,"" Sjerven said.
""We're interested in social
change. NIP is interested
only in treating the sym-
ptoms.""

Since January the Rape
Crisis Center has operated
out of the Women's Counsel-
ing Service at Lyndale Ave.
and Lake St. However, lack
of funds has necessitated a
move by that agency to smal-

Lack of funds forces Rape

ler quarters, and the Rape
Crisis Center lost its free
office space as a result.
With no funding and the
sudden need to rent space
for the center, the Rape
Crisis Center staff elected
to shut down its services
pending reorganization.
""Basically we still feel
a need for a 24-hour answer-
ing service, and to provide
advocacy as well as counsel-
ing,"" Orke said. Other
hoped-for services include
a library of rape-related
research, compilation of
statistics on occurrence of
rape in the Twin Cities
area, and a public education
program.

Sociologist says
rapists plan
their assaults

A Detroit sociologist, Nor-
man S. Goldner, reported re-
cently that his studies show
most rapes to be planned by
the attacker, a contention
that calls into question sev-
eral common presuppositions
about the crime.

Goldner's research results
were released recently in a
report by Susan Fogg of New-
house News Service.

According to Goldner, ""pro-
vocation by the victim only
needs to be minimal"" when the
rapist is already determined
to commit the act. This runs
counter to the popular belief
that women are implicated in
the crime through their
arousal of their attacker's
sexual interest--a belief
that leads police to care-
fully question a victim as to
her attire and responses when
attacked.

Goldner reported the crime
to be generally premeditated,
rarely spontaneous. The Wayne
State sociologist found in
studies of the crime that
few rapists (only 18 percent)
leave their own neighborhoods
in search of victims, pre-
ferring instead to strike in
a familiar locale.

Calling rape ""the only
crime I know of in which the
victim must prove herself in-
nocent,"" Goldner said, ""The
victim's only complicity may
be that she turned up at the
wrong place at the wrong
time. The only provocation
may be something she can't
help--like her age."""

How to Have Intercourse...
Without Getting Screwed

Part V: Disease

Venereal Diseases

A venereal disease is one that is transmit-
ted only through sexual contact, genital,
oral, or anal. Both major types, syphilis
and gonorrhea, can be cured easily if treated
in the early stages, but both can result in
permanent disability or death if untreated.

SYPHILIS

Symptoms: A symptom of the primary, or
first, stage of syphilis is the appearance of
a small sore or ""chancre"" on either the geni-
tal area or the anus, or even on lips, tongue,
and fingers. It appears from ten days to
three months after exposure to the disease
and may disappear without treatment after a
few days. This does not mean that the disease
has gone away; it has entered a secondary
stage, where it is highly contagious and can
do crippling damage to the body. In the sec-
ondary stage, symptoms include rashes, sore
throat, sore joints, headache, fever, and en-
larged glands. These symptoms may come and
go over a period of years. These symptoms
also eventually will disappear without treat-
ment. In the final stage of the disease, no
visible symptoms exist. However, untreated
syphilis will persist and ultimately can lead
to blindness, insanity, paralysis, heart dis-
ease, or death. A pregnant woman who has
syphilis can pass it on to newborn children,
who may be stillborn or blind.

Diagnosis and treatment: Certain diagnosis
can only be made through blood tests. These
are available without charge through public
health agencies in Seattle and most other
large cities. Through the use of penicillin,
syphilis can be successfully treated in its
early stages, and in the later stages, the
destructive processes can be stopped by treat-
ment.

GONORRHEA

Symptoms: Gonorrhea (""the clap"") is usually
limited to the genitourinary organs, and it
is in these organs that the symptoms appear.
Female symptoms include pain upon urination,
inflammation of the rectum, swollen glands in
the genital area, and vaginal discharge.

More serious symptoms may occur, such as in-
flammation of the reproductive organs. How-
ever, a woman may have no symptoms at all,
except for slight discomfort while urinating,
and still be a highly contagious carrier of
the disease. The symptoms in males are more
obvious and include a burning sensation during
urination and a discharge of yellow pus. Fur-
ther complications include bladder infections
and a hard, tender swelling in the scrotum.

In both males and females, the untreated dis-
ease can lead to peritonitis, sterility, ar-
thritis, or irritation of the joints, and it
can affect the heart. Women can experience
additional complications that include a gen-
eralized infection of the uterus and ovarian
tubes called pelvic inflammatory disease.

This is associated with pain, fever, and ab-
cesses in the tubes, sometimes known as ""pus
tubes.""

Diagnosis and treatment: Gonorrhea is
usually diagnosed by use of laboratory tests
performed on discharge from infected organs.
Treatment at an early stage can cure the in-
fection. Women who are sexually active should
request an intracervical smear test for
gonorrhea at the same time they have a Pap
smear test.

PROTECTION FROM VENEREAL DISEASES

Venereal diseases are highly contagious and
highly dangerous. The only device that pro-
tects against venereal diseases is the condom,
and this does not offer complete protection!
Previous successful treatment for a venereal
disease is no protection against reinfection.
Since no immunity develops, people can be re-
infected. The only reliable protection
against a disabling venereal disease is infor-
mation and prompt treatment when symptoms are
present.

Although the symptoms of syphilis and gonor-
rhea have been described above, it is impos-
sible to diagnose oneself. Laboratory tests
are necessary. If you have any symptoms or
have reason to believe that you have been ex-
posed to venereal disease, see one of the

Getting Screwed"" was published by the

ington, in January 1972. The second

Washington. Authors are Lynn K. Hansen,

public health agencies available in this
city, or see your private physician.

Because of the severity of venereal disease
epidemics in some cities and because of its
destructive potential, we react to the very
term ""venereal disease"" with fear and dis-
taste. And we may associate the disease with
people who are ""unclean,"" ""unhealthy,"" or
""promiscuous."" Venereal disease can strike
any sexually active individual. The only
stigma associated with venereal disease falls
on those who allow it to go untreated, there-
by endangering themselves, sexual partners,
and yet-unborn children.

A final note: If you acquire a venereal
disease, be sure to inform your sexual part-
ner so that he or she can obtain treatment.

Infections
VAGINITIS

Vaginitis is any inflammation of the vagina—
inflammation due to irritation, to infection,
or to some process that disturbs normal phy-
siology. Anything which interferes with the
protective mechanism normally present in the
vagina causes vaginitis.

The most common complaints associated with
vaginitis are pain, vaginal discharge, itch-
ing, and burning.

VAGINAL DISCHARGE

Some vaginal discharge is normal. This
normal discharge may increase with the use of
the birth-control pill, especially sequen-
tials, and with emotional stress. However,
vaginal discharge also may be caused by in-
fection or chemical or mechanical irritation.
These are listed below.

Infections that cause vaginal discharge:
gonorrhea, trichomonas, monilia, mycoplasma,
and mixed infections.

Chemical and mechanical irritants that cause
vaginal discharge: douches, if too often or
too strong; feminine hygiene sprays; foams,
vaginal creams, and gels (occasionally);
soaps and bubble baths (sometimes); and
foreign objects, such as lost tampons or
dirty fingers.

As a general rule, to guard against vaginal
irritation, don't put anything in your vagina
that you wouldn't put in your mouth.

TRICHOMONAL VAGINITIS (“TRICH”)

Trichomonas vaginalis is a parasite (proto-
zoa) that is spread by sexual contact. In
males, the organism may live under the fore-
skin, in the urethra, or in the prostate
gland. In women, the organism may be found
in the vagina or the cervix and sometimes in
the urethra or the bladder.

Men often have no symptoms. Women have
itching and usually a discharge that is thin,
yellow-greenish, frothy, and smelly.

Since the infecting organism is transmitted
by sexual contact, both female and male part-
ners must be treated. Treatment is an oral
medication, Flagyl, which is expensive but ef-
fective. Vaginal suppositories also may be
prescribed. Like other sexually transmitted
diseases, prevention depends on infected
people being treated. Men who have been ex-
posed but not treated can protect their part-
ners by using a condom.

MONILA VAGINITIS (CANDIDA, YEAST)

Monilia vaginitis is caused by a yeast-like
organism, candida, that is normally found in
the bowel and on the skin and is commonly
found in the vagina.

Many women harbor candida without symptoms.
Symptomatic yeast infections are common in
pregnancy, in diabetes, in women using the
pill, premenstrually, and sometimes after
diarrhea. In women, the symptoms include
vaginal itching and a discharge, which is us-
ually white, may be thick or thin, and is
sometimes curdy like cottage cheese. It is
usually not smelly. Men will occasionally get
a rash or irritation on the penis.

Treatment with specific antimonilial creams
or suppositories may be prescribed. Sometimes
an at-home use of a vinegar douche (one table-
spoon of vinegar in a pint of lukewarm water
is sufficient). Symptoms often recur, even
after treatment. Continuous good hygiene is
helpful in preventing monilia. Cotton under-
pants that absorb moisture may prevent symp-
toms. However, yeast infections can occur
even when the best rules of hygiene are prac-

*Syphilis may be transmitted congenitally
if the pregnant mother has venereal disease
and is not treated. It also can be trans-
mitted by contact to small children and
babies.

Almost 80 percent of infected females
are asymptomatic carriers; that is, they
are contagious and transmit the disease
but have no symptoms.

While women who carry the infecting or-
ganism, mycoplasma, usually do not have
symptoms, mycoplasma can produce vaginal
discharge in women. This condition is very
difficult to diagnose in women. It must be
diagnosed in the male partner, who then
brings the infected woman for treatment.

PENILE DISCHARGE

Urethral discharge can occur in men. Com-
mon causes of penile discharge are gonorrhea,
occasionally trichomonas, and non-specific
urethritis (NSU).

Nonspecific urethritis occurs primarily in
males. It usually is caused by an organism
called mycoplasma. It is sexually transmit-
ted, often from asymptomatic females. The
symptoms are burning on urination and a dis-
charge that is similar to that of gonorrhea.
Since the organism producing NSU is difficult
to detect in a laboratory test, diagnosis of
NSU is made by ruling out gonorrhea. However,
when it is correctly diagnosed, NSU responds
well to treatment by antibiotics. A seven-
to-ten day treatment is usually successful.

BLADDER INFECTIONS (CYSTITIS)

Cystitis is usually caused by bacteria
found in the lower gastro-intestinal tract
(the rectum), the skin, or the vagina. The
major symptoms are burning sensation during
urination with high frequency and urgency,
and, at times, bloody urine. Cystitis often
occurs in otherwise healthy young women who
recently have become sexually active; hence,
it is sometimes called ""honeymoon cystitis.""
It may be caused, in part, by the swelling
and irritation of the urethra during inter-
course, with resultant bacterial contamination
of the bladder. If the infection is not
treated with antibiotics, it may progress to
involvement of the kidneys. However, it is
easy to diagnose and responds well to treat-
ment.

Pubic Lice

Pubic lice, also known as ""crotch lice"" or
""crabs,"" live in the pubic hair of human be-
ings and feed on blood. They also can survive
in the underarm hair, in the hair around the
nipples, in beards, or in eyebrows. Pubic
lice are transmitted through sexual contact.
Often, the first sign of their presence is
itching in the affected areas. Furthermore,
if you look for them, they are not hard to
see. The eggs (nits) look like small freck-
les. After they have hatched, they can be
recognized as tiny vermin. The nits are
visible as tiny translucent lumps attached to
the base and shaft of the pubic hairs, which
look like pussy willows. After they hatch,
they are mobile. (See drawing.)

Pubic lice are easy to exterminate. Two
applications of gamma benzene hexachloride
(Kwell), which is available by prescription,
should be shampooed into the affected areas.
The preparation begins to work quickly and
will eliminate the lice within a day or two.
Since lice cannot live apart from their human
host, any lice on clothing or linen will die
in twenty-four hours. But to be on the safe
side, you should launder clothing and linen
after treatment has started.

Without Getting Screwed  

Herpes Simplex  

Herpes simplex is a virus which can be  
spread by sexual contact (oral, genital, or  
anal). It is characterized by blisters on  
the skin or mucous membrane. These may itch  
when they are erupting and later become pain-  
ful. The blisters look like and are related  
to cold sores.  

In women the sores occur primarily on the  
labia but also within the vagina. In men  
they can appear on the penis or scrotum. The  
blisters last eight to ten days and do tend  
to recur.  

There are no known cures for herpes simplex.  
However, the discomfort can be reduced through  
Burrows soaks, ice pack, or heat. The sores  
should be encouraged to be dry. Some  
physicians also recommend Glyoxide or Orabase  
(a medication for canker sores), which can be  
purchased at drugstores without a prescrip-  
tion.  

Pap Test  

The Pap test is a laboratory test of a  
sample of cells from the cervix and the upper  
vagina taken during a pelvic examination. This  
test is a valuable diagnostic tool and can  
give early warning of cervical or uterine can-  
cer. Contrary to public opinion, cervical and  
uterine cancer can occur in young women. Can-  
cer is more apt to occur in women who are  
sexually active than in virgins, and it has  
been shown to be associated with having multi-  
ple sex partners, starting at an early age.  
However, cervical and uterine cancer can  
occur in sexually inexperienced women as  
well. All women should have a Pap test once  
a year. If tests for two consecutive years  
show no disorder, however, young women can  
skip two to three years before being retested.  
Tests are given free at many public health  
facilities.

campus. Both are free and confidential, and  
no information will be given to parents or  
University officials.  

Hall Health Center offers both medical help  
and psychiatric counseling. The staff pro-  
vides counseling on contraception, sexual  
problems, the decision to terminate a preg-  
nancy, and post-abortion concerns. A major  
advantage of Hall Health is that its staff  
can treat any physical aspects of your  
problems while giving psychiatric and social  
counseling.  

The Counseling Center in Schmitz Hall  
offers help for problems of an emotional or  
social nature. The Center is not set up to  
provide long-term therapy, and most patients  
will be limited to eight to ten visits, ex-  
cept in rare cases. The types of problems  
with which they deal are fear of homosexuali-  
ty, frigidity, impotence, and adjustment to  
school.  

If these services cannot help you directly,  
they will assist you to locate the free or  
low-cost community agencies that can help.  

OFF CAMPUS  

Several off-campus sources of sexual  
counseling are available in the Seattle area.  
In addition to those that provide general

Americans Still Pursue by Mary Hastings

‘Bliss Machine” and “Perpetual Plastic”

Little Chapel of the Flowers  
""...nestled between a Texaco  
station and the Yucca Motel.""  
The typical Las Vegas wedding  
offers a couple (for an addi-  
tional fee) a white rose cor-  
sage, a license with a white  
bow and “artificial greenery and  
flowers"" or “perpetual plastic""  
in Las Vegas parlance.

Perhaps we have been wrong.  
We who have taken the institu-  
tion of marriage seriously. We  
who have taken it seriously in a  
number of ways: By fighting it,  
by striving for it, by trying to  
change it.

It has become clear to me  
that those individuals who plac-  
idly accept marriage as a ""sine  

qua non"", who readily take those  
vows and comfortably break them,  
really have the proper attitude  

toward marriage.

Now comes Marcia Seligson  
and her book, The Eternal Bliss  
Machine, (304 pp., William  
Morrow & Company, Inc., $7.95).  
She confirms my suspicion that  
marriage is, at best, a form  

to be ignored. Seligson's  

book is subtitled, ""America's  
Way of Wedding"". And the auth-  
or attempts to exhaust the top-  
ic of marriage as did Jessica  
Mitford that of death in The  
American Way of Death. Selig-  
son fails in her attempt.

Do we laugh or cry? At  
this point, I choose to laugh.  
I cannot take marriage seri-  
ously. I was mildly surprised  
when I finished this book to  
find that I could care less  
about marriage or the author's  
revelation--telegraphed early  
in the book--that more Amer-  
icans than ever are marrying.  
My not very nice reaction is:  
Let them.

customs. Under such chapter  
headings as ""The Love Machin-  
ery,"" ""The Dream Brokers"" and  
""All Decked in White"", Selig-  
son shares with us:

Perhaps joining one's life  
with another is more subject-  
ive, thus less readily quanti-  
tated, than is the great ob-  
jectifier, death. And per-  
haps the author's own bias (to  
view matrimony with some amuse-  
ment) precludes a ""weighty""  
tone. At any rate, Seligson's  
book emerges as a sometimes  
amusing, usually interesting  
report on the author's person-  
al observations as ""member of  
the wedding"".

--The spectacle of a young  
bride scaling a step ladder to  
the top of her wedding cake  
and handily wielding a large,  
silver knife to produce the  
first, symbolic (?) slice of  
cake.

M. Hastings

Seligson begins with a cul-  
tural anthropologist's view of  
Marriage. Although these first  
two chapters are deceptively  
earnest, the author does re-  
veal: 

--The Jewish wedding with  
the ‘flying chuppa' (either a  
symbol of the groom's tent or  
the couple's new home) where  
doves were contained over the  
canopy, released with a flour-  
ish--at the ""I do"" and all  
floated to the floor--dead.""

The University of Minn-

sponsor Summer Session  

rap groups for women stu-

unity members.

--The first marriage con-  
sisted in a male of one  
tribe raiding another  
tribe, kidnapping a female  
and carrying her off.

--The gold wedding band  

is a symbol of the tether  
around the female's waist  
to facilitate capture.  
(Alas for the vapours  

of Victorian poets and pre-  
1963 songwriters.)

Group meetings will  
start in late June and will  
be held in Health Service  

meeting rooms.

The sessions will be  
staffed by two women from  
the Center and two women  
from the Health Service.  
Groups will form accord-  
ing to participants’ con-  
sciousness. Each group  
will meet about two hours  
per week.

--The primitive male mind  
anchored in endless terrors  
of the unknown, feared wo-  
men perhaps above all else.  
All the aspects of female-  
ness--in their enigmatic  
difference from the male  
structure and function--  
became sources of dread.""

Minds Come Together

— Robin Morgan

by Diana L. Antolik

I want a women’s revolution like a lover

I lust for it, I want so much this freedom
this end to struggle and fear and lies

we all exhale, that I could die just

with the passionate uttering of that desire,

Robin Morgan
Monster

May 30 and other notes; My mind has
been whirling ever since I left the Robin
Morgan Lecture. Lecture is not the word.
The word is some never-ending infinitely
high-pitched scream,

Tonight in a packed auditorium, a
gigantic auditorium, I felt something I
never had before. A super-consciousness of
energies, of emotions, of minds coming to-
gether.

I don't know if it was a lecture. Even
though it was labeled by the University 100-73-
803 The Emergence of Feminist Culture by
Robin Morgan. It seemed like a CR session
with over five hundred people.

Poet in Chem Lab

At seven thirty there was only a small
group of women in the Murphy Hall Auditor-
ium but more and more came. First in small
groups and finally in a flood. Every seat
was taken and there were women sitting two
abreast in the aisles and still more people
coming in. An advocacy for a spirit of love
and sisterhood to put up with the cramped
conditions until something could be worked
out was made. The request was unneeded.
The spirit existed from the start. Finally
the lecture was moved to a Chemistry hall
and there were still people sitting in the
aisles.

Morgan made comment on the setting in
the opening: ""There are a number of chapters
in Shulamith's book,"" (Shulamith Firestone's
The Dialectic of Sex) ""in which she talks
about the patriarchal style compartmental-
ization. That is you have art over here and
science over there. It is very apt given
the theme I am trying to talk about under
all that. It's strange but it's apt.""

Illness Due to Split

The lecture progressed too swiftly.
Morgan started threading her loom in the beg-
inning in which she was weaving the radical
ideas.

""On the relation of feminist culture and
feminist politics to me the relation between
feminist culture and feminist politics
doesn't exist because feminist culture and
feminist politics are inseparable and in-
deed synonymous.

“The feminist movement is about bridges
between things. At one point there was no
difference between art and science, between
thought and feeling, between intellect and
action. And that profound and deep illness
of our society and not just our society
but the patriarchy globally is due I would
say primarily to that split.""

Reactions....

Spending the rest of the night after the
Robin Morgan Lecture awake and writing I
started to wonder around dawn how other women
had reacted during the night hours. So I
started to ask some of the feminists that I
was coming in contact with during the day.
Few of them said that they didn't go and the
reason then was because of work. But those
that did attend were shaken to say the least.

""I sat up and played two or three games
of chess. I hardly ever play chess,"" was the
reaction of one woman.

""I just sat and thought. Like I was in
a trance,"" was another woman's reaction.

""Some friends and I sat up most of the
night rapping --- there was so much there,""
was another's statement.

Some of the women could not utter the
thoughts inside of them. Others talked. Some
could not relate to any questions asked by
males they were in contact with. Others
rapped with friends until the grey hours of
the morning.

Through other sources, though (male) I did
find one middle-aged, balding pervert who
explained, ""Oh, yeah, Gloria Steinem, naw, it
was Robin Morgan this time, yeah I saw her.
She's the one who talks of castrating men.
Well she's ""funny"" (I have the feeling that
he meant a Lesbian since there was that
ringing ""you-know-what-I-mean-so-I-don't-
have-to-say-the-word"" quality in his voice.)

And this whole women’s thing -~- it'll never
make it.""

Personal = Political

And later Morgan progressed further
with her point by continuing, ""I think one
of the primary places where the reintegration
has begun, and that is another pulse
beat of the feminist movement, is now the
classic phrase 'the personal is political.'

""For women who have been confined to
the ‘personal sphere' the personal is very
political. I could cite ten million
examples as could any woman in this room.
Just a few bases to touch. The housewife
is considered by the establishment a non-
worker. On a quiz show they say, ‘Honey
do you work or are you just a housewife?'
The average housewife works a 99.6 hour work
week.""

Not After Equality

And finally after progressing through
many more examples of both the male right
and the male left she brought together the
heart of the thought. ""And then there is
the area which I would call radical femin-
ism where there is one priority and that is
women. All women. We are not after equal-
ity with men. The notion makes me want to
throw up. We are not interested in becoming"
GoldFlower,2,3,june 1973,14,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No3_page014.txt,"more like men, or doing what it is men do  
in this culture. But on the contrary  
changing that whole concept as well.  

""We are not after equality or tokenism  
whether it is Margaret Chase Smith or  
Bernadine Dorn. We are, in fact, after  
power... 5""  

""I am not talking about reforming the  
system or revising the system or making the  
patriarchy nice or some kind of wonderful  
humanistic glow. I am talking about a world-  
wide feminist revolution. And in fact a  
gynocracy in which women own all secular and  

Robin Morgan Continued  

I am talking about rage which is right and  
justifiable and firm and beautiful. A right  
to 'man hating' as a class. Because the  
class of men, as oppressors, hurt and the  
class of women, as oppressed, have a right to  
hate where that hurt is coming from. Taking  
one's own feelings seriously enough to go as  
far as they will take one. And you can't do  
that alone because you will think that you  
are going mad in the old way. That is why we  
need each other and that is why we need a  
feminist culture.""  

And finally the long poem Monster which  

religious power.""  
A Beautiful Madness  

This statement along with the rational  
conclusion that there will most likely be  
some type of bloodshed is one of the long-  

est and most audible screams.  
came to talking about madness.  

Until Morgan  

Morgan has written. One of the women I talked  
to said that during the reading of Monster  

crying.  

""The need for madness in the face of the  

patriarchy is a very valid one.  

I mean  

something very concrete. ...If what in the  
patriarchy is sane I am wooing madness. ...  

she noticed women openly breaking down and  

May we go mad together, my sisters  

May our labor agony in bringing forth this revolution  
Be the death of all pain  

May we comprehend we cannot be stopped

GoldFlower,2,5,August 1973,3,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No5_page003.txt,"Happy Hooking  
Prostitution Two Views  

Diana L. Antolik  

When two authors approach any subject, be it brushing teeth or doing wash; to solving  
world economic problems or the evolution of a species there are bound to be differences.  
Differences of style, viewpoint, and understanding of the subject matter the author is  

to get across.  

This is an accepted fact in writing. If not there wouldn't be so many books in exist-  
ence today. But when both of the authors are women dealing with the same subject, in this  
case prostitution, one of them is most likely to come out of the acceptance duel with a  

black eye.  

Hollander  

Xaviera! How well such a strange name  
is remembered! And how most of us remem-  
ber the first book Ms. Hollander brought  
into being, The Happy Hooker.  

""Xaviera! Her continuing adventures...""  
“The Girl Who's Gone Wrong--And Loves It  
-~-Is Back!"" Xaviera Hollander is back  
with another scorcher, is only because of  
the electric pink cover and title Xaviera  
(Warner Paperback Library, 428 pp. $1.50)  

""As in The Happy Hooker I've written in  
the first person as though I am talking to  
the reader as a friend; a personal inti-  
mate conversation,"" Hollander states in a  
blurb on the back of her book. It is an  
intimate conversation, but I have the feel-  
ing that the most intimate thing that passes  
between the two of us is my money.  

The dealings in  
prostitution that  
Hollander writes  
about is a life  
style that is very  
easy, relaxed, and  
very profitable.  

There is no real  

reference to drugs,  

except in passing,  

pimps, ""underworld  

dealings"", or the  

real hassles with  

the police or the legal systems.  

these omissions which gives the book an un-  
realistic fantasy-like glow. For with all  
the fun and games logic tells anyone that  
there should be a little rain falling some-  
where.  

The tone of the book is light and there  
are many incidents where, (since this is a  
personal story it is all quite possible)  
the people and interactions do not follow  
any sequence. The only help the reader has  
in solving her ""what-is-really-happening""  
bafflement is an Editor's note that states:  
""The material in this book is not being  
presented in any specific chronological  
order. Some of the things occurred at the  
same time. Such is the style of Ms. Hol-  
lander's life."" And such, also is the style  
of her writing. Disjointed to a point of  
distraction.  

The book takes life, women, relation-  
ships, and men with a grain of salt. There  
is not even the slightest indication that  
any of it is real. There is no substance  
to any person besides Hollander herself.  
So one can begin to wonder about the val-  
idity of the book by the second chapter.  

If joking prostitution and pink covers  
and shocking come-ons are sellable to  
the public then Xaviera will sky-rocket.  

Millett  

""I also found that the knowledge of an-  
other's experience places vast moral re-  
sponsibility upon you, since the very  
knowledge of another if deep and authentic  
constitutes great obligations.”  

""...So that the experience of all women  
everywhere becomes, in a sense, our com-  
munal property, a heritage we bestow upon  
each other, the knowledge of what it has  
meant to be female—a woman in this man's  
world.""  

With these two passages as with the rest  
of the introductions in Kate Millett's  
The Prostitution Papers: A Candid Dialogue  
(Avon Books, 160 pp. $1.25) are laid the  
basic groundwork for what I feel is one  
of the most honest works on prostitution  
to be written in a long time, if ever.  
The book is divided  
into four sections  
with a different  
woman speaking in  
each.  

Though the variat-  
ions presented by  
each woman is dif-  
ferent because of  
the diverse in-  
volvement there is  
a very strong under-  
current that affirms  
that for each woman the basic script remains  
the same while the sets and specific dia-  
logue changes.  

Unlike most books that deal with ""touchy""  
areas Millett does not hide what either  
herself; Liz Schneider, a lawyer; or ""M"" and  
""J"", two former prostitutes have to say be-  
hind some high-falutin academic rhetoric of  
charts and figures. But instead deals with  
the women involved and their reactions at  

a personal level.  

Millett serves as a buffer, sounding board  
and reporter. Even though this is ""her"" book  
she keeps her personal insights and comments  
well out of the way of what the story of  
the other women is. Her reporting is of  
a recognizable style, editing down the  
""authors"" until the written language is similar  
to what was actually spoken.  

And what is spoken by all women is grim.  
Yes, at one time in the lives of both ""J""  
and ""M"" there was a time when selling your-  
self was not all that bad, as they both state  
it was even slightly rosy for a time. But  
it all changes into the ""underground"" of  
drugs, police and total alienation from al-  
most every part of a somewhat normal daily  
existence."

Breakthrough

The Helen Reddy Show included this kind of exchange every week it was on the air. Like Ms. magazine, the show was slick, controversial and extremely well done. And, hopefully, like Ms. magazine, it got to more and more people as the summer wore on. I am not one of those who feel that because something is popular, then it must be of poor quality. I do have friends who refuse to read books on the best sellers list simply because “everyone"" is reading them. (“Everyone"" in this context sounds kind of like ""the plebians""). The more people who saw the Helen Reddy Show, the better. As I watched Ms. Reddy hold up her fist and say something like ""keep fighting, sisters"", I felt that an important development had occurred in the history of the media. Beside the fact that the show had a woman producer and a large number of female crew members, which are notable breakthroughs in themselves, what actually went on in front of the cameras seemed even more remarkable.

Natural Style

There was Helen Reddy herself. She appeared in marked contrast to every other singer or variety show hostess I've seen on similar productions. Unlike Cher, of Sonny and Cher, she did not depend on fantastic clothes or wild hairstyles or undulating movements for her appeal. She was natural in every sense of the word, from her straight hair, to her quiet singing style, to the way she held her body. Ms. Reddy spoke directly to the audience without a hint of coyness or pretension. As I listened to her musical speaking voice, I wondered if an American performer could do as well. Perhaps, there is something in her Australian background that enables Helen Reddy to have her own show without becoming encumbered with false glamour, flashy sets or the skin-tight gowns of almost every other female singer.

Women Get Together

The show itself was different from any other. It was warm, chatty, funny and touching, and it was nothing like the sappy sugary stuff that characterized the Glen Campbell approach on a similar set. The guests included Brenda Vaccaro, the Pointer Sisters, Ruth Buzzi, and, in what seemed a historical event, Gloria Steinem. As I sat watching Ms. Steinem read a biting feminist newscast (When the Republicans hired call girls to infiltrate the Democratic Convention as spies, they increased their female employment rate by 150%) I had to keep reminding myself: this is prime time TV: As I sat watching Betty Wright singing ""I Am Woman"", I kept thinking how beautifully this defied all those tiring articles about how black and white women couldn't get together.

Questions

But the part of the show that seemed unusual to me was when Helen and her guests sat on the stage and answered questions: ""When did you stop wearing a bra?"" ""Don't you think women want to stay in the home?"" Ms. Reddy and her guests answered these questions directly and without embarrassment. On the final show, during this part, a pimply-faced boy asked, nervously, if he could come up and kiss each of the women. He was told he could do so and, somehow as I watched him kiss each woman on the cheek, it was not a corny scene or an obscene one.

Touching Lives

I'm not sure a TV show can ever reach people or touch them deeply. That screen separating us and the performers prevents us from experiencing anything live, as in a theater. I am sure that this particular show made me laugh a lot, made me feel better about myself, and a few times, moved me. I admit I am biased. I have been strongly influenced by the women's liberation movement. I support it wholeheartedly. Finally, a show came along that appealed to this bias. It's about time! Sparkling kitchen floors, spotless dishes and giggling sink scrubbers never have appealed to me. So, I guess I deserve this show. All women and men deserve more shows like the Helen Reddy Show. She has come the closest to using television in a non-manipulative way. This demonstrates, to me, that when strong, independent women get some power in this media, they can humanize it, using it in creative ways, perhaps even to touch people's lives.

An Interview with Betty

These are times when refer-
ences to women's ""lib"" and
""libbers"" bespatter our daily
newspapers, yet our ageless
institutions continue grind-
ing their wheels as if the
myth of the weaker sex were
still intact. Credit grant-
ing institutions are among
the most oblivious.

New credit rulings went
into effect on August 1
which should sharpen their
sense of reality. I talked
with Betty Howard, Director
of the Women's Division of
the State Department of Human
Rights to find out what we
can expect from these provi-
sions.

HOW DO THE NEW RULINGS APPLY
TO WOMEN?

Actually, they're intended
to apply to anyone who has
experienced discrimination on
the basis of credit because
of sex. Obviously, women
have been the people who
have suffered most when they
seek credit. But it's pos-
sible that the ""other sex""
might suffer too.

Women who are seeking cre-
dit will be treated fairly
under the new provisions if
the people who are dealing
with her know and abide by
the law...and we certainly
hope they will.

Women and men under the new
provisions must be treated
fairly on the basis of their
ability to meet the estab-
lished criteria, and not with
regard to sex which has hap-
pened in the past. And mari-
tal status too has affected
an individual's right, or op-
portunity, rather, to obtain
credit.

ON WHAT BASIS HAVE WOMEN BEEN
DENIED CREDIT IN THE PAST?

I can tell you what was
said to me a year ago when I
was interviewing some major
credit grantors and officials
of the credit bureaus. When
I asked a similar question,
it appears that people who
grant credit, and the large
majority of these are males,
assume that a woman's parti-
cipation in the labor force
is a temporary thing that ex-
ists only prior to her having
a family. This assumption is
contrary to the statistics of
the Department of Labor of
the United States Government
which indicate that over 40%
of the labor force consists

of women who work an average
of 25 years, whether or not
they're married and whether
or not they have children.

At that time I expressed
the thought that men, parti-
cularly those engaged in the
credit granting business,
needed to be brought into the
twentieth century. One of
the things that was said to
me that is particularly...
amazing in the adjective I'll
use...is that if a woman was
in her childbearing years,
and particularly if she was
younger and attractive, her
chances for getting credit
were reduced correspondingly.
I see by the look on your
face that you react as I do
to this comment.

You know, at the time I
said, ""Have they ever heard
about the Pill, family plan-
ning?"" Actually I suppose
they have, because many women

(when applying for mortgages
with their husbands) have
been asked to sign a state-
ment describing the type of
contraceptive being used and
saying that they do not in-
tend to have children. Can
you imagine anything more
demeaning?

ARE THEY OBLIGATED TO SIGN
STATEMENTS LIKE THAT?

People have been asked to
sign them. Obligated? You
know, when you want a loan
and the guy that's going to
give it to you sits there and
asks you these questions....
Now, that would be illegal,
unless they ask the same
question of men. You must
understand that when you're
dealing with sex discrimina-
tion what you're saying is
that one sex cannot be treat-

ed differently from the other.

So if a major lending insti-
tution would persist in ask-
ing that question of women,
it would also have to ask it
of men. Then it wouldn't be
discriminatory. Well, you
and I both know that they're
not going to ask men that
question.

IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A LONG,
UNRESOLVED DIVORCE. HOW
MIGHT HER UNSTABLE MARITAL
STATUS AFFECT HER APPLICATION
FOR CREDIT?

Now, fortunately, if she
deserves credit and can dem-
onstrate her financial abil-
ity to meet her obligations,

Howard

her marital status should

not affect her credit ability.
But it's happened in the past
and I assume that it's going
to take some time for all of
the people who are in the po-
sition of granting credit to
become familiar with the new
provisions and to accept them.
There may be some built-in
resistance to people who
have operated

resistance to people who

have operated under another
set of beliefs for a long,
long time. In other words,
we're bucking up against tra-
dition, the same old stereo-
types.

But what has happened in
the past, and I was told this
by both major credit bureaus,
is that no matter how long
the woman had been married
and how involved she was in
handling the financial obli-
gations of her family and how
good that credit rating was,
probably due to her efforts...
if she were divorced, this
good credit rating would go
with the husband. She would
be a non-person as far as
credit was concerned. Now,
for the sad part...if the
family had had a bad credit
rating, this would follow her
to her new file.

WOULD IT FOLLOW THE HUSBAND
ALSO?

Supposedly, although I do
know of a case where the
husband went bankrupt. He
had a business which failed,
while the wife had a profes-
sional job. She undertook
the responsibility of paying
off the debts. That's some-
thing people don't under-
stand. A wife is responsi-
ble for her husband's bad
debts just as the husband is
responsible for his wife's
bad debts. You never hear a-
bout that, but it's the law
in Minnesota.

What happened in this par-
ticular case is that the hus-
band went through bankruptcy
and was able to open up an-
other business with the slate
wiped clean. Her record re-
mained with all these blem-
ishes because she had under-
taken to repay all the debts.
So there's been a tremendous
number of inequities which
hopefully will not occur
under the new law.

There are two sections of
this law that apply to people
being able to obtain credit

how does a lesbian express

For centuries popular and
folk music has reflected the
predominantly ""heterosexual/

""Family of Woman"" is a les-
bian-feminist band comprised
of four Chicago area women:
Joan Capra, Judy Handler, Lin-
da Shear and Ella Szekely.
Two technicians, Susan Kahn

music combined as a tool to

""We play for women--
straight or lesbian. But
sometimes we have no say. On
some college campuses we can't
discriminate and men are all-
owed, although we prefer not.""

Capra is a classically tra-
ined violinist. Shear sings
and plays guitar and piano,
Handler sings and plays lead
guitar and Ella Szekely is
the drummer.

None of the band suffers
any conflict between art and
politics.

""We hope to use our poli-
tics and music combined as a
tool to validate lesbian life
styles.""

Capra added that two of
the women in the group write
music and ""Family of Woman""
collects original music writ-
ten by women throughout the
country.

I planned to approach this
review from a strictly femi-
nist viewpoint. I hoped to
discover the extent of the
damage done to Janis Joplin
by our world's expectations
of a woman.

‘Certainly, Janis was “cursed""
with enough traits that our
society condemns in a woman:
Unfortunately, however, it is
impossible to assume a strid-
ently feminist viewpoint when
contemplating the slow sui-
cide of Janis Joplin.

As Friedman points out, the
singer had many opportunities
for love. She drove away
many sincere friends in fav-
or of sickening junkies and
""pretty boys."" She chose to
shoot heroin and drink to
excess. Then she gravitated
to uncaring and uncritical
companions.

Janis possessed many of the
traits of the performer.
When Friedman would walk down
a New York street with her,
she noted Janis' eyes

seeking a glint of recog-
nition of hundreds of pass-
ing eyes.

By the end of her life Janis
was no different from many
performer-idols--she was a
selfish, mean-willed person,
with a pathological inabili-
ty to ever consider anyone
else's comfort above her own.
And she was mightily talented.

I never saw her perform live.
But Friedman's book makes
clear that Janis' moments of
true living occurred on the
stage. There she found the
substance she lacked in her
private life.

Friedman has presented a fas-
cinating picture of the 1960s
rock world; she has detailed
the moods and moves of Janis
Joplin but she has not been
able to give any satisfac-
tory explanation for Janis'
self-hating life.

This failure occurs pre-
cisely because there is no
explanation for Janis Jop-
lin's defects. She suffered
mightily because of un-
realistic demands made on
her womanhood. But many
women have suffered so and
are not selfish monsters.
The fairest assessment of
Janis Joplin as an American
artist and woman is that she
was alive when she sang, and
the rest is only temporarily
significant."

Without Getting Screwed

Part VII

Female Sexuality: A Feminist
Perspective .,

This treatise is the outgrowth of my fem-
inist curiosity about the quality of hetero-
sexual relationships in Western society.
What is the fundamental nature of male-fe-
male relationships as enacted too often
through sexual intercourse? Why do women
engage in coitus?

Substantive factors differentiate the
coital experience for men and for women. In
coitus, men experience a definite physical
release that is usually accompanied by a
more intensive orgasmic release. In short,
men come. Women, on the other hand, do not
necessarily experience orgasm, do not always
come. Statistics vary from the initial Kin-
sey study, which reports that only one-third
of American women experience orgasm during
their first year of marriage, to a recent
study published in Psychology Today of a
supposedly enlightened, sexually free audi-
ence, which reports that 20 percent of the
women never achieve orgasm during inter-
course and another 10 percent achieve orgasm
in only one of four coital experiences.

Further heterosexual discrepancies include
contraception, pregnancy, abortion, and
child care. When and if contraception is
practiced, women are generally responsible.
Women, not men, become pregnant. Women can-
not get legal, medically safe abortions, ex-
cept at unreasonable emotional and financial
costs. Finally, if a child is born, women
bear the primary responsibility for its
care. In sum, in coitus, women do not
necessarily experience physical release or
pleasure; whereas, they do bear tremendous
responsibility.

Sexual attitudes and behavior reflect the
attitudes and behavior that govern any cul-
ture or society. Sexual behavior is symbo-
lic behavior. As Kate Millett puts it in
Sexual Politics:

Coitus can scarcely be said to take
place in a vacuum; although of itself
it appears a biological and physical
activity, it is set so deeply within
the larger context of human affairs
that it serves as a charged microcosm
of the variety of attitudes and
values to which a culture subscribes. 
American society subscribes to the patri-
archy. Its most pervasive ideology is sex-
ual dominion, specifically male supremacy.

""How to Have Intercourse... Without
Getting Screwed"" was published by the
ASUW Women's Commission in Seattle, Wash-
ington, in January 1972. The second
printing was funded by the Graduate and
Professional Student Senate and by the
Associated Students of the University of
Washington. Authors are Lynn K. Hansen,
Barbara Reskin, and Diana Gray.

Anne E. Schwiesow

Two principles are paramount: (a) male
shall dominate female, and (b) elder male
shall dominate younger.
Sex is a status category with political

implications. Sex defines a relationship

of dominance and subordinance; it defines
power-structured relationships in which
one group, men, controls another, women. As
such, it is a model for all other exploitive
systems, for the larger schema of American
politics. The domination of women by men

is a prototype of the control men have tried
to exercise over other men, that groups,
e.g., racial, have tried to exercise over
other groups, that America as a nation has
tried to exercise over other nations.

According to Hannah Arendt, there are two
ways of maintaining or perpetuating any
power structure: by force or by condition-
ing. Through socialization or ""internal
colonization,” most men and most women ac-
cept three basic patriarchal polities or
structures:

1. The first is status: Men are ascribed
superior status; women, inferior status.

2. The second is temperament: The develop-
ment of temperament is based on the needs

of the dominant group (men) and dictated by
what they cherish in themselves and find con-
venient in their subordinates (women). Ac-
cordingly, men are supposed to be rational,
aggressive, intelligent, forceful; women
are supposed to be emotional, passive, ig-
norant, docile, virtuous.

3. The final, and codifying, structure is
role: Women are relegated to menial, domes-
tic labor and to attending children. The
rest of human interest and achievement is
the legitimate concern and dominion of men.

In short, we subscribe to a male supremacist
value system in which the function of the
norm is unthinkingly dictated by, and dele-
gated to, the man; it is a value system
based upon the perpetuation of that which is
convenient for men.

It logically follows that that which is
not convenient for men is not acceptable.
Behavior that is not complementary to male
behavior—normal behavior—is abnormal.
Hence, authentic female behavior (not
defined by, or necessarily in accordance
with, or dependent upon male behavior) is
a priori abnormal. The result is alienation
on the part of most women: alienation from
themselves, in intimate relationships, from
society in general. Women are not rewarded
for being independent, self-determining,
whole human beings. Further, those who dare
to deviate from the norm, those who resist,
or by some accident, miss socialization, are
dealt with by force, the second means of
maintaining the power structure.

GoldFlower,2,5,August 1973,9,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No5_page009.txt,"Feminist Perspective and Cave 3

Within the man's system, coitus blatantly exemplifies sexual politics on an individual or personal level. Women's sexuality has been defined by men to benefit men until women have learned to believe in their own sexual inferiority.

A long-standing myth of western patriarchal society contends that women have a lesser sex drive than men. Krafft-Ebing, a well-known sexologist of a generation ago, said of women:

""...if she is normally developed mentally and well-bred, her sexual desire is small. If this were not so, the whole world would become a brothel and marriage and family impossible. It is certain that the man that avoids women and the woman who seeks men are abnormal.""

A 1869 marriage manual read:

""...There can be no doubt that sexual feeling in the female is, in a majority of cases, in abeyance, and that it requires positive and considerable excitement to be roused at all; and even if roused (which in many instances it never can be), is very moderate, compared with that of the male.""

The correlate to this thought is that, since women have a lesser sexual desire, they do not require as much sexual gratification.

Sexual politics was probably most severely codified by Sigmund Freud. I don't believe he was consciously malicious, but rather the confused legatee of a Jewish Viennese patriarchy. He lamented, on one hand, his inability to understand women, while, on the other, he continually diagnosed, defined, and labeled them: less than men.

According to his psychoanalytic perspective, women were not whole human beings, but mutilated males who longed all their lives for a penis and must compensate for its lack. Further, women did not possess a libido, or sex drive. Libido belonged to men. Hence, women were innately passive; men, active.

Freud believed that during the phallic phase of psychosexual development, both boys and girls shift from a primary focus on the mouth and anus as sources of erotic pleasure to their genitalia, the penis for boys, the clitoris for girls. He considered the clitoris to be an atrophied penis, and he defined girls as ""little boys"" who had literally come too short. However, as the little girl grows up, she must transfer any pleasurable sensations from the clitoris to the vagina, which she discovers later:

""The clitoris in the girl...is in every way equivalent during childhood to the penis....The transition to womanhood very much depends upon the early and complete relegation of this sensitivity from the clitoris over to the vaginal orifice.""

The superiority of vaginal over clitoral orgasm was a particularly useful theory. Clitoral women were labeled immature, neurotic, bitchy, masculine, infantile. Vaginal women, on the other hand, were maternal, feminine, mature, normal. Normal, because it was, and is, convenient for men: Vaginal insertion facilitates, both physiologically and psychologically, orgasm for men. Also, to the degree that women believe in vaginal orgasm, they are dependent upon an erect penis, upon a man. Clitoral orgasm affords sexual pleasure independent of the male.

Vaginal orgasm is a myth. Anatomically, all orgasms are centered in the clitoris. This is not to imply that women do not, and cannot, learn to experience orgasm through vaginal insertion, but that the vagina itself is devoid of nerve endings. Dr. Judd Marnor, representative of one of the newer schools of psychoanalysis, frankly admits:

""...The chief sensory area for erogenous sensation in women is localized in the glans clitoris, just as in men it is localized in the homologous glans penis. (The shaft of the penis, like the vagina, is lacking in genital corpuscles.)...Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as vaginal orgasm in the female, any more than we might speak of scrotal, anal, or prostatic orgasm in the male.""

Even the adjectives vaginal and clitoral create unnecessary confusion. We must eliminate them. Women, like men, experience orgasm.

One final Freudian myth deserves explanation: penis envy. The penis has served for Freud and his followers as the ""unalterable determinant of maleness which women could symbolically envy instead of the power and prestige afforded men in society."" And, this plight was conferred on her, not by men but by God, who created women without a penis. Further, the lack of a penis legitimized her role as wife and mother: She transferred her desire for a penis to a desire for a child, and she was especially fortunate if it were a male child. Hence, she was kept home and in a family way. (The Roman etymology for family, familius, means domestic servants.)

Anthropologists have shown that women's sexual response is culturally conditioned. Margaret Mead contends that whether or not a woman experiences orgasm depends not only on physical factors, but even more on where she happens to have been born and reared:

""...Clearly those societies which believe in orgasms for women and produce orgiastic behavior in them are also the ones which employ effective stimulation techniques...""

The ability to achieve orgasm is a potential; it is a learned response. Almost any woman can experience orgasm if effective stimulation is applied in a favorable social and psychological milieu.

Interestingly, the phenomenon of orgasm as a learned response is applicable to men as well as women. According to Doctors Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, ejaculation does not a priori spell orgasm in men. Ejaculation may produce a physiological tension release, but it is not as great as when ejaculation and orgasm coincide. Because ejaculation and orgasm have several aspects in common and outwardly resemble one another, they have been confused as the same thing. This also suggests that some men may be nonorgasmic. In men we call it impotence, implying an unwillingness to act, rather than frigidity, as in women, implying an inactive passivity that simply froze over.

Historically, however, women have learned from, and deferred to, whatever model of sexuality was prescribed by men. Within the

GoldFlower,2,5,August 1973,10,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No5_page010.txt,"patriarchy, male dominance must be  
maintained, at any cost. The traditional  
""Missionary position,"" still the only legally  
acceptable position in some states, provides  
a striking example. The man lies on top of  
the woman, placing himself literally in the  
superior position and in control of the sex  
act, making it difficult for her to discover  
her own sexuality and, hence, perpetuating  
the notion of female frigidity.  

Female pleasure or satisfaction is not  
intrinsic in the coital act. Too often it  
is founded in pleasing the man. Isn't that  
why he chose her? His romantic love, if it  
does not disguise the injustice of her social  
position, at least makes it palliative.  

Joan Baez referred to these same politics in  
the Resistance when she said: ""Girls say  
'yes' to the boys who say 'no'."" Women are  
dependent upon men to win them social status  
and to determine the way they are viewed by  
the world. Survival for a woman, within the  
power structure, is to please, and hence to  
be chosen by a man. He is the conqueror;  
she, the conquered.  

The woman who does not play sex according  
to the rules, who is not conquerable, is  
dealt forceful or violent treatment. Consider  
the verbal abuse women receive. Women  
who are not ladies (the societal ideal:  
virgins or lawful wives) are bitches, whores,  
sluts, pigs, loose, easy; women who are not  
willing on the spot are uptight, frigid,  
cold, square. Consider the act of rape.  
Rape is a form of violence involving the per-  
sonal humiliation of the victim. Whether  
the male supremacist commits the act in fact  
or fantasy, he participates in and perpet-  
uates the prowess myth of rape. The man who  
verbalizes, ""She makes me so mad I want to  
fuck her to death,"" is as guilty as the man  
who penetrates against a woman's will. In  
this category, I include husbands and lovers.  

Kinsey, Ruth Herschberger, and, more  
recently, Masters and Johnson, have challeng-  
ed the aforementioned sexual myths and misin-  
formation with reason and substantive clini-  
cal data. Nonetheless, the liberating po-  
tential of authentic sexual behavior cannot  
be realized as long as politics, i.e., domi-  
nance-subordinance behavior, characterize  
male-female relationships, as long as a  
male-dominated society insists on keeping  
women down. As Germaine Greer points out,  
for example:  

It is not...beyond the scope of...  
theorists to argue that all the women  
tested by Masters and Johnson were  
infantile products of improper condi-  
tioning, and that the fact that all  
orgasms in their samples were clitoral  
does not disprove that vaginal orgasms  
ever existed, could exist, or ought  

to exist....Facts are irrelevant to  
what is basically a value system.  

I believe the challenge to the sexual  
status quo must come from women. To ensure  
physical and psychic survival, we must  
demand new definitions of masculine and  
feminine that do not require dominance of  
one sex over the other, or better yet, do  
away with such antiquated notions completely.  
We, as women, must first get at the roots of  
our own oppression. As we develop self-  
determining, healthy self-concepts and sexual  
expectations, men will change in response.

As I begin the process of  
establishing residence in  
Minneapolis, I am struck by  
the potential power of my eco  
nomic decisions. I must find  
a dentist, a bank, a reliable  
auto mechanic, a veterinarian,  
etc. And women with estab-  
lished families have far more  
diverse needs than I have,  
and thus far more power. I  
believe we are now largely  
wasting this power.

Supporting Women

Personally, I would put up  
with some inconvenience to  
patronize a woman dentist,  
mechanic. I would boycott  
any local business which I  
knew practiced sexism, and I  
would walk to St. Paul, if  
necessary, to avoid placing  

my money with a financial  
institution which denied wom-  
en credit. Not only that,  

but I believe that my mother  
would also! That is, I sus-  
pect that a great many wom-  

en who do not feel committed  
to the Women's Movement, as  
such, would cooperate in a  
venture like this if the nec-  
essary information were read-  
ily available to them at the  
right time. The meat boycott  
showed the economic power that  
women can wield when they are  
angry enough and organized  
enough. The problem is mainly  
one of information. Which  
local taxicab services refuse  
to hire women drivers? Is  
there a local women's carpen-  
try group? Which financial  
agencies and which insurance  
companies are the worst?

What local businesses are  
owned by women?

A clearinghouse of such  
information, if widely pub-  
licized, could help fill this  
need. A Women's Grapevine co.  
could help Twin Cities women  
organize their potential eco-  
nomic power to help other wom-  
en who are struggling to est-  
ablish an economic base, and  
to boycott businesses that are  
hindering such efforts. It  
would act as a better business  
bureau for women. It could  
also function as a clearing-  
house for information about  
local services such as career  
counseling, day care, etc.  
and thus help women take ad-  
vantage of already existing  
services. Conveniently, much  
of this information has al-  
ready been researched by the  
staff of Changes.

Economic Grapevine:  
Women - Power

How can we gather the nec-  
essary information and how  
can we keep it current? I  
propose that someone or some  
dedicated group volunteer their  
telephone. Sympathetic  

sisters who are less comm-  
itted could chip in to pay  
the phone bill. Then, women  
with information or complaints  
or services to render should  
be solicited to call this  
number and share their inform-  
ation. The telephone number  
would have to be well publi-  
cized initially. There are  
several papers in the Twin  
Cities which might be very  
eager to provide the Women's  
Grapevine with some free pub-  
licity—Changes, for instance  
or perhaps ""The Minnesota  
Daily"". I suspect a little  
bit of brainstorming on our  
part could find a newsworthy  
""angle"" for the 'Tribune.'  
Certainly, every women's or-  
ganization in the Twin Cities  
should be called and informed  
of our telephone number. Some  
interesting bumper stickers  

could be printed up to adver-  
tise the Women's Grapevine.

Clearinghouse

All the information re-  
ceived would have to be ver-  
ified and filed. Once a fair  
amount of information was col-  
lected, other women could call  
the number and receive the  
information on file and be  
urged to verify it. After  
operation had begun, the na-  
ture of the questions re-  
ceived would help the Wom-  
en's Grapevine to define  
areas in which more inform-  
ation and services were need-  
ed. It might, for instance,  
spur the formation of a car-  
pentry collective, or help a  
struggling band survive. Or  
alter sexist hiring practices  
in a specific business.

A Women's Grapevine would  
be a helpful clearinghouse  
for information, but its use  
would probably still be lim-  
ited to the counter culture.  
A regular column in ""Gold  
Flower"" could be started to  
publicize what we knew and to  
encourage more women to vol-  
unteer information. The next  
step would be to publish a  
directory similar to the Black  
Yellow Pages which is publi-  
shed in Chicago as a direct-  
ory of Black businesses.

Mobilizing

The publishing of the Dir-  
ectory could be financed in  
part by approaching those in-  
dividuals and businesses which  
would be recommended by the  
directory. Hopefully, these  
people would be already app-  
reciative of the business  
sent to them by the Women's  
Grapevine and would be eager  
to advertise in such a dir-  
ectory. Thus it should be  
possible to distribute the  
directory for a nominal  
charge.

Our directory could be  
made available in bookstores  
and other women's groups could  
help with distribution. For  
instance, the U. of M. Women's  
Liberation could make sure the  
directory was available to all  
incoming students. And surely  
other imaginative means of  
effectively distributing the  
directory could be found.

Although most women who are  
reading this paper are comm-  
itted in principle to chang-  
ing the patriarchal structure  
of our society, our ability  
to attack it at its economic  
base is being limited by our  
lack of organization and in-  
formation. A Women's Grape-  
vine and a Women's Directory  
for the Twin Cities are rel-  
atively modest undertakings  
which could help us mobilize  
more of our resources to  
help our sisters, to pressure  
our oppressors, and to alter  
sexual power relationships.

The success of this project  
depends entirely on the real  
dedication of a large number  
of women. We need a phone.  

We need all the committed vol-  
unteers we can find. We need  
money. We need the active  
support of every woman who  

has experienced discrimination.

on sex or marital status.  

One is the public accommodations section which is 363.03 subdivision 3: ""It is an unfair discriminatory practice:  

To deny any person full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of race, color, creed, religion, national origin or sex.""  

In the view of the department of human rights, public accommodations includes any credit or loan granting.  

But there is a more specific provision which is in subdivision 7 of that same section and that plainly says: Credit Sex Discrimination: “It is an unfair discriminatory practice to discriminate in the extension of credit to a person because of sex.""  

So hopefully these two provisions will alleviate a lot of this real hardship. You know, the attitude of some credit grantors...I've even known of bank officials to say, ""I don't want my wife going around town running up charge accounts."" This was actually said by a bank official to a woman seeking to  

set up an independent checking account. Now this was an appalling statement for him to make.  

You must understand that these new provisions don't mean that every woman is going to be granted a charge account, credit card or a loan. She will be subject to the same criteria that a man is, but this is fine. Many times, in fact it's almost  

been universal, the criteria for extending credit has been different for men than for women. This is what the law intends to remedy. If a person is credit worthy under a certain set of circumstances, that is, has a certain job, a certain amount of assets, a bank account, home ownership, a car, then that person, whether the person be male or female, should be judged as a credit risk on an equal basis with all others in the same group.  

WHAT SHOULD A WOMAN DO IF SHE FEELS SHE'S BEEN UNFAIRLY DENIED CREDIT?  

Of course, being affiliated with the Department of Human Rights, I believe that the first thing she should do  

would be to contact our department with an accurate description of what has happened and file a charge of discrimination. Now you know discrimination on the basis of sex in credit has been banned prior to August 1 in the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Now, however, the state has the same provision. Our enforcement procedures  

in my opinion work a little more efficiently. I'm sure that if any of the representatives of the other departments read this they will challenge that. But it is  

my opinion that we do have a more protective investigation and complaint handling procedure so that we could get faster, equitable relief.  

Why I Didn’t Review Mailer  

When I was in high school, I often engaged in a characteristic fantasy of the oppressed. I imagined myself a famous writer, embarking on a long-awaited autobiography. One day I would stroll into the office of the assistant principal, who was the discipline officer, and ask for permission to tour the school. My reason, I would drawlingly explain, was that I was writing this autobiography, but unfortunately could not remember a thing about my years at his school. I hoped that a short walk about would spur my reluctant memory.  

I had the same kind of fantasy when I began reading  

The “Liberal”  

or  

“OK, So you’re getting screwed--you don’t have  

It happens every time. I meet a man who bears all the ""right"" signs--longish hair, faded jeans, McGovern sticker on his VW. His conversation puts me at ease (making yogurt at home, corporate waste, Nixon's latest incredible move) and before I know it, I find myself relaxed, opening up, trusting him.  

""My wife used to be in Women's Advocates.""  

""Oh, really?"" I ask excitedly.  

""Yes. A lot of those women were quite upset when she picked up with me."" Soon I find out why. ""Some of them would rather hate you than look at you,"" is the beginning of a long and increasingly insensitive succession of complaints about reverse discrimination. I am unprepared, my defenses down (I had trusted him), helpless. I manage, ""People can get bitter when they've been kicked around enough."" Both he and my liberal female (male-identified) friend miss the understatement. She speaks, not of the immeasurable destruction that women have suffered at the hands of men, but of the alienating effect of women's bitterness.  

Why is it that no self-respecting liberal would speak of how ""alienating"" black hatred of whites is, yet would seek to rob women of one means of regaining self-respect, righteous anger? My female friend fears anger, because she sees only its destructive potential, and because it's not “nice.” Men fear anger in women, because they fear that once women regain a healthy  

sense of themselves, they may no longer need men—and they are right.  

I, too, agree that an excess of bitterness can be destructive (though my concern is for the woman who feels the bitterness). But the way for men to deal with that bitterness is not to criticize (a very male reaction, and the way the bitterness started in the first place) but to understand and empathize. The feminist revolution is more than equal rights for women. It is a triumph of creative ""female"" values over destructive ""male"" values. And when our revolution is accomplished, I, a woman who trusts over and over and over again, will no longer have to listen to men lecture on female bitterness.

""Twenty women started this organization,  
Minnesota Feminists. Some were involved  
in the University Women's Liberation, and  
many of the women were disappointed with  
University Women's Liberation. There were  
the negative feelings of the group being a  
YSA (Young Socialist Alliance) front, a  
clique that was meeting the needs of only  
four or five women, the awareness groups  
were absent, the power was not organized  
and the group operated in a vacuum,” began  
Jackie Byrd, spokeswoman for Minnesota  
Feminists.  
“The organization was formed because a num-  
ber of members in University Women's Lib-  
eration felt that the organization had be-  
come unhealthy and needed changes. The  
organization had become unhealthy in our  
minds because we felt that the number of  
women's needs being met were almost nil.  
And it was really important to the women  
that were discussing the problems of the  
organization that more women's needs be met.  
""Some of the problems that we felt were  
happening were political ideologies were  
infringing on various women's rights. Fem-  
inism we felt should become the ideology.  
That women should come first and be the prim-  
ary focus. And the issues worked upon  
should be woman-oriented and we found in  
University Women's Liberation this wasn't  
happening and the changes were really nec-  
essary in order to make feminism the prime  
factor in a feminist organization.

A Positive Name

""First off we changed the name from Uni-  
versity Women's Liberation to Minnesota  
Feminists. Because we felt that University  
Women's Liberation was a name that had come  
from that past. And we are now moving for-  
ward in a positive direction. Which means  
that feminism is a positive name, a pro-  
active name, a name that is right now and  
that is very productive. Whereas women's  
liberation is a negative name. Liberation  
from something as opposed to feminism which  
is moving towards something. With a new  
name we could change the image and we could  
change a great many of the problems that had  
developed in University Women's Liberation.  
So out of the new name grew—one: a philos-  
ophy; two: a structure; and three: a pol-  
icy,"" continued Jackie.

""Feminism the pro-active versus the react-  
ive. We see ourselves as a pro-active, pro-  
women and positive directed organization.  
This is what we need to keep. And to do this  
we have to meet the needs of more than four  
or five women.

Feminist Philosophy  
""When we were discussing the change in  
the organization's direction we discussed  
philosophy a great deal. What we discovered  
was feminism is what each one of us lived  
day by day. It is integrated into our day-  
to-day behavior. Since it is integrated in-  
to our daily behavior, it also has to be  
integrated into the organization. It is done  
by implementing the things learned, the  
things we experience day by day, into the  
organization, which is very difficult. When  
we espouse feminism, it means we are willing  
to care about other women, to help other wo-  
men, not to stab other women in the back,

Pro-active Women—  
Minnesota Feminists Born

Diana Lynn Antolik

which is very hard not to do. But those  
ideas have to live in Minnesota Feminists.  
""If we say we want to meet all women's  
needs, if we say ‘I won't be around and I  
want to be active with women, I want to help  
women, and I want to share with women', it  
doesn't do to have an organization which ex-  
cludes women. Or excludes women that are  
different from us or doesn't think exactly  
the way I think or someone else thinks. Fem-  
inists are all going to be different types  
of women, from all different backgrounds and  
with different ideas. But the one thing we  
have in common is that we are all women, and  
we are all feminists. We can't close off  
other women.  
""It is also developing a way of looking at  
things from a totally feminist viewpoint.""

“The philosophy of the Minnesota Feminists  
is basically to admit the differences among  
women—race, class, sexual preference, pol-  
itical ideology (in the male sense) and to  
look beneath those differences to see that  
they are women and feminists and meet on  
that level.”

Unique Structure

""To have input that is total we have set  
up a unique organization,"" Jackie started  
explaining the structure of Minnesota Femin-  
ists. ""It involves the large group which  
is divided into awareness groups, specific  
task-oriented groups, ongoing groups and a  
steering committee.

""We had all read a number of articles and  
specifically 'The Tyranny of Structureless-  
ness' by Jo Freeman in MS (July 1973) and  
decided that one of the basic problems with  
University Women's Liberation was this tyr-  
anny of structurelessness. A few women gain-  
ed power in an organization because there  
wasn't any delineated power. This was frus-  
trating because no new women could get into  
the organization because of the clique. The  
older women with the group were not willing  
to teach other women. This produced a lot  
of hostility and dissonance within the group.  
That is why it was decided to give the org-  
anization a structure. To be as free as  
possible but also have worked out areas and  
lines of communication and teaching.

""The most important group is the awareness  
group (once called consciousness raising  
groups). They are a way of reaching new wom-  
en. It is very important to involve the  
personnel. It is also important for the sup-  
port of a woman involved in feminism for a  
long time or just starting out to continue  
the individual contact with other women.

“The task forces—women's studies,  
abortion, day care and others are task-orien-  
ted. (They can also serve as awareness group  
groups.) These task forces change, grow or  
end depending on what needs are to be met.  
These groups take action on various areas con-  
cerning women.

“Ongoing groups are the ones that are need-  
ed on a permanent basis. For example;  
running and staffing the office; a clearing  
house so there is contact with other women's  
organizations and will be information and  
knowledge flowing between them. The “Minn-  
esota Daily"" page for contact inter-univer-  
sity, a finance committee, a public relations  
group and more or less as needs arise that"
GoldFlower,2,5,August 1973,14,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No5_page014.txt,"Minnesota  
Feminists  

are continuing needs.  

""Each of these areas, groups, sends a  
representative chosen however they decide to  
represent them on the steering committee.  
Each of these women has a say and a vote in  
determining all policies. The steering comm-  
ittee also serves as a clearing house of  
inter-organization information. There will  
be knowledge passed so the abortion task  
force knows what other groups are doing and  

the reverse. This knowledge can then be  
taken back to the smaller groups and dis-  
persed.  

Stat”  

“Then taken from the MS article is a pos-  
ition of ""Star"". This position is for con-  
tact with the media since the media usually  
picks one vocal woman and makes her the spo-  
keswoman for the whole organization, whether  
or not she knows about the subject matter.  

So we created the position of Star. These  
three women have a responsibility to act as  
spokeswomen for the group. They meet with  
the press and other groups. These three wom-  
en have the group to be responsible to. The  
women are chosen by lottery and their names  
are submitted by the women themselves. There  
is an ego-gratification with this job but a  
lot of responsibility since they have to  
attend all steering committee meetings and

be a clearing house for information and the  
meetings will be more than business since  
programs are to be planned by either the task  
forces, ongoing groups or whoever would like.  

“We want to be both a university group

AND CURRENT ROLES OF INDIAN  
WOMEN.  

Enslavement  

I write this out of love--  
for my Indian brothers and  
sisters, to help you under-  
stand our history and not be  
ashamed that our women, as  
well as our men, are strong  
people.  

Our Indian men are enslaved  
by powerful white men, whose  
power filters down through  
the bureaucracy and reaches  
them in the form of the BIA,  
schools, churches, employ-  

ment agencies and other insti-  

tutions. They in turn try to  
enslave us, the nearest tar-  
get for their rage.  

Our men believe they are  
""demasculinized"" by the white  
men, who took away all means  
of earning a living (hunt-  
ing, fishing and so forth)  
and tried to make them over  
in their image, i.e.:  

THE MAN must go out into  
the world to earn a living;  
he divorces himself from his  
emotions, home and children;  
he must work 8-5 every day  
instead of working several  
days then resting and cele-  
brating for several days.  

THE WOMAN bears her children

legs tied down, with no

friends or relatives to help  
her; she raises and teaches  
her children; she sews, cooks  
and cleans.  

THE YOUNG PEOPLE must stay  
clean, quiet, obedient; they  
must learn in school from 9-  
3, instead of from life all  
the time.  

THE OLD PEOPLE must live  
separately, waiting to die,  
instead of teaching young  
ones and practicing medicine.  

Indian children in white  
schools have been punished  
for speaking their own lan-  
guage or practicing their  
own religion or culture. Kept  
from learning their true his-  
tory, they were told only  
that they were savage, drunk,  
lazy, heathen at best.  

Turnabout  

were taught that the  
Indian community--Hol-  
lywood version--meant a  
strong ""buck,"" lord and mas-  
ter over his ""squaw,"" a  
brainless drudge who does all  
the work, waits on him,  
praises him and lives for him.  

This western interpretation  
is decidedly not true!  

For example, take the case  
of Sacajawea--the only per-  
son with the knowledge and  
courage to guide the explor-  
ers Lewis and Clark. There is  
a reason for her self-reli-  
ance and independence--a long-  
time tradition.  

Indian women were accustom-  
ed to responsibility. They  
built the tribe's homes, each  
especially designed for its lo-  
cale, climate and uses--  
pueblos which rival today's  
skyscrapers, teepees which  
are insulated for summer and  
winter, hogans, long houses.  

They also made the policy

of the tribe,  

in the Grand  
Council of Women; they de-  
cided when they should plant,  
according to the moon and  
natural signs. They deter-  
mined when to hunt or move  

to a new location.  

The Medicine Women doctored  
with herbs, teas and other  
medicines--many of which,  
such as quinine and witch  
hazel, were copied and claim-  
ed as original by modern med-  
icine. Family planning was  
practiced, mostly by absten-  
sion from sex, but in some  
cases a strong tea was drunk  
to abort an unwanted fetus.  
The technique of the IUD was  
practiced by placing small  
stones in the womb, which  
prevented the fetus from at-  
taching and growing.  

In the old times, women  
were physically, mentally  
and spiritually attuned.  

They knew that the impor-  
tant matters of the tribe  
rested on their shoulders,  
and that their bodies were  
capable of the most difficult  
work. They were dignified and  
dressed plainly; each woman  
was her own person, knowing  
herself, her capabilities,  
her humor and her judgment.  

The men, on the other hand,  
loved children; they were  
sensitive to nature, art and  
others' feelings.  

Survival  

Indian women were on an  
equal plane; the women still  
have a reputation for being  
able to take care of them-  
selves. Just trying to sur-  
vive as a woman is difficult  
--but it has been, and is,  
especially difficult for  
the Indian woman.

by Pat Monaghan

Down the alley behind the  
Duluth YWCA, there is a small  
building—no more seedy-look-  
ing than most in that time-  
worn neighborhood—with a  
barn-red door.

Inside, stairs lead to an  
airy office and lounge. The  
freshly-painted walls are  
still bare; a desk, several  
chairs and a few bookshelves  
are scattered across the  
wooden floor. The high win-  
dows look over grey downtown  
Duluth to the historic aerial  
bridge.

Because Duluth is a city  
where I spent some important  
years, and because I still  
have a sore spot in my heart  
for that unfashionable old  
city, my curiosity had been  
piqued when a friend (dis-  
dainfully noting that she  
""didn't need that sort of  
stuff"") told me that Duluth  
had a struggling women's cen-  
ter. So on my next northern  
visit I located the center  
and its coordinator, Kay  
Slick.

She began apologetically,  
explaining that things had  
""just been a mudpie"" all sum-  
mer, and that the center was  
just beginning its fall pro-  
gramming. At her office in  
a corner of the center's  
front room—the rest is work-  
space and a rudimentary li-  
brary—Kay described the  
center's history and plans  
for the public opening next  
month.

It has been nearly two  
years since Duluth women  
first recognized a need for  
a women's center, Kay related.  
The idea was tossed around by  
local women’s groups and  

concerned individuals; a  
successful women's confer-  
ence last year gave added  
impetus to the proposal.  
Then, last year, activist  
Kris Nelson began organi-  
zing the center through EPI  
EPIC (Educational Project  
Involving Consumers), a fed-  
erally-funded program oper-  
ating out of the Duluth med-  
ical school. When Kris left  
EPIC, Kay took over the po-  
sition and continued agita-  
ting for a center.

Last spring the YWCA of-  
fered use of the roomy but  
run-down Decker Building on  
a rent-free basis for a year,  
with rent to be negotiated  
thereafter. The building  
seemed too big for the pro-  
posed center, but another  
group volunteered to use the  
downstairs for a day-care  
center, and the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center became a tan-  
gible reality.

Repairs—originally esti-  
mated at nearly $1600 for  
materials and labor—were  
executed at enormous saving  
by Duluth women who sanded  
floors, painted and other-  
wise assisted the renovation  
effort. Since that flurry  
of activity, however, the  
center has been struggling.

""I wouldn't say there's a  
high feminist consciousness  
in Duluth,"" said Kay Slick  
wearily. ""There's a need for  
advocacy, a need for rape  
counseling, a need for var-  
ious referrals. But there's  

nothing here yet that women  
can identify with as a wo-  
man's thing.""

Kay sees the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center as offering “an  
alternative to women who  
see themselves as being  
locked in"" to traditional  
female roles, but admitted  
""it's hard to reach those  
women—they're still afraid  
to come here.""

To Kay, part of the prob-  
lem in generating support is  
""the exceptional woman thing.  
I know a lot of women who are  
personally strong, but they  
don't see themselves as need-  
ing the center."" Nonetheless  
she feels that “the city does  
need a women's center. We  
just don't know who the wo-  
men are that need us, or wh  
where they are.""

Projects begun by the cen-  
ter, in addition to con-  
sciousness-raising sessions  
and related groups, include a  
weekly radio program, a dance  
class, and an ad hoc referral  
service for lawyers and doc-  
tors.

Kay described abortion  
counseling as ""shallow,  
fragmented and underground”  
in Duluth, pointing out that  
only one abortion had been  
performed there since the Su-

preme Court ruling last win-

abortions in the Twin Cities  
area; younger women have dif-  
ficulty finding birth con-  
trol services as well.

Kay Slick feels isolated,  
""bleak but not really dis-  
couraged,"" she explained.  
""Women here still see the  
women's movement as being  
external to their lives. Right  
now we're still really into a  
self thing, heavy self-exam-  
ination, thinking about how  
being a woman is affecting  
our lives. But we need the  
women's center, even if its  
function is confined entirely  
to offering personal support.""

Two Letters Respond to  
Minnesota Feminist Article

IDEALS OF FEMINISM DIE

Dear Sisters:

I read with interest the article ""Pro-active  
Women--Minnesota Feminists Born"" in the  
August issue. As an active member of Minn-  
esota Feminists (formerly University of  
Minnesota Women's Liberation) who is also  

in the Young Socialist Alliance, I feel I  
must counter certain biases presented.

The spokesperson for Minnesota Feminists  
stated Minnesota Feminists was formed be-  
cause ""there were the negative feelings of  
the group (Women's Liberation) being a YSA  
front, a clique that was meeting the needs  
of only four or five women."" There were  
several allegations in the article that Wom-  
en's Liberation was not responsive to the  
needs of women. A brief review of last  
year's activities is needed:

University of Minnesota Women's Libera-  
tion won the fight with the University  
Health Service, winning pap smears and preg-  
nancy tests at no extra charge, abortion re-  
ferrals and counseling, an ombudsperson, and  
in-service staff training to make health  
service employees more sensitive to women  
and the need to treat us in a non-sexist,  
non-patronizing manner.

We continued our work with women's stud-  
ies--an idea that originated in our group  
and grew into the existing women's studies  
program.

We picketed two public hospitals which  
refused to give women abortions.

We sent speakers to high schools, college  
classrooms and community groups.

We sponsored ""The New Feminism Conference:  
Cultural, Political and Educational Impli-  
cations"", which involved almost 30 pro-fem-  
ale groups in the city--10 of which directly  
participated in planning meetings, along  
with individuals from high schools and the  
community. Over 300 people attended the  
conference.

We sponsored a women's fair and film fes-  
tival with over 100 people attending.

We presented various educationals through-  
out the year.

Now, just whose needs were not being met?  
Certainly, Women's Liberation was responsive  
to the needs of campus and community women  
by leading struggles for better health care,  
better education and abortion rights.

To say ""the number of women's needs being  
met were almost nil"" implies a serious dis-  
agreement on what the needs of women are.  
The ""needs"" of women can only  
be interpreted, in light of the article, to  
mean the individual needs of women in deal-  

ing with personal problems that arise from  
living in a sexist society. Individual  
needs are important--no one wishes to deny  
that. Women's Liberation has always made  
attempts to include consciousness-raising in  
the organization--some were successful, oth-  
ers were not.

C-R and self-awareness groups are important  
factors in developing an understanding of  
our oppression, but they must not become  
isolated from activity--activity which also  
leads one's consciousness to higher levels.  
No woman, no matter how high her conscious-  
ness, or how deep her self-awareness, is  
free in a sexist society. Society's insti-  
tutions, be they religious, judicial, legis-  
lative, educational, medical or commercial,  
discriminate against women and promote the  
myth of our inferiority. To attack women  
(such as women in the YSA) who focus most  
of their energy on the broad, societal iss-  
ues that face us, is to lack perspective of  
the scope of the feminist struggle. Our  
fight goes beyond the level of individual  
solutions of coping in a sexist society: A  
tremendous amount of power must be generated  
to make society meet the needs of over one-  
half of its members.

This is the basic issue of disagreement:

How do we best build the women's movement?  
Is it by C-R and self-awareness groups or by  
organizing women around the issues that aff-  
ect our lives. Certainly, women who support  
the former are sincere in their beliefs, but  
I believe history will prove the latter stra-  
tegy correct--as it has in other struggles  
of the oppressed, such as the suffragist move  
ment.

It is absurd to think that women who want to  
build a powerful women's movement would dis-  
courage anyone who is interested in belong-  
ing to a feminist organization and anyone  
who wants to develop organizational skills--  
skills that are vital in building a movement.  
Every woman is desperately needed to be a  
leader.

Anyone who has taken on organizational re-  
sponsibility will understand problems org-  
anizers have: getting people to share re-  
sponsibility, to follow through with their  
commitments and to actively participate in  
the boring day-to-day survival responsibil-  
ities. People who have had such experiences  
will recognize the fallacy in the argument  
that organizers won't reach out to new  
people and won't teach new people skills--  
be they making leaflets or spending evenings  
on the phone raising money to writing press  
releases and holding news conferences. I  
was not born with any of these skills. I  
learned them from ""older"" members in Women's  
Liberation who were eager to develop new,

young leaders. Sharing organizational skills
and responsibilities is a two-way process—
people must want to learn. That desire
comes from a very real sense of the magni-
tude of the feminist struggle and the will-
ingness to dedicate much of one's time and
energy to tedious chores. That, in essence,
is the key to leadership. People who do not
fully understand the pressures and intrica-
cies of organizational work (because they
have not been in that position) obviously
cannot appreciate the perspective of active
organizers. The only way for them to learn
is to get their hands dirty with the chores
of responsibility—not just talk about ideas.
Implementation is the only standard by which
to judge the correctness of ideas and cor-
rectness makes for respected leadership.

Minnesota Feminists has inherited a fine
history of activism from Women's Liberation.
Strength and the ability to work effectively
around the issues that affect campus and
community women come from unity, not from
divisiveness on personal and political diff-
erences. My feelings at this point are ones
of extreme sadness. The feelings of many
women have been hurt. Some are YSA or Soci-
alist Workers Party members; others are wom-
en who also have been excluded from two
months of Minnesota Feminist meetings be-
cause they were considered to be too close
to members of the YSA on either a personal
or political level. That is not my defini-
tion of sisterhood. I think it's time this
divisiveness stops. We must concentrate our
efforts and energies on our real enemies,
not on each other.

Sincerely,

IDEALS OF FEMINISM DIE

I am not and have never been a member of
the Socialist Workers Party. Nonetheless,
I was lumped with the arbitrarily chosen
scapegoats, boxed in, and shoved out. I am
the victim of a purge of University of Minn-
esota Women's Liberation. My hopes about
sisterhood and the moral superiority of wom-
en have flown out the window. One whom I
once saw as a beloved sister, I now see as a
tragic power tripper.

The organization now called Minnesota Fem-
inists was not started this summer by twenty
dissatisfied women, as Jackie Byrd alleges.
It was started in 1971 during the student
strikes, under the name of University of
Minnesota Women's Liberation. Its purpose
was to meet and discuss the special needs of
women, which were not being met by the male-
dominated New Left, which Robin Morgan ref-
ers to as ""The Boy's Movement."" The organ-
ization has been extremely active and has
maintained its radical feminist line during
apathetic and hellsapoppin' political times.

One cannot accurately claim we met the
needs of only four or five women; or the
Socialist party. We have sponsored speak-
outs on rape, abortion, and day care. In the
1972-1973 school year we held campaigns for
legal abortion and exposed some of the
incompetent and dehumanizing gynecological
care women were getting at the University
health service. We demanded and got, with
the help of hundreds of righteously angry
women, pap smears at no additional charge,
pregnancy tests at no additional charge, and
an end to moral harassment at the hands of

certain gynecologists in the employ of the
University. In the same year, we sponsored,
with MWAAC, a conference and march for legal
abortion, both of which were attended by
several hundred people.

This past year our area of concentration
has been Women's Studies. Another victim of
exclusion, also not a socialist, developed
the idea for a course called ""Feminism and
American Intellectual Life."" The course
reached large numbers of women both in the
classroom and at the public lectures. One of
the seven speakers at the lectures was Robin
Morgan. Women's Liberation obtained a
Women's Studies Program at the University of
Minnesota, and we are determined to remain
available to agitate for more classes.

Women's Liberation has organized CR
groups and Women's Coalitions to lead anti-
war marches. Individually, we have been
involved in lobbying and letter writing cam-
paigns for the ERA, abortion, and we have
been involved in the political campaigns of
candidates from the Democrat and Socialist
parties. This spring we sponsored a confer-
ence featuring the great Flo Kennedy. (Who,
by the way, told us, ""If you want to kick ass,
you've got to learn to aim high."" She warned
us about ""horizontal hostility,"" that is,
hostility toward one's equally oppressed
peers.) We also put on a Women's Fair and
Film Festival, providing an outlet to many
local female artists.

The activities we have sponsored have been
well attended and have turned thousands of
women on to the beauty of sisterhood. I
hope I have adequately illustrated that the
organization is not being run in the in-
terests of a few witches on red broomsticks
or some potentate in the Kremlin.

If things continue the way they have, the
organization may now be run in the interests
of one. It is amusing to the point of apop-
lexia to have Jackie declare, all innocent
of irony, ""It doesn't do to have an organi-
zation that excludes women that are
different from us or doesn't think exactly
the way I think or someone else thinks.""

Jackie Byrd met secretly all summer with
twenty women loosely connected with, but not
active in, Women's Liberation. The struct-
ural changes developed in these clandestine
meetings were not really changes, as I shall
illustrate. What was new was the undemo-
cratic way they were accomplished. Formerly
there had been a constant struggle to keep
the group non-exclusive. Not surprisingly,
some of the staunchest defenders of the
policy of non-exclusion were socialists.

With one exception, none of the ideas they
came up with were original. Task forces had
functioned most effectively on the issues of
the Health Service, Day Care, and Women's
Studies. As I already stated, Women's Lib-
eration was in favor of consciousness
raising groups and has sponsored them in the
past. We unfailingly held steering commit-
tee meetings to set policy and make the
agenda for meetings. The difference is that
then anyone who wanted to was encouraged to
attend. Now only elected CR 'representa-
tives' may attend! The one change which I
will remain opposed to is the institution
of ""Star.""

That these two women gained
fame through not seeking it
directly is appropriate as
well, for those born under
this sign are uncomfortable
with direct self-assertion.
Born under the zodiac's
sixth sign, the cautious and
hesitating Virgo woman is
further encouraged by social
conditioning to subject her-
self to others. The Virgo-
born are perfectionists who
seek order in their surroun-
dings; for the Virgo woman,
this often takes the form
of fanatic housecleaning and
slavish devotion to her fam-
ily. Society encourages the
Virgo woman to perform this
role; because it fills some
of her own needs, she
accepts it.

Q,

Virgo woman is encouraged to
develop her most negative
qualities: to sublimate her
passions, to dedicate her-
self wholly to others, to
modestly aid her ""superiors""
without aiming at advance-
ment. This kind of Virgo
woman makes the perfect
secretary, nurse or house-
wife; she is neat, orderly,
restrained and unassuming.
She is also vaguely dis-
content, although not often
able to articulate her com-
plaints.

Looking over the impres-
sive list of Virgo women who,
while not household words,
established themselves as
leaders in their field, we
find that--like Sanger and
Addams--they chose fields
which fulfilled their need to
serve while not restricting
them to the file cabinet or
dust mop. There's Margaret
Anderson Watts, who founded a
home for indigent women; ed-
ucator Celestia Susannah Par-
rish; kindergarten organizer
Margarethe Meyer Schwez;
children's writer Rachel
Lyman Field; Sophia Smith,
founder of Smith College. An
impressive list, and one
which suggests that the Virgo
need not restrict herself to

by arcotts

servility, that the rendering
of service need not be done
at the expense of self-res-
pect.

The Virgo woman's sexuali-
ty is strong, though in our
restrictive society it is
often unexpressed or inhibi-
ted. An earth sign, Virgo's
reputed ""barrenness"" is that
of fields after harvest;
hers is a full and settled
sexuality that can lie dor-
mant until the proper con-
ditions present themselves.
Fastidious and sensitive
to nuance, the Virgo woman
can be discouraged by care-
less love-making; her sur-
prisingly strong sex drive
can then be sublimated into
an exaggeration of her Virgo
traits, producing a neuroti-
cally puritanical attitude.
In a society which encourages
her to develop her least
affirmative qualities, the
Virgo woman faces a challenge
indeed.

Other women born under
Virgo include ""Grandma"" Mo-
ses, Anna Ella Carroll, Irene
Lewisohn, Alice Stone Black-
well, Caroline Hamilton Pier,
Dame Edith Sitwell, Hilda
Doolittle (HD) and Mary God-
win Shelley.

talking to one strong woman in the group and
calling her 'president', etc. The idea
seems to have lost some humor in the transi-
tion. There were to be three stars, who
were picked by lottery, and they were to
have no vote as to the policy they represent.
Amazingly enough, the only person who cared
to be the star was none other than Ms. Byrd.
She has violated the spirit in which Minne-
sota Feminists accepted the idea, and
furthermore has been out of town for a week
at a time when the press wished to reach
her. We may as well be calling her Madame
President. Because the whole idea is oppos-
ed to the democratic ideals of feminism, and
because its power has been abused from its
inception, I am opposed to it.

We have all learned many lessons from
this power grab. Partly that the Women's
movement is not immune to cheap political
shenanigans, and that victims tend to come
from a time-honored list of outgroups: pick
your own scapegoat. We must continue to
struggle to keep the women's movement non-
exclusive, because too many of us are poten-
tial victims of exclusiveness. The big
lesson I have been forced to accept from my
formerly beloved sister, is that a woman's
politics have nothing to do with her inte-
grity.

There's going to be a ""cooperative"" con-
ference on Sept. 28-30 in Mpls. People from:
all over will be there and who knows what
will happen. Most of the workshops will be
planned when everyone gets to the People's
Center, 20th and Riverside, on Fri. night.

I work at a food coop and the only reason
I'm planning to go is because some women
will be organizing, probably around noon Sat
(place to be arranged). We are hoping that
we can meet each other and share our experi-
ences as women working in coops.

There are lots of women doing lots of hard
work in the coops. There are lots who used
to work in coops. And there are women who
have intentionally stayed away from coop
involvement. From what I know, even though
many women want to work cooperatively, the
coops are still traditionally sexist and may
keep many women away. I find this showing
up especially in the way people at our coop
talk to each other at meetings.

Although there is a lot more that I could
say, as a feminist, about my own coop exper-
iences, I would rather not write about it by
myself. I would like to talk more to other
women and then write collectively. It would
be exciting if through the conference we
could get together a group of women from
every coop to analyze sexism in coops and
what we can do about it. Maybe we could
then write a thing for ""Gold Flower.""

For information about places and times call
any of the coops listed in this issue. The
conference is open to anyone and gay care
is provided.

Only six men and many more women came to
the performance of “Lysistrata"" which I saw
at Dudley Riggs' Experimental Theater Co.
on Washington Ave. A pity for both sexes.
More men should have come to enjoy the fami-
liar male buffoonery which clutters our mo-
dern stage. The women should have skipped
this chance to see a mythical heroine in
action, and rather stayed home that evening
to watch a very real Billie Jean King dis-
patch another Riggs.

For those few readers who are curious
about what ""Lysistrata"" is like as a man's
play, I'll recite the transformation. The
men are introduced as crippled, yet still
operative wind-up soldiers in an extended
scene which opens this adaptation. (In
Aristophanes' ""Lysistrata,"" the opening
scene belongs to the women.) When the women
are finally brought on in this misbegotten
production, Lysistrata talks like a carni-
val barker, a female Professor Harold Hill.
The rest of the women are twittering cheer-
leaders. Remember, I recite; I don't ex-
plain.

The women agree to deprive the men of
the sexual access until the men settle on
a peaceful compromise. Lysistrata incites
her unlikely troops to storm the Acropolis.
They throw the men out and the separation
begins.

The rest of the performance concentrates
on the men's sexual agonies as they attempt
to wrest their women from the seat of power
and hustle them back to hearth and home.

A sausage-shaped pink balloon is used as a
battering ram and returns limp from the
fray. The men clutch their crotches, wail
out their desires, and beg for a normal life
in which women and war are compatible plea-
sures.

This clowning was intermittently funny,
but these laughs should not have belonged to
the men. It is the women who recognize
their husbands and protectors as comedians.
The comedy is sharpest when the women dis-
parage their men's military pretensions.

Library Positions

The American Library Asso-

on Women maintains a roster
of women interested in admin-
istrative management and
specialist positions in lib-
raries.

Women who desire to
be placed on the roster fill
out a standard form, which
includes such basic resume
information as educational
and employment background,
type of library and responsi-
bilities preferred, geograph-
ic restrictions. On the
basis of this information pro-
file forms are screened and
matched to incoming employer
requests for resumes.

The goal of the women's
roster is to increase the
opportunities for women in
librarianship at a time when
fewer women are being chosen
for high level positions than
was the case twenty years
ago. Currently, 73 women are
listed on the roster and over
100 library employers have re-
quested resumes either for
general affirmative action
use or for specific job open-
ings. The roster has been in
operation since spring, 1972.

A Review

Referring to Rogers' translation of the
Greek comedy, I find the lines:

LYSISTRATA. Now in the market you see them
like Corybants, jangling about with
their armor of mail.

Fiercely they stalk in the midst of the
crockery, sternly parade by the cabbage
and kale...

STRATYLLIS. Lately I witnessed a captain
of cavalry, proudly the while on his
charger he sat,

Witnessed him, soldierly, buying an omelet
stowing it all in his cavalry hat...

Off runs a shop-girl, appalled at the
sight of him, down he sits soldierly,
gobbles her fruit.

The women in the Experimental Theater Co.
production have no lines like that. They
are continually and deliberately upstaged
by the men. Lysistrata is nearly a minor
character. I can only suppose that the
director, James Monitor, slanted the pro-
duction toward the only kind of humor and
heroics he understands. ""Lysistrata"" is
simply not his play, and once he got his
hands on it, it could not be ours either.

By the play's end, the antiwar humor has
been drowned out by a deluge of sexuality.
The men are ""hot"" and a painted sun glowers
down on them. What do they do on this
sweltering day? They eat donuts -- linger-
ingly, lovingly. No doubt every hole is
supposed to be a vagina, but as I watched
one soldier shove his staff through this
tight little pastry, the resemblance to an
asshole was unmistakable. Monitor's over-
zealous attempts to emphasize a heterosex-
ual tension sometimes take strange turns.

""Lysistrata"" ends, of course, with peace
and a nominal victory for the women. But
it's the men, always the men, who are
smiling."

readings this fall. One, to be held in  
mid-October, will feature poets Jenne  
Andrews, Patricia Hampl, and Carolyn Vo-

poetry concerning women's fears of, and  
reactions to, the crime of rape; the  
reading is a benefit for a member of the  
organization who was attacked and beaten  
this summer. Dates and places of the  
readings have not yet been announced.

Jenne Andrews, whose book ""In Pursuit  
of the Family"" will be published soon,  
grew up in New Mexico and studied  
creative writing at Colorado State. Dur-  

ing her two years in Minnesota, her work  
has been published in Ms. and many poetry

if drunken, roller skate dance.  

However, outsiders rarely can perceive the  
private beauty of these leavetakings and of-  
ten grow restive, embarrassed and, sadly,  
bored.  

After the ""Montage,"" however, the play loses  
its vitality. Ms. Havoc's characters suffer  
human weaknesses and are victims of cosmic  
cruelties. But the author does not engage  
the audience's sympathies.  

Such is the case with June Havoc's farewell  
to vaudeville, ""I, Said the Fly,"" which had  
its world premiere September 20 at the Guth-  
rie Theater.  

Alma Marvel is pregnant and can't stop  
taking dangerous pratfalls because her hus-

tutes Ms. Havoc's remembrance of her life  

in vaudeville, which began when she was two-  
year-old ""Baby June"" and continued through  
her incarnation as ""Miss Dainty June, the  
tiniest toe dancer in the world.""  

Fanny Brad agonizes over Bunty's increasing  
dependence on the bottle.  

But I could perceive these dilemmas only at  
one remove—as though the author had anes-  
thetized her characters' pain.  

Vaudevillians and Geeks  

In ""I, Said the Fly,"" Ms. Havoc presents the  
plight of a company of shopworn vaudevill-  

ians—Fanny and Bunty Brads, Big Gurn, Harry  
and Alma Marvel ""And Company.""  

Only Kenneth Welsh reached me in his por-  
trayal of Big Gurn, a second-rate performer  
who sadistically brutalizes ""And Company,""  
the untalented young woman who assists him  
with the rats and guinea pigs who co-star  
with Big Gurn.  

The group is stranded in a mid-western tank  
town, struggling to avoid the fate of ""geek  
acts"" (performances in which animals are tor-  
tured and killed for the audience's edifica-  
tion).  

Welsh is repellant and convincing when he  
taunts ""And Company"" with her inability to  
commit suicide.  

Moths and Acrobats  

The group receives notifications from their  
agents that booking offices are closing:  
vaudeville is dead.  

The author mixes the dreamy, rather abstract  
quality of the ""Montage"" with the melo-  
dramatic ""realism"" of the second act.  

The finest moments in the production come at  
the beginning. A ""Montage"" of vaudevillians  
parades before the audience before the story  
begins.  

From time to time, silent tumblers and  
acrobats appear and mime a routine while  
the play's action goes forward. These  
attempts at surreal symbolism fail, as does  
the introduction of a moth-like figure in  
pink gauze who wafts across the stage dur-  
ing scene changes.  

Meet the Family  

The audience meets Bunty Brads and Family  
(Ms. Havoc plays Fanny Brads). In this re-  
creation of an old vaudeville routine, Ms.  
Havoc gives the audience the most fulfilling  
moments of the evening. Although she is  
well into middle age, she retains an econom-  
ical dancer's body and the confidence that  
must come from performing since infancy.  

Although ""I, Said the Fly"" is only as good  
as the ""Montage"" which opens it, the appear-  
ance of June Havoc is impressive.  

Seeing this talented, widely experienced  
woman was justification for my evening. I  
hope her next play is worthy of her.  

The ""Montage"" has a cinematic, ""Felliniesque""  
quality. And, Barbara Byrne intensifies  

this mood as Alma Marvel, a sweet clown in  
baggy pants—very reminiscent of Giulietta  
Massini.  

Performances of ""I, Said the Fly"" continue  
with matinees and evening performances  
through September, October and November.

by KATE LIGARE

""I mean, do you know any-
thing about your car?
Beyond how to start it?""

--St. Paul administrator
to ""Gold Flower"" reporter

KKK KKK KK kkk

The fall I turned sixteen, my
father took me out to the gar
age and made me change a tire
on the family station wagon.
If I was going to drive, I had
to be able to take care of
the simple emergencies. The
fall I turned 22, I bought my
first car and my father and

I spent another session in
the garage reviewing jumper
cables, carburetors, spark
plugs, and heater hoses.
Which was not much in terms
of the infinite number of
things that can go wrong with
a car, but it was more than
most men and women know about
the vehicle they depend upon
so heavily.

Peculiarities

It always seemed peculiar to
me that in a school system
which taught me how to brush
my teeth, use a compound mi-
croscope, and shoot a bow
and arrow I was never taught
how to do something as sim-
ple and essential as change a
tire on a car. But then,
neither was my brother. Auto
repair and maintenance essen-
tially remains a mystery to
us both.

Male Fantasies

That's why most Auto Mechan-
ics classes in the Twin

Cities area assume at the be-
ginning that students don't
know anything about cars ""and
most of them don't."" And,
according to South Community
School Director Gary Soule,
automobile classes designed
specifically for women oper-
ate on an assumption that is
totally erroneous. ""The idea
that boys start in Auto Mech-
anics with more background
than girls is just not true
as far as we're concerned.""
Apparently, men just bring

in a few more pet fantasies;
fantasies which are quickly
dispelled once work on cars
really begins.

Courses in the Twin Cities
to help people better under-
stand their automobiles range
from elementary classroom in-
troductions to full scale
work on a variety of engines
and specialized problems.
Offered at a reasonable cost
in well-equipped facilities,
such night courses are popu-

lar among both sexes and
appear well-organized and re-
sponsibly taught.

The interest and ability of
women to work on cars is
accepted, respected, and
highly encouraged at most
community schools. Although
some schools like South teach
all coeducational courses,
other schools offer a few
courses exclusively for wo-
men to encourage them to en-
roll. And although no wo-
man has ever been used as an
instructor, Stan Baraga, Dir-
ector of the Minneapolis Adult
Education Program, states
emphatically that ""if we had
a good female mechanic, we'd
use her for sure.""

Top People

In general, ""women are sur-
prised by what they can end
up doing,"" reports David
Barkmeier, Auto Maintenance
Instructor at South High.
According to Barkmeier, women
tend to take the course more
seriously and are therefore
more meticulous and successful
in their work.

""Three women were my top
people in last year's Auto
Maintenance class. Between
them, they tuned up eight
cars--they brought in the
cars of neighbors, friends,
everybody.""

Fun Tune-Ups

Barkmeier tries to not only
teach the basics of Auto
Maintenance in his course, but
give students a feeling for
reasonable repair charges and
suggestions for cutting costs.

Nancy Moody, one of Bark-
meier's star pupils, was also
glowing in her description of
the course.

""My girlfriend and I de-
cided to take the course be-
cause it was so expensive to
have the car fixed all the
time. My husband did a lot
of our car work and had some
of the tools, but I was tired
of just helping him. I wanted
to get beyond just tagging a-
long.""

""It was really fun. We got
into doing tune-ups, install-
ing new shock absorbers, and
packing wheel bearings. I
learned some things that my
husband didn't know and we got
good advice on tools and eq-
uipment to invest in.""

""There were 15 people in the
course and maybe half were
women. Some girls tended to
play down their ability and"
GoldFlower,2,6,,14,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No6_page014.txt,"Auto Mechanic, cont.

ask guys for help; other wo-
men wanted to do it on their
own and resented help. On
the whole, though, women
seemed more patient and thor-
ough!

""I guess the best thing I got
from the course was the confi-
dence that if something went
wrong with my car, I was not
at the mercy of someone else.
Even if I don't want to do
the work myself, I know what
is involved and what to ex-
pect from a garage.""

Instructor Barkmeier echoes
Nancy Moody's thoughts. ""Most
of the women we get really
want to learn how to do it
themselves. They don't want
to rely on husbands or boy-
friends and they don't want
to be taken in by filling
stations and ripped off every
time they have to take their
cars into a garage.""

95% Curious

Girls are also enrolling in
high school Auto Mechanics
courses during the day. As I
talked with Barkmeier and a-
nother instructor at South
High, three girls in the back-
ground were taking a test on
ignition systems, along with
fifteen high school boys.

""I suppose 95% of the girls I
get here during the day are
just curious,"" stated Bark-
meier. ""They think it's a fun
class to take. But at the
end of the course, I'll make

recommendations to anyone who
I think has the capability to
become a good mechanic."" So
far, he hasn't run across a
woman with such aspirations,
but he feels there have been
a few who had the ability.

Options, Options

Another option open to Twin
Cities residents who wish to
work on their own cars are
do-it-yourself garages.
Community Garage, 344 East 19th
St. (335-0663) is a
loose club-school organization
of about 150 people, almost
50% of whom are women. For
$10 a year, members are free
to use garage space and equip-
ment and enlist the services
of their personal mechanic.
Do-It-Yourself Auto-Repair at
701 West Excelsior Blvd. also
offers garage space and tools
on an hourly rental basis. A
mechanic consultant is avail-
able, as well as the service
of analyzing a potential used
car for a buyer.

Despite the fact that I still
wouldn't know what to do if
smoke started billowing out of
my engine on Highway 94 during
rush hour, it is comforting
to know that in terms of opp-
ortunities, Twin Cities real-
ity is far more encouraging
than the myth.

A Funeral

It was the first funeral I had ever been
to in my life. People I have known have
died before, but no one this close, and so
I took a day off work to go to her funeral
and to try and work into my system the fact
of her death. She was only 33. The thing
about death is, you can't take it piece by
piece and absorb it gradually. It has to

be swallowed whole. I have never seen a
dead person before either, so the shock of
the open casket was hard for me. I hadn't

really cried about her death yet, but when
the man in a grey suit carefully closed the
lid over her face, I did cry... And as I
looked around I saw many old friends, men
and women, crying. The whole service was
full of moments like the closing of the cas-
ket -- triggering off sobs or muffled weep-
ing. The principal of my old school spoke
for the majority of the time, and he calmly
recalled events, characteristics, jokes
about her life in the school and in the
world. And there were moments during the
service when we laughed, too. Maybe this
was one of the finest tributes to Barbara --
we couldn't think about her without smiles
because she brought so much humor into our
lives.

When I think back on the funeral and the
hours I spent afterwards in the Junior High
where I had taught the year before, I am
struck by a new warmth and tenderness in the
experience which never existed so strongly
and openly before with those same people.
And when I narrow it down even further; I
think it had to do with the fact that men
cried openly, touched more and expressed

all ranges of emotion without self-conscious-
ness. Funerals and deaths appear to be the
only times men are given the freedom to cry
like this, to sob openly, to put their arms
around one another, or women, without feel-

ing uncomfortable.

When I went into the school, I also felt
a new kind of communication. Something en-
tirely new had happened to everyone there.
The same guys who often sat in the lounge
with sour expressions were softened and
open and hungering for talk, for descrip-
tions of how I felt when I heard the news,
for memories of times with Barb. And men
who had always been sensitive were concern-
ed about my present situation of loneliness,
in a job where I went through the day feel-
ing numb and sad, and no one else was exper-

iencing this with me. I found myself able
to tell my principal about a time when Barb-
ara had cried in the teachers' lounge. I

had never been able to talk of those things
with him before. I recalled Barb and my-
self sharing a similar astonishment at the
luck we had in marrying the men we did, and
the principal understood.

I walked out of the school sensing that
something very fine had been let loose in
everyone there. And I guess, the sight of
the tear-streaked faces of the men stays
with me most vividly. At the time there
were no behaviors assigned to men and women.
We held each other that day. We often
touched and we talked a lot. I hope it
does not take a funeral or a death to bring
about this kind of openness and freedom, but
that men and women can experience it simply
because it is the richest and fullest way
to learn about ourselves.

A Three-Part Series

“YOU’RE NOTHING BUT A

PACK OF CARDS”

The author was, until re-
cently, employed by a Twin Cities firm. In
May 1972 she filed a sex discrimination
charge against the corporation with the Minn-
esota Department of Human Rights. Subse-
quently, she also filed a charge of race and
sex discrimination against the corporation
with the federal Equal Employment Opportuni-
ties Commission (EEOC).

The State Commissioner of Human Rights, in
January 1973, returned a decision of ""no
probable cause” to assume the corporation
was discriminating against women. The auth-

""No, no:"" said the Queen. ""Sentence first--
verdict afterwards.""

""Stuff and nonsense!"" said Alice loudly.
""The idea of having the sentence first!""

""Hold your tongue:"" said the Queen, turning
purple.

""I won't,"" said Alice.

""Off with her head!"" the Queen shouted at the
top of her voice. Nobody moved.

""Who cares for you?"" said Alice (she had
grown to her full size by this time).
""You're nothing but a pack of cards!""

--Alice in Wonderland, Lewis
Carroll

In the past four years, women have begun to
use the legal tools at their disposal in eff-
orts to attain jobs that pay fairly, promo-
tions they deserve and expanded educational
opportunities. Today, news of sex discrimi-
nation charges and lawsuits regularly appear
in urban newspapers. Indeed, women have won
spectacular victories against bigoted emp-
loyers--American Telephone and Telegraph,
General Mills and General Motors are three of
the most famous offenders.

But the newspaper accounts don't tell one

what to expect day-to-day from co-workers,
superiors and state functionaries after fil-
ing a sex discrimination charge. I have been
through this process; my experience is sig-
nificant because it mirrors that of so many
women. I have learned what can and cannot
be accomplished by fighting bigoted employ-
ers through a State Human Rights Department.

“Down the Rabbit Hole”

In 1971 the job market was tight. I had just
completed graduate work for a Master's Degree
in American Studies at the University of
Minnesota. I had a Bachelor's Degree in
Journalism and approximately 3 1/2 years’
professional experience (much less than most
college graduates of 31, but I had spent an
inordinate amount of time traveling about the

by Mary Hastings

and her attorney appealed that decision
to the State Appeal Board. It overturned
the Commissioner's decision and sent the
charge back for reinvestigation. The State
Department of Human Rights has been in the
""reinvestigation"" process since April 1973.
The author has received no information con-
cerning this process and the State is under
no time limit. (The EEOC awaits the out-
come of the state charge before taking jur-
isdiction.)

""field"" and ""taking courses""

I was over-qualified for beginning journalism
positions and not at the “managerial” level.
I was in deep debt for my graduate education.
In November I accepted a position as editor
of an audio-tape program in the education de-
partment of a Twin Cities firm. I was seri-
ously underpaid, starting at $8,400 per year.
A man with the same job title and far less
education and responsibility started at
$10,000 per year and was raised, in six
months, to $11,000.

My first mistake was not negotiating for an
acceptable salary. My reasons for accepting
the low salary illustrate the confused state
I had been brought to by societal pressures
on and expectations of women. I needed money
but more pressing were my intense feelings
of failure. Most of these ""failure pangs""
sprang from my male-oriented view of the
world. I had been trained, like my male
peers, to measure my worth in ""impressive""
jobs, degrees and lifestyles--in a word, to
be a materialist.

Thus, I made a grave error even before I

was issued my employee I.D. (Later in my
battles with the company, the male attitude
was manifest: ""Well, why did you take the
job if you didn't like the salary?"" That
is, ""You had a choice--take the job and
shut up or go elsewhere. It is unnatural
for women to make demands."")

Having started on an unhappy note, I found  
that my job was a source of pain from the  
first day.  

I should note factors that made this most  
recent job different from others I have  
held:  

--I had begun to take a serious  
interest in feminism: Know-  
ledge of exploitation brings  
pain.  

--I was working for a private corp-  
oration. Previously I had either  
worked for a newspaper (a pri-  
vate corporation masquerading  
as citizens' advocate) or a  
university where certain degrees  
of nonconformity are tolerated,  
even applauded.  

--I was now working in an atmosphere  
of such stifling conformity that  
nothing I'd ever read, heard of or  
had nightmares about prepared me  
for the reality of it.  

Wonderland  

For seven months, I performed my duties.  
There was a mad, Hieronymous Bosch quality  
to my days. Males high and low in the corp-  
oration were feuding for reasons I could  
not fathom. (I am neither naive nor unin-  
telligent but to this day I cannot divine  
the motivation for the excess of savage com-  
petition and hateful behavior displayed by  
these men.) I, mindful of my debts and sec-  
retly ashamed of my cowardice in not quit-  
ting the job, struggled--swimming in the  
murky waters of departmental rivalry and  
I was tagged ""efficient”  
- That is, I was competent and,  
to my shame, willing to tolerate brutal rude  
ness and stupidity that made my teeth ache.  

Unfortunately, too, I could take little sol-  
ace in the work I produced. I had not ex-  
pected the job to be absorbing, but I had  
hoped to be allowed to perform as a compe-  
tent writer/editor. This was not to be.  

The program became a ""political football”  
(as do all projects in such a structure)  
and after many ""reviews"" and constipated con-  
ferences, I would have left the shards of my  
work--a program that said little and deeply  
embarrassed me.  

“Pig and Pepper”  

After seven months, however, I was transfer-  
red to the communications department. My  
transfer was by fiat of a high executive who  
had decided she liked me. I was happy to  
comply, as the education department was un-  
dergoing a ""shakeup"" that resulted in an at-  
mosphere just this side of the Gaza Strip. I  
also had a choice between two male supervi-  
sors--whether I stayed or transferred--men  
who I knew were no friends of women. I  
cast the die and chose the one I felt would  
be less obnoxious.  

The communications department was a male  
bastion. I was never welcomed in any way.  
And as time passed, I was very glad for  
that. It made my course uncomplicated. In-  
itially, of course, my silent isolation was  
difficult. I had always been in an atmos-  
phere where at least 50% of my peers liked  
me. Men who work in academia or ""quasi-  
creative"" occupations seemed better able to  
disguise their prejudices. Or, perhaps I  
had started to view males with a cold eye  
and they reciprocated.  

The move seemed providential, despite the  
cool reception. My new supervisor left me  
entirely alone to work as I saw fit. I  
was pleased and chose to regard this free-  
dom as a permanent state. (Alas, innocence).

Rules of the Game  

If you feel you have just cause to file a  
sex or race discrimination charge against  
your employer with the Minnesota State Hum-  
an Rights Department (or your state’s coun-  
terpart):  

1. CONTACT AN ATTORNEY AT ONCE  
She can give you valuable  
information and advice about  
filing the charge. She can also  
accompany you to the Department.  

Tell NO ONE connected with your  
employer that you contemplate  
filing a charge. You argue  
from a position of strength if  
you are an employee in good  
standing when the charge is  
served.  

Make a careful judgment as to  
whether your employer discrim-  
inates both on the bases of  
race and sex. If this is the  
case, talk with your attorney  
about joining race and sex dis-  
crimination in your charge. One  
of the saddest aspects of minor-  
ity struggles for justice is the  
white male's cunning attempts  
to set us at each other's throats.  

Resist the impulse to confide in  
male co-workers at any time.  
There are many sensitive men, but  
my experience tells me they are  
not yet ready to be involved  
in women's liberation.  

It is now Minnesota law that the  
State Department of Human Rights  
must conclude its investigation  
of your charge within 90 days of  
your filing. (The 90-day limit  
does not include ""conciliation""  
and/or appeal time, however.)"

1973",5,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No7_page005.txt,"On Monday morning, I arrived at work, attended to some details and informed my supervisor I would be “out of the building” for a time. I proceeded to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights in St. Paul. I had little hope that my claim could be accepted for investigation. I was interviewed by a very intelligent young woman.

sex discrimination, continued from page 7

“The Pool of Tears”

Also, over my seven months' employment, I had discovered I could work very well with women. This statement comes from one who had always been hostile to ""female subordinates,"" fearing association with them, and separating myself from them as much as possible. But having embraced feminism, I developed rapport with my female co-workers. Ninety-nine percent were secretaries.

(There were several other women professionals in the company, but we all had ""service-oriented"" jobs.) I grew to understand that I worked with a female secretary. She did not work for me; she was not my secretary.

Shortly after my transfer, I enrolled in a two-week seminar and was absent from the communications department.

Upon my return, a corporate executive gave me the greatest gift I have ever received—the opportunity to free myself forever from male standards.

The executive—for reasons still unclear to me—complained to my supervisor that I should not produce a program dealing with ""technical"" endeavors exclusively the province of males. My supervisor who—consciously or unconsciously—had been awaiting an opportunity to curtail my activities had a ""heart-to-heart"" talk with me in which he informed me it was not appropriate for a woman to take a large role in a ""technical"" field. He declaimed for some time, quoting Scripture and recalling the natural order of things. He concluded in a patronizing tone that I would be allowed to ""coordinate"" the program but would no longer play a major role in it.

During this amazing interview, I responded in a passive, non-involved manner. I had just had a job review that rated me an excellent employee. Needless to say, I was nonplused.

“The Rabbit Sends in a Little ‘Bill’

That hot May weekend I made the decision to file a sex discrimination charge against my employer. I was frightened but did not want to be humiliated further by the male who heard my nervous but factual account of my supervisor's sermon. She informed me that the case was ""difficult"" but the State could investigate.

Following the interview, I signed a form and dated it. Within a week or so, I would receive a copy and the company would be served with a copy by mail. The charge was addressed to the President of the corporation and my supervisor.

(I had not retained an attorney and did not plan to.) This is a grave error. Consult an attorney immediately if you feel you have just cause to file a sex discrimination charge. Because I had not consulted an attorney at the outset, I did not know that I could have filed a charge with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission at the same time I filed the state charge.

I fear that initially I viewed the State Department as a ""protector."" Nothing is further from the truth. This Department should be absolutely neutral in investigations—it is neither an advocate for complainant (myself) nor respondent (the company). The Minnesota Department of Human Rights is also understaffed and overworked. And I regard its male employees as a fair cross-section of male attitudes toward women.

If you need an attorney and are in the Twin Cities area, contact Women's Advocates: 227-2504 (St. Paul) for attorney referral.

I returned to my office and proceeded for the next week and a half to work in the mode dictated by my supervisor.

Nothing changed—on the surface. My supervisor did, indeed, treat me with more kindly condescension than had been his wont. (I found I preferred the wary measuring of two weeks past.) I behaved in my usual manner. I had been a most accommodating, soft-voiced woman. I had never visibly lost my temper, although it cost me many stomach pains and tight lines at the mouth. I had never demanded what was my due, had never insisted on cooperation or timely performance of interviews, ""reviews"" or conferences.

Sister Annabelle Raiche,  
Chair of the Education Depart-  
ment at the College of St.  
Catherine, St. Paul, went to  
the University of San Francis-  
co for a Symposium on Ignatian  
Spirituality July 15-31.  

July 31 she went to jail.  

It started out as a day of  
solidarity with the United  
Farm Workers for the partici-  
pants in the symposium. Ninety-  
five priests and nuns went  
to Parlier to support the UFW  
as observers. They were greeted  
by Cesar Chavez, who asked  
if they had the time and the  
commitment to join the picket  
line.  

""That's when I decided I  
would join them,"" Sister Anna-  
belle said, even though they  
knew they would be imprisoned  
for an indefinite period of  
time. Sixteen sisters and  
sixteen priests joined about  
300 other people to form pick-  
et lines on two nectarine  
ranches.  

The picketers formed a line  
facing a line of ranch owners.  
""You could tell they were very  
frightened men,"" Sister Anna-  
belle said, by the sticks,  
crowbars, and rubber hoses that  
they carried, and by the two  
unleashed dogs with them. The  
picketers carried nothing.  
They were silent, sang hymns,  
or chanted prayers. From time  
to time they spoke to the  
scabs working in the fields,  
trying to call them out. They  
persuaded four of the workers  
to leave.  

After about four hours, the  
police began arresting them.  

A policewoman began reading  
the women their charges. The  
Chicanas, experienced in be-  
ing arrested, shouted during  
the reading so they would not  
hear their charges, and would  
be illegally arrested.  

The picketers were taken to  
the Fresno County Industrial  
Farm where they were frisked,  
fingerprinted, and photographed.  
After two days of waiting,  
they were arraigned for  
""riot, rout, disorderly con-  
duct, and unlawful assembly.""  

by Jan Jirak  

The UFW's lawyers pleaded “not  
guilty."" They were judged not  
trustworthy to be released on  
their own recognizance. Bail  
was set at $400.  

In the prison, ""we set our  
own pattern of life; no day  
ever dragged."" There was al-  

ways cleaning, praying, read-  
ing, or some sort of activity  
in progress.  

Cesar Chavez  

Sister Annabelle Raiche  

had told the nuns, “Ask the  
women what their life is  
like."" Sister Annabelle took  
his advice.  

There was Petra. She was 29  
years old and had seven child-  
ren. Her day started at 3 a.m.,  
when she rose to do the clean-  
ing and cooking. After break-  
fast the family went to the  
fields. When supper ended the  
long day, it was time for bed.  
Petra said, ""The only time we  
have together is on Sunday af-  
ter Mass.""  

The strength of the farm wor-  
kers is exemplified by a woman  
named Estafana. She is the  
mother of 8 children, the  
youngest 6 months old. She  
was feverishly ill when she  
was in jail. The Farm Workers  
doctor told her she should go  
straight to bed and stay  
there. After the doctor saw  
her, the prison officials  

brought her to their office  
and tried to convince her to  
leave the prison. (Everyone  
had agreed that, as a sign of  
unity, no one would leave the  
prison unless they all did.)  
Estafana, in spite of her ill-  
ness, in spite of her child-  
ren, withstood twenty minutes  
of persuasion and refused to  
leave without the others.  

Sister Annabelle and the  
rest of the prisoners were re-  
leased on August 13 at 12:30  
a.m. A sister from her commu-  
nity in the Los Angeles pro-  
vince met her in a park and  
drove her to her convent where  
she spent the rest of the  
night.  

Sister Annabelle says,  
""It's left its mark on me,""  
and is still leaving its mark.  
As an educator, she noticed  
that although the Chicanas  
were largely illiterate, they  
were in many ways more educa-  
ted than she was. This was  
first brought home to her by  

the realization that she  
could not speak to them in  
their language, but they  
could speak to her in hers.  
About half the women were bi-  
lingual.  

She said the women knew a-  
bout the movement they were  
involved in (""la causa"") and  
could speak about it articu-  
lately. Their leader was 19-  
year-old Gloria, who could  
translate instantaneously,  
and did so when people of ei-  
ther language visited.  

Although there were 54 wo-  
men in one barracks where they  
lived in dormitory style with  
little physical privacy, the  
Chicanas afforded each other  
an adequate measure of ""psy-  
chic privacy."" ""I never felt  
crowded or that my privacy was  
being infringed upon,"" said  
Sister Annabelle.  

The experience made her  
think about the strength that  
comes from powerlessness. It  
is the will to make a better  
life, the freedom from mater-  
ial possessions. It is the  
strength that comes from hav-  
ing nothing to lose.

AYER  

I happened to visit the Women's Erotic Art  
Show in the company of a man who joked about  
his nervousness at the prospect of being  
made into a sex symbol. As it turned out,  
nothing of the sort was in sight when we ar-  
rived at the Guild of Performing Arts where  
the show was held. I suspect that it will  
be some while before more people understand  
that feminists are not particularly interes-  
ted in mirror views, except perhaps as in-  
structive examples. We have too many objec-  
tions to the structure of society to blithe-  
ly do unto men as they have done unto us.  

So what constitutes female eroticism if  
not images of nude men with genitals waving?  
The women have put together a highly cere-  
bral collection which sees sexuality as a  
part of a social continuum, rather than a  
prurient pause. The almost formulaic attrac-  
tion of exposed organs topped by steamy  
glances plays a small role in this exhibi-  

tion.  
Humor rears its unpredictable head more  

than once, although I do not think every-  
body will laugh on cue. Take Susan Fiene  
Brown's ceramic ""Adjustable Tit-Tureen"" with  
its large breast demurely balanced on paw-  
like legs. The gears protrude from the base  
of the breast which is surrounded by a move-  
able shell. The idea is that the gears con-  
trol the position of the shell so that the  
viewer may have a breast of exactly the de-  
sired size.  

Another comic achievement is ""What More Do  
You Want?"" a cartoon by Marcella Williams.  
Somewhat in the Steig tradition, this simple  
drawing shows a naked woman reclining on her  
elbows. She is casting a wanly ironic gaze  
at a fierce little man who has entered her  
and lies engulfed to his shoulders. He has  
tossed the title question at his conqueror  
with such irritable ill will that I couldn't  
help but side with her. I imagine that  
other viewers, feminist or not, will enter  
much the same allegiance.  

These jocular approaches to the human body  
will probably arouse little erectile tissue  
in passersby. Eroticism has traditionally  
been a method of ""getting away from it all,""  
and there has been no place in it for annoy-  
ing social commentary.  

The Women's Erotic Art Show changes all  
that. In practice, thought usually enhances,  
rather than inhibits, sexual pleasure. It's  
time that erotic artists appreciate the  
spice that comes from mental additives.  

Two related entries concentrate on female  
genitals. Debra Lorensen's fabric ""Refuge""  
is a white cylinder with a warm red interior.  
Deep in the interior is a small, provocative  
button.  

A mixed media piece by Patricia Kerr exhi-  
bits a similarly impassive sensuality. A  
wooden carton with “Danger...Fuzes"" marked  
on the sides is filled with white fur. A  
large, luminous red globe extrudes through  
a zippered opening in the furs and appears  

A Review  
by Susan Cushman  

almost to throb.  

I was not surprised at this interest in  
female bodies. The male body has been so  
diligently protected from the exposure which  
eroticism demands, that there is little  
groundwork for artists to share if they in-  
cline toward the subject. After all, do you  
show them up or down? How do you keep them  
from looking just a bit silly?  

Naked women, of course, never look silly,  
because we are too used to seeing ourselves  
portrayed that way. But women artists do  
have an obligation to invigorate some tired  
old conceptions that have been around too  
long. When women turn appreciative, knowing  
eyes on each other, the manmade artistic  
stereotypes are bound to slip out of view.  

The Women's Erotic Art Show is intimate,  
with 47 entries, and recommended. It con-  
tinues at the Guild of Performing Arts,  

504 Cedar Avenue through October 31.  

The gracefulness of Libra, it has been  
remarked, is like that of a Gothic arch:  
beauty based on balanced stress.  

Venus rules this sign: Venus, planet of  
love and art, representative of the des-  
cent of spirit into matter. For Venus-  
ruled Taurus, this manifests itself as  
earthy sensuality. But for Libra, the  
Venusian qualities are revealed as an  
abstract arrangement of opposing forces:  
hence the stereotypical disputative Libran  
always ready to take the ""other side.""  

The critical Libran consideration is  
the appropriate division of energy between  
social and personal needs. Born near the  
autumn equinox--when the light-ego is fast  
losing hours to the darkness-collective--  
Libra tends to overemphasize social  
demands. But the still-strong ego asserts  
itself regularly. Like its opposite, asser-  
tive Aries, the Libran perches on an un-  
easy edge between the demands of the inner  
self and those of the outward society. In  
contrast to Aries, however, Libra argues  
for the larger view, never using conflict  
to define personal territory.  

That Libra is often praised as a ""femi-  
nine"" sign--while it is actually an out-  
ward or ""masculine"" sign--is an interest-  
ing phenomenon. The rulership of Venus no  
doubt accounts for some of this attribu-  
tion, but Libra's tendency towards ex-  
cessive acculturation could as well be  
cited as cause. Luckily for Libran women,  
this balance between inward and outward  
represents a kind of androgyny, in that  
the Libran--always looking at both sides--  
is usually able to accept both her ""male""  
and “female"" qualities.

discrimination because cleaning is cleaning,""
he said. ""In the past we heard arguments
that a janitor does all the heavy work--run-
ning the buffer and big mops--while custodial
workers do only light chores. But it was our
judgment that there's not $100 a month diff-
erence between the two positions.""

Battles Lost

""Much as I have already stated on the viru-
lent effects of this discharge, I have to
state, in addition, that bees, it is a well-
known fact, will forsake their hives if
touched by a menstruous woman; that linen
boiling in the cauldron will turn black,
that the edge of a razor will become
blunted, and that copper vessels will con-
tract a fetid smell and become covered with
‘verdigrease, on coming in contact with her.
A mare big with foal, if touched by a woman
in this state, will be sure to miscarry; nay,
even more than this, at the very sight of a
woman, though seen at a distance even should
she happen to be menstruating for the first
time after the loss of her virginity, or for
the first time, while in a state of virgini-
ty. The bitumen that is found in Judaea,
will yield to nothing but the menstrual dis-
charge; its tenacity being overcome, as al-
ready stated, by the agency of a thread from
a garment which has been brought in contact
with this fluid. Fire itself even, an ele-
ment which triumphs over every other sub-
stance, is unable to conquer this; for if re-
duced to ashes and then sprinkled upon gar-
ments when about to be scoured, it will
change their purple tint, and tarnish the
brightness of the colors. Indeed so perni-
cious are its properties, that women them-
selves, the source from which it is derived,
are far from being proof against its effects;
a pregnant woman, for instance, if touched
with it, or indeed if she so much as steps
over it, will be liable to miscarry.

Keen, sometimes tearful disappointment was
voiced by many representatives of the Epis-
copal Church after its convention refused to
admit women to its priesthood...The narrow
defeat of the proposal to permit ordination
came in a complex bloc-voting system that
rejected it even though a majority of in-
dividual votes actually were for it. Oppo-
nents insisted that preservation of an ex-
clusively male clergy was essential to main-
tain the church's tradition and further re-
lationships with Roman Catholicism and East-
ern Orthodoxy, which do not ordain women.

very much down and out  
in the decision making

in a meeting last week be-

height and weight restric-

reflect needs of the job.

the stance of a willing,  

advisor, was kept on the  
defensive much of the time.

SKILLS BANK  

His announcement that Ed  
McGaw, a local coordinator  
of AIM, was his new appoin-  
tee as deputy Director of  
the Human Rights Dept. drew  
several groans. It seems  
these women have made many  
unsuccessful attempts to  
convince McGaw of the jus-  
tice of or even the meaning  
of a women's rights move-  
ment.  

Embarrassed earlier by a  
lack of any employment  
figures on women in city  
government, Cohen now had  
to admit he “hadn't thought  
to question” McGaw on  
women's rights issues.  

Yes, he realized that  

many of the complaints  
received by Human Rights  
were under sex discrim-  
ination. Yes, someone  

in his position should  

be aware of sexism in  

the city departments.  

No, he didn't feel firing  
McGaw, police chief Rowan  
(who he didn't appoint),  
or Ken Jones and publicly  
announcing the cause as  
sexism, would help the  
matter. He seemed dis-  
turbed, however, and at  
least made a promise to  
change the situation.  
Other concerns of the  
group were also taken  
into consideration by  
Cohen. It was requested  
that the Consumer Protec-

LIFE IN  
MIDDLE EARTH  
A St. Paul art shop and  
gallery is currently fea-  
turing the work of four  
local artists, two of the  
women. Their exhibits are  
at Middle Earth, 2042  
St. Clair Ave. and will  
continue through Oct. 31.  
A variety of prints done  
by lithograph, etching,  
seriograph, and block  
printing are being shown  
by former Minneapolis art  
instructor, Joan Bohlig.  
Her main subjects, child-  
ren and nature objects,  
seem stereotypical areas  
for a woman, but are made  
interesting by her mostly  
imagistic style of work.  
Bohlig also creates non-  
representational collages  
as a form of painting. She  
regards her interpretation  
of sprouts and melting  
snow, etc. primarily as  
""statements about color,  
arrangement and pattern.""  
Large, unconventional and  
imaginative wall hangings  
are the work of the second  
woman artist, Riana Scamp.  
They are made mostly from  
macramé twine with such  
additions as shells and  
beads placed for specific  
effect. Originally from  
Holland, Scamp has won  
numerous awards for her  
creations and is a maker  
of fine jewelry as well.  
The two men in the show,  
Mike Ehrigh and Doug John-  
son, also present some in-  
teresting work in pottery  
and blown glass. It's a  
small exhibit, but worth  
seeing, whether you want  
to buy or just look. More

I have always thought soli-
tude essential in order to get
in touch with oneself and be-
come a strong, autonomous per-
son. Solitude can be peace-
ful, an inward-tuning time of
self-exploration.

For most people in the west-
ern world, however, solitude
is feared and avoided. They
do not know how to make con-
structive use of solitude,
and this is especially true

of women.
A woman is taught from the

earliest moments of infancy
that she will never be alone.
Indeed, she is taught that a-
loneness is a lack rather than
an opportunity. She expects
to marry, have children, grand
children. She is trained to
find escape from loneliness
not in herself, from whom she
could learn the most, or from
other women, with whom she has
the most in common, but from
men, who have shared and un-
derstand few of her vital exper-
iences and feelings, and from
children, who are unequipped
for adult relationships.

loneliness

In her book The Woman Alone

(The New York Times Book Co.,
278 pp., $7.95) Patricia
O'Brien tells that she lived
just such a life for most of
her years. She spent her
childhood and young adulthood
dreaming of marriage, which
materialized after her sopho-
more year in college; she
dropped out and bore four
children.

In spite of her fulfilled
dreams, she was unhappy. She
began to learn some lessons
about loneliness. ""I could
not understand what was hap-
pening. I had everything I
was ever supposed to have
wanted, yet I would find my-
self crying while I folded di-
apers. Was it loneliness I
felt? But how could I be
lonely? People were around
constantly. My life had shape
and direction and substance—
what was wrong with me? In
fact I had been alone only one
time in my life, a night short-
ly after my fourth daughter
was born. I remember twice
turning off the lights and try-
ing to go to sleep, each time
getting up and turning them on
again, irritated with my cow-
ardice but too filled with

She decided to finish col-
lege with a major in journal-
ism. ""We bought an old Ply-
mouth for $100 and I drove to
school each morning, singing
with the radio, thinking new
ideas and feeling new emo-
tions. I loved that car. It
gave me wings.""

After graduation, she took a
reporting job. While her love
for her work increased, her
marriage ran into trouble.
After a year of futile coun-
seling, she decided to leave.
She took a job on the Chicago
Sun-Times, 80 miles away, and
came home on weekends. Thus
began two years of being alone
the first real solitude she
had ever known. During that
time she met and conquered
loneliness, came to know and
love herself through her sol-
itude and by seeking out
other women alone.

O'Brien recounts the devel-
opment of her sense of
strength and identification
with other women. She re-
cords scores of stories of
women in diverse situations,
all part of the collective
female experience.

Ms. O'Brien tells these sto-
ries with sympathy and percep-

""But on this particular day,

Landlords would complain. The

relationships, because we have  
made what is natural a distor-

But if women can't reach out  
for other women, nor men for  
other men, aren't we less ab-  
le to realize love in a full  
sense? Haven't we, then, all  
lost something?""  

Power  

O'Brien learned to under-  
stand the powerlessness of wo-  
men. ""I sometimes have felt  
painfully inarticulate in work  
situations, usually when they  
are of particular importance  
to me. One day I went into  
my editor's office with an  
idea for a story, first care-  
fully preparing what I wanted  
to say, defensive about how  
good it might be and afraid  
he would think it was terri-  
ble. In the midst of our un-  
derstandably stilted conversa-  
tion a male reporter strolled  
in, greeted the editor, and  
casually talked about a pro-  
ject that interested him,  
throwing in a request for  
time off. The two men, both  

outwardly relaxed and easy,  
negotiated a bit and settled  
the problem within a few mo-  
ments. I sat there, my  
speech out the window, envi-  
ous and frustrated, wondering  
why that type of encounter  
came so easily for the man  
and so hard for me.  

""David Riesman has sugges-  
ted that a basic problem for  
working women is they do not  
know how to make use of the  
informal structure that men  
use in the process of advan-  
cing their careers. Women  
are not and never will be  
casual members of the undefin-  
able but always present male  
circle, whether in the office,  
the city room, the factory,  
or the university, which is  
why, if they want to achieve,  
they must work twice as hard  
as their male counterparts.  
Men no longer believe in Hor-  
atio Alger, but it seems many  
women do, and they have for-  
gotten he was a man.""  

O'Brien emphasizes that  
seizing power means a willing-  
ness to risk, whether it be  
failure or unpopularity.  
Choosing solitude means risk-—  
ing loneliness--but success  
is impossible without risk,  
and is the beginning of liber-

1973",13,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No7_page013.txt,"Midwifery Frees Women From

By Heit Kemper.

A quiet revolution in maternity care is
taking place in the Twin Cities.

Pregnancy and childbirth are functions of
normal, healthy women, but until recently,
illness-oriented care has been given to the
99.9 percent of women who give birth to
their children in hospitals. Obstetricians
and nurses agree that 90 percent of births
are normal and could be safely attended by
trained midwives in a more comfortable set-
ting.

Now that advances in medical technology
have made a safe birth experience almost a
foregone conclusion, people are now turning
their attention to making childbirth exper-
ience emotionally satisfying as well.

This revolution is quiet for several rea-
sons. There is a real need for caution while
developing alternative childbirth methods
that are necessarily dependent on the estab-
lished medical community for back-up assist-
ance in case of emergency. With the lowest
birth rate in recent years, an alternative
style of childbirth is seen as a threat to
the general practitioner and obstetrician's
bread and butter.

But what is bread and butter to the ob-
stetrician is meat and drink to the midwife,
according to a local pioneer in family-cen-
tered childbirth.

Control and Choice in Childbirth

This is also a revolution—manned by
consumers demanding control and choice in
what can be a most interesting, joyous phys-
ical experience.

Changes in childbirth are being influ-
enced from outside as well as inside the med-
ical professions. Private groups like the
Childbirth Education Association have grown
at a spectacular rate. And this has happen-
ed at a time when the birth rate in the
Twin Cities has dropped from 134 births per
1,000 in 1960 to 20 births per 1,000 in 1968
(the last available figure).

Last year the Childbirth Education Assoc-
iation (CEA) trained more than 1,300 couples
in prepared childbirth techniques. The CEA
now has more applications than it can hand-
le.

Men are re-entering the ceremony of birth
to be with their women in the delivery room.
A few years ago, this was unheard of and e-
ven prohibited by hospital regulations.

Less than ten years ago, a man in California
chained himself to his wife so they could
experience their child's birth together. The
hospital attempted legal action against him.

Women can have babies in a variety of
ways. Ether and forceps were an advance
that had women being delivered of their
children, rather than actively taking part.
You can still have a ""knock ‘em out, drag
‘em out"" delivery or you can be temporarily
paralyzed by spinal anesthetics or be eased
by gases to inhale. There are anesthetics
(per-cervical block) that can numb the uter-
us for a short period of time and provide
a helpful rest during labor. Breathing ex-
ercises and learning how to ride with con-
tractions rather than fighting against them
can ease a labor considerably.

Childbirth’s “Chains”

With knowledge of the variety available
to them, couples are choosing obstetrical
care according to their own personal phil-
osophies, even if it means shopping around
for the right doctor or midwife. And you can
be sure that patients taking their bus-
iness elsewhere will have an effect on the
kind of care offered in the future.

Changes in childbirth style have been
happening faster than the medical profession
or individuals can keep track of. One ma-
jor change is the demise of the traditional
granny midwife and the rise of a new pro-
fessional—the nurse-midwife.

Granny midwifery (rhymes with sniffery)
in Minnesota is not far behind us. Mrs.
Ebba Kirschbaum, the last midwife licensed
by the Minnesota Medical Board of Examiners,
retired last year after aiding the birth of
almost 1,700 children. Her retirement also
brought an end to home deliveries, at least
for the time being.

Lucy Cutler was one of the last women
Mrs. Kirschbaum attended. Ms. Cutler has
experienced both hospital and home deliver-
ies and is vocal about the differences. She
had her first child in a hospital.

""Hospitals are geared to curing the prob-
lems they cause,"" says Ms. Cutler. She and
her husband, Bruce, figure they spent $70
per hour for a doctor to endanger two lives
and ignore their wishes.

Ms. Cutler says her obstetrician's manner
was deceptive. They had discussed her wishes
for no anesthetic or restraints during del-
ivery (women are routinely strapped down
for delivery in modern hospitals).

""He seemed to go along with my ideas,
he didn't disagree with me. He was very
relaxed and casual, which I liked,"" she
continues.

Her confidence was shaken when she asked
for advice on labor and delivery during an
office visit near the end of her pregnancy.
Her doctor told her not to worry, that it
was too early to discuss it. She went into
labor the next week.

During her labor, Ms. Cutler was given a
""routine anesthetic"" despite her protesta-
tions—a spinal block (which deadens feel-
ing from the waist down, interfering with
the control women had up to that point).

Her legs were restrained in stirrups against
her wishes.

When her child was born, she thought it
was someone else's child crying—she did not
feel the birth she had so happily antic-
ipated.

""It was worse than a rape,"" she says.
""At least with a rape you have many other
opportunities to have a positive experience.
But you don't have too many chances to ex-
perience birth.""

Angered by their experiences with hospi-
tal delivery, the Cutlers sought out Ebba
Kirschbaum to deliver their next child at

home. Lucy Cutler embroidered a special  
birth dress for the occasion and consulted  
Mrs. Kirschbaum frequently during her preg-  
nancy. When labor began, Mrs. Kirschbaum  
went to the Cutler home to attend the birth.  

""She was like a wedding attendant who  
arranges the bride's hair,"" says Ms. Cutler.  
""In my own home I was free to yell without  
disturbing anyone or getting medication  
against my will. It felt good to yell.  
Kirschbaum asked me if I wanted gas. I said  
no and that was it.""  

Was she afraid of the dangers of home  
deliveries?  

""If you die in a hospital, it's OK,"" says  
Ms. Cutler. ""But if you cough at home you're  
taking a risk! I'd feel guiltier if I went  
to a hospital and something went wrong.""  

Lucy Cutler doesn't have much faith in the  
family-centered maternity care being offered  
by hospitals in the area. ""To me that means  
when the nurses and staff have nothing else  
to do they will attend to my needs,"" she  
says.  

When General Hospital was asking public  
feedback while planning the new maternity  
wing, Cutler submitted a plan that reflects  
her professional background in wildlife  
management.  

Her plans consider the instinctual de-  
sires of women in labor, patterned after  
the universal behavior of animals in labor.  

Her facility would have as little to do  
with illness as possible. It would have  
lamps and double beds and be similar to a  
motel where ""you could kick off your shoes  
and close the door-- a place where you could  
come with your chosen companions, your own  
blankets and other nesting equipment and  
stake out your territorial claim."" Cutler  
says a woman in labor who knows what is  
going on should be the final authority re-  
garding her care during childbirth.  

Private room at Hennepin General  

Margaret Hewitt, a nurse-midwife at  
Hennepin County General Hospital, agrees.  
She informs us that there is now one room  
at General where patients can labor, deliv-  
er and recover and return home soon after  
birth.  

""This is a pilot thing to see if this is  
what women really want. But how many come  
to General to have their children?"" says  
Ms. Hewitt who delivers about one baby a  
week herself.  

If women make use of this alternative,  
there are ten other private rooms that  
could be used this way.  

""If we found this was an up and coming  
thing we would have them available too,""  
says Ms. Hewitt.  

Hewitt sees no medical support for home  
births. ""I would prefer that couples att-  
empting home births do it alone rather  
than depend on untrained attendants,"" she  
says. ""At the first sign of trouble, the  
couple would be more likely to seek medical  
help.""  

Ms. Hewitt sees benefits in women's re-  
newed participation in their birth exper-  
iences, ""In the last 70 years, birth has  
been taken over by men and the benefits of  

that system have run out,"" she says. ""The  
highest reproductive act for the male  
is orgasm. Childbirth is women's highest.""  

""Doctors say I will take over and de-  
liver you of your child. I will give you  
knowledge, be technical advisor and inter-  
vene for your safety,"" she continues.  

""But men cannot understand women's sex-  
uality any more than women can understand  
the nature of man's.""  

Another energetic woman making changes  

in the local childbirth experience is  

Sharon Rising at the University of Minnesota  
School of Nursing.  

Her plan for a master's degree program in  
nurse-midwifery became a reality this fall.  
Ninety women applied for entrance into the  
two-year program. Six full-time and ten  
part-time students have begun training.  

This is not granny midwifery but an  
extension of the nursing function with the  
backup of modern medical expertise and fac-  
ilities in case of emergency. The training  
will emphasize the comfort and emotional  
needs of pregnant women through a contin-  
uous woman-to-woman relationship.  

Rising has been working on plans for a  
separate child-bearing, child-rearing, fam-  
ily planning clinic. It would be an altern-  
ative to existing family care, providing a  
place for home-centered childbirth and t  
training for nurse-midwives. It could also  
be the base for a group midwifery practice,  
in which women would have one midwife for  
primary care but know them all in case her  
primary midwife was unable to attend her  
birth.  

Other health care professionals, ped-  
iatricians and child psychologists are in-  
terested in Rising's clinic, but until fund-  
ing is available, it will remain a plan.  
Funding is particularly difficult, says  
Rising, because this community is consider-  
ed to have good existing health care facil-  
ities. It requires active lobbying on the  
part of consumers to support alternatives.  

And pressure from consumers brings al-  
ternatives into existence. When Sharon Ri-  
sing completed her training at Yale less  
than five years ago, there were few places  
where she could practice her profession. Be-  
cause of women's interest in woman-to-  
woman childbirth care, hospitals are now  
looking for nurse-midwives and private ob-  
stetrical practices are wanting to include  
midwifery in the services they offer pati-  
ents.  

But it will be vital to the establish-  
ment of midwifery as an alternative for mid-  
wives to be accepted as colleagues, not sub-  
ordinates on these staffs, Rising warns.  

Renewed interest in midwifery parallels  
the women's movement of the past few years.  
The mystical role of the male doctor dimin-  
ishes as the woman-to-woman relation-  
ships grow stronger. But change will be  
necessary from inside the medical commun-  
ity.  

The image of the midwife as a crafty,  
backwoods woman operating in crude con-  
ditions still hangs on. But according to  
Sharon Rising, this is the reverse of what  
it should be. The trained nurse-midwife"
GoldFlower,2,7,"oct.

1973",15,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No7_page015.txt,"it  
Midwifery Time  

should be handling the uncomplicated birth  
in a medically sound environment and the  
specialist with training in the complica-  
tions and diseases of pregnancy should be  
reaching patients in outlying areas.  

""The most significant changes in mid-  
wifery will have to come within the estab-  
lished systems,"" says Rising. ""Midwifery  

has existed outside the medical community.  
Doctors have seen only the negative side of  
it when something goes wrong.""  

This is unfortunate since midwifery  
requires the backup of established medical  
institutions to function properly. Mid-  
wifery is for healthy normal pregnancy and  
the value of the obstetrician's skill and  
expertise in an emergency are not to be dis-  
counted.  

But obstetricians rarely take the time to  
deal with the pregnant human being and this  
is an advantage of continuous woman-to-woman  
care by a midwife. An office visit en-  
compasses the woman's feelings and fears  
as well as her physical condition. And a  
midwife helps guide the patient's labor  
rather than arriving in the nick of time  
to catch the baby.  

Utilizing midwives could lessen the  
cost of OB care. The care would be more  
extensive in terms of time spent with the  
patient, but the expensive emergency  
equipment used in every hospital delivery  
room could be limited to one emergency  
room, bringing down the overhead.  

Another factor in the cost of midwife  
care is insurance. At the present time,  
midwifery is not recognized as medical  
care by insurance companies. This is an-  
other area where consumer pressure must  
bring about change.

PROGRESS WHEN HE STICKS HIS NECK OUT.  
Across the street from Rising's office,  
Ms. Lois Sonstegard, clinical director of  
obstetrics and gynecology at the University  
of Minnesota Hospitals is also sticking her  
neck out on behalf of women.  

Rules and regulations which interfere  
with satisfying childbearing are being ov-  
ercome by Ms. Sonstegard's carefully laid  

groundwork.  

Many women wish to nurse their newborns  
immediately after delivery. Knowing  

this is psychologically and emotionally ben-  
eficial to mothers and infants and also know-  
ing that it was against hospital policy,  

Ms. Sonstegard allowed it anyway.  

After a period of time, she proposed a  
change of rules to her superiors. When met  
with negative reactions and concern for the  
risks involved, she produced evidence that  
the risks were negligible and were far out-  
weighed by the satisfaction of the patients.  
The rules were changed and parents can now  
hold and nurse their newborns before they  
are taken to the nursery for routine tests  
and observation.  

Another disadvantage of hospital delivery  
is a mother's separation from her other chi-  
ldren. Sonstegard is instituting a chil-  
dren's visiting hour to ease the separation  
for both mother and child and give the fam-  
ily a chance to adjust to a new member.  

""The goal is the most satisfying child-  
birth experience for the people concerned,""  
said Ms. Sonstegard. ""There should be no  
feeling of guilt or disappointment or won-  
dering ‘how did I do',"" she continued. ""  
""When medical care is safe, better care for  
the whole person is important.""  

And women all over the Twin Cities area  
are making that happen.

box. In it lay an envelope bearing the blue
Minnesota State Department of Human Rights
seal. I returned to work, high on adrenalin,
and awaited a confrontation. Nothing hap-
pened. All day I studied my supervisor.

His milky eyes were blank. I weighed the
mechanical, furry greetings of the corporate
executives. (This was an intimate company.)
Nothing there.

By evening I was in a frenzy. I drove my
friends wild with conjecture: Would the
company treat my charge with lofty disdain
not even deigning to acknowledge it? Were
they plotting some stunning reprisal? I
awaited morning when I was called into my
supervisor's office. He informed me in a
choked tone that he had received a copy

of the ""suit"". (From here on for the next
year and a half, all company officials re-
ferred to my charge as a ""suit"". This pe-
culiarity of speech may or may not reveal
something about the male human being.)

My supervisor's eyes were not blank now.
They were filled with hatred and something
new: respect.

Women’s
Clearinghouse

Women's Clearinghouse began
in January 1972 with a twice-
weekly five-minute news broad-
cast on KUOM Radio (770-AM),
covering issues of concern to
women. We have come togeth-
er under the credo that con-
munications in all forms is
vital to the purposes and
goals of the women's move-
ment. In addition to our
regular broadcast, we also o-
ccasionally produce radio
specials with a particular
focus on some aspect of wom-
en's lives, either of current
pertinence or of significance
in women's history.

We are a small volunteer
group (generally 4-6 women),
and have come from an assort-
ment of backgrounds and
groups, bringing a variety of
talents. None have had for-
mal broadcasting education
but gain radio skills through
the experience of Women's
Clearinghouse. We do not
have a hierarchy of responsi-
bilities, thus each member
may expect to gain skills in
announcing, script-writing,
interviewing, operating equip-
ment, etc. Experimental Col-
lege has donated office space
to us at 1507 University Ave.

Our broadcasts are aired Tues-
day and Friday.* If you have

GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,4,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page004.txt,"Women’s Magazines: A Cursory Review

Time was, about a year ago, when every-
thing would stop once the newest issue of Ms.
magazine hit the supermarket magazine rack.
Projects, work, and plans for the day were
all pushed aside until the magazine had been

read cover to cover. 

But things change. And so do people.

Many of my friends are finding Ms. less in-
teresting this fall. Is the magazine fading,
or are we just finding other forums for
feminist debates? Are other magazines pick-
ing up the cause? Do new magazines like
Playgirl and New Woman have any implications
for the women's movement? And are the old
newsstand (un)reliables to be trusted any
more than before?

New Woman competes well with Ms. from the
looks of the cover. But there the similarity
ends. While the flashy headline ""What About
POW Wives?"" on the cover of Ms. belies a more

serious article within, ""The Three Faces of
the Single Parent"" on the cover of New

Woman leads to little more than scant copy
and photographs of a fashionable bleached
blonde running through parks with her kids
and standing in the moonlight on the shore
of Lake Michigan with her lover. Topics that
deserve in-depth treatment (""Why Women Go
Winky-Wonky Over Homosexual Men"") are given
a flip review which is more infuriating than
disappointing. Columns for the trendy hos-
tess on ""What's In and Out in Food"" are more
boring than most, and reprints from Reader's
Digest about ""How a (Female) High School
Dropout Built a Business That Does More Than
$150 Million a Year"" simply do not interest
me. But the main quality which makes New
Woman by far the most offensive women's maga-
zine on the market is its guise of not only
showing a very glamorous swinging lifestyle
which is as unrealistic as ever, but daring
to call it that of the ""new woman."" Heaven
forbid.

A Pleasant Relief

A new crop of magazines dealing with the
life of single persons is encouraging and
generally aimed at both sexes. Singles is
written for the swinging crowd with neither
the pretensions nor pocketbooks of the Playboy
crew. Although it promotes a classic stereo-
type of dating and socialization on the way
to marriage, it is no more condescending to
women than it is to men. Single (without the
""s"") has a few shallow articles, but attempts
to confront the subject of living alone more
realistically than any other periodical. For
one thing, it accepts the situation as being
normal and even desirable for most adults at
some stage in their lives. Articles like
""Why Should Singles Pay 20% More in Taxes?"",
""Sex When You're Alone,"" and a story on the
National Organization for Non-Parents raise
some important questions, but unfortunately
gloss over the answers. The magazine simply
lacks sufficient depth in its reporting.
Although its bias is clearly towards the
""unmarried, divorced, widowed and unattached""
of either sex, it also reflects positively
on the female single which is a pleasant
relief.

The Playful Penis

For people who get off on penises bathed
in red-gold light, Playgirl, Viva, Venus
and a good slug of companion magazines are
stylishly filling a void of sorts in the
pornographic world. At least women now have
the chance to participate legitimately in

by Kate Ligare

the drugstore ritual of paging through maga-
zine racks with all the nonchalance one can
muster. If you're curious, you won't be dis-
appointed.

Playgirl has a four-page fully phallic
foldout which is stunning, although the man
looks about as comfortable as the cougar on
top of the Lincoln-Mercury sign. The lucky
lad who is the “Discovery of the Month"" is
pictured building a house in the nude. His
body looked fine, but an electric saw and
sawdust are not my idea of the most erotic
things in the world. Viva's editor, Bob
Guiccone, declares that ""Viva will be a
woman, my kind of woman,"" and the same trend
continues through all of these male-edited
and produced pornographic magazines for
women. I found myself flipping through a 15
page color erotic version of an Elvira Madi-
gan picnic with the same detached fascination
I used to have when I looked at Playboy; I
wanted to see what kind of body they thought
was sexy and what kind of photography they
thought was erotic. But as far as arousing
my sexual desire in Woolworth's, Playgirl
and friends have a long way to go.

The Pornographic Ultimate

Far more pornographic for women in a cer-
tain sense are the stories in Good House-
keeping, Ladies' Home Journal, and McCall's.

The exact female counterpart to the stereo-
typed ""pulsing virile man beating his way
into the woman and driving her into fits of
ecstasy and sobbing relief"" is to be found
in the sweet stories of dreams at the kitchen
sink as ""petite, blue-eyed Angie watched Jim
come home from the office and remembered
their first date at the beach and how hand-
some he was that Christmas, and how proud
she was to be his girl."" Unfortunately,
little has changed.

Hairdos, diets, recipes, do-it-yourself-
budget-decorating, and unreal fashions that
are guaranteed to make you feel hopelessly
dumpy and unattractive still fill the pages
of all the traditional women's magazines.
Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, and Pat Nixon
are still on the cover, ""The World's Most
Famous Hairdresser (male) Talks About the
World's Most Famous Women"" inside, and one
column on the ""Working Woman"" by Letty
Cottin Pogrebin of Ms. does little to stem
the tide. Women's lib is a curio like yoga,
but husband, children, and home still come
first. The only commendable thing about
these magazines is that they are consistent
and they deliver exactly what they promise.

Fluff Holding at 20%

Ditto for fashion magazines. Ditto for
high school and college magazines for fe-
males. (The New Ingenue still advocates the
virtues of being an ingenue.) Ditto for
needlework and craft magazines which refuse
to respect the craft that they are promoting.
Ditto for bridal magazines. And baby
magazines.

Women's magazines and those with a female
orientation are one of the largest topical
sub-groups of magazines in the country.
Nearly one out of five popular magazines
carried in the Minneapolis Public Library
Branch system are for women. However, with
one exception (Ms.), obviously none are meant
to be taken at all seriously. Certainly
nowhere near 20% of the entries in the
Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature are

from women's magazines.

Halfway House Helps

By Merry Urbia

Shakopee Women Get Just Desserts

Women in our prisons face
many problems today, not
the least of which is that
the general public remains
unaware of female offenders
and the ineffectiveness of
most of the rehabilitation
offered them. A promising
answer to this complicated
situation may be as simple
as P.I. (in this case a Twin
Cities group called Project
Interaction).
Springing from an Indian
culture class led by Dorothy
Anderson and Molly Ramon at
Minn. Women's Correctional
Institute at Shakopee, a
weekly discussion group was
formed which was open to all
inmates. As more volunteers
became interested, an uncen-
sored newsletter was started
to allow inmates feedback
into the community and a bou-
tique opened so women could
wear regular clothes rather
than uniforms. Legal aid, vo-
cational and personal assis-
tance was made available,
and Project Interaction was
incorporated into a nonpro-
fit organization composed of
both inmates and volun-
teers dedicated to the con-
cept of community correction.
Community corrections—not a
term that means much to most
of us not directly involved
with the prison system; but
to the women of Shakopee
prison and those who are hel-
ping them rediscover their
potential through Project
Interaction it can mean sig-
nificant change in their
lives both in and out of the
institution. It means a grass
roots movement that allows
ordinary citizens to provide
much needed, no strings at-
tached help to people in our
prisons, and a chance for in-
mates to develop useful per-
sonal and professional skills
within the community they
face in the future.

One of the most promising
examples of this kind of pro-
gram is Project Interaction's
halfway house for the women
of Shakopee; the only one in
Minnesota, and one of only
nine in the entire country
for women. Although statis-
tical studies in the state
indicate the first ninety
days of re-entry into society
are the most critical for re-
adjustment, most women find
themselves left unprepared
by a correctional system
which has encouraged only
regimentation and alienation
from the community—traits
convenient for prisoners
but not for free functioning
adults. In response to such
a situation, Pi House was
organized with an emphasis
on individual needs and
community interaction.
Operating since January of
1973, at 581 Portland Ave.
in St. Paul, Pi House re-
cently had its open house
to show the community the
results of work by staff,
residents and volunteers
restoring an old three-
story brick house to a cot-
fortable place with a capa-
city of 14 residents.

Through individual and
group counseling, resource
referrals (job, education,
cultural, special treat-
ment) and in-house programs
Pi House deals with three
main areas of concern:
rehabilitation—geared to
positive decision making,
getting residents aware of
their own potential,
individualized program—to
re-establish family-commu-
nity ties and speed tran-
sition back into society,
release—helping people re-
gain personal autonomy, suc-
ceed in establishing inde-
pendence.

Most often these are impli-
mented through a contract
between a resident and Pi
House, specifying personal
commitments and general
rules. Infractions usually
result in loss of privileges
but specific cases are de-
pendent on the judgment of
the counselor assigned. All
residents are required to
attend regular house meet-
ings and report to their
house counselor and parole
officer at scheduled times.
Each resident prepares her
own lunch and breakfast and
is on a rotating schedule
of tasks helping with the
evening meal at which every-
one eats together. Learning
experiences in food prepa-
ration, family planning, bud-
geting and child care are
emphasized within the house,
as a practical consideration
not reinforcement of a fem-
inine stereotyped role. Res-
idents are generally unre-
stricted as to the outside
organizations and groups that
they can take part in, and
may have their children in
for short stays at the house.

It is hoped that the combi-
nation of an individualized
program with a home-like
supportive situation will
result not only in social-
vocational goals but the
development of self-esteem
and personal independence
as well.

Women living at Pi House
are generally young, (the
oldest has been 34), many
have children. To get there
they must be eligible for
parole, go through several
interviews at the prison
and may arrange a pre-
release visit to see if Pi
House is for them.

While the final decision is
up to the parole board,
the halfway house itself
is funded through a State
Crime Commission grant, the
program itself is not organ-
ized by the Minnesota Depart-
ment of Corrections. ""The
Corrections Department
doesn't dictate policy at
Pi House,"" stressed Wanda
Beale, Assistant Director
of the house. Project"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,6,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page006.txt,"Pi House cont.

Interaction, which created  
the program is a non-profit  
group concerned with ""encouraging  
innovative solutions and is  
dependent on private donations  
and community support.

If women living in a sexist  
society face day-to-day problems  
that are hard to overcome, it is  
even harder for those who are  
re-entering it from a prison  
situation. Ms. Beale, who is a  
former head of Minn. Women's  
Political Caucus, feels that the  
rights and problems of women  
inmates are generally overlooked  
by the feminist movement and this  
must change. I agree. It's perhaps  
one of the best examples of how  
standing up for your sisters is  
important for the good of society  
as a whole, as well as for the  
progress of women in society.

If you wish to help, there are  
several areas that need  
volunteers—especially people  
who can escort inmates on trips  
out of Shakopee and offer skills  
or friendship. Fundraisers are  
also welcome; donations of clothing  
for the boutique can be left  
at Pi House.

“We are trying to get things  
to happen in a real way,""  
commented Ms. Beale. But that  
only happens when people reach  
out to people in a real way—not  
just through talk, but action.

High School English Curricula  

Ars Reveal Sexism  

""This is the most exciting  
course I have ever taught,""  
said Martha Harris, an Eng-  
lish teacher at South High in  
Minneapolis. The class is  
called ""Man/Woman."" Its pur-  
pose was to examine male-fe-  
male relationships, roles,  
and attitudes expressed in  
various literary forms. It  
was a sexually mixed class,  
though women outnumbered men  
three to one.  

To promote understanding a-  
mong the students, Harris us-  
ed consciousness-raising exer-  
cises prescribed by the Emma  
Willard Task Force on sexism  
in education. For example,  
she asked the class to com-  
plete the sentence(s), ""I  
would (not) like to be a wo-  
man (man) because..."" This  
exercise revealed that the stu-  
dents held traditional views  
of sexual roles: I would not  
like to be a man because men  
have to be tough and support  
a family, or I would like to  
be a woman because they are  
soft and expressive.  

Another exercise was to com-  
pare derogatory slang words  
for women and men. The list  
for men was noticeably short-  
er. Harris reports that this  
exercise was particularly ef-  
fective. ""The lights went  
on like this!"" she said, ex-  
tending her fingers with a  
snap.  

To begin their study of li-  
terary expression, the stu-  
dents studied song lyrics and  
discussed the attitudes  
found in them. They found a  
lot of negativism about re-  
lationships in the songs.  

As Ms. Harris said, there was  
a lot of ""I can't live with-  
out you"" rather than ""I can  
live without you but it's  
nice to have you here.""  

The class examined myths--  
Greek, Roman, Oriental, and  
Native American. They found  
traditional sexual roles: wo-  
men in the domestic role and  
men in the hunter role.  

They examined contemporary  
short stories, including J.  
D. Salinger's ""Pretty Mouth  
and Green My Eyes,"" Joyce Car-  
ol Oates' ""Where Are You Go-  
ing, Where Have You Been""--and  
found few healthy characters.  
Harris, hating to have every-  
thing seem so negative, intro-  
duced the story, ""X--A Fabu-  

BY JAN JIRAK  

lous Child's Story,"" Ms. Mag-  
azine, December 1972. It is  
a story of a child whose sex  
was concealed. All the stud-  
ents enjoyed reading it but  
insisted that X had to be a  
boy--apparently boys can do  
girl things, but girls can't  
do boy things.  

The class read one novel:  
Temple of God by William Gold-  
man. It is the story of a  
desperately vacuous man who  
exploits a series of desper-  
ately vacuous women. By the  
time they read this book, the  
end of the trimester was imm-  
inent, and their conscious-  
nesses had been raised--they  
""got very angry at the male  
character,"" Harris said.  

The class will be offered  
the rest of this year and  
next year since student inter-  
est is so high, and Harris  
feels the class she taught  
were fairly open to discus-  
sion about women's liberation.  
During a brief discussion on  
the subject, she notes with  
satisfaction, one of the  
young men said, ""That's just  
as much for men, then, too.""  

Communication Skills  

The title of Phebe Hanson's  
class changes daily. The  
Minneapolis Vocational High  
School class' formal name is  
""Woman/Man,"" but ""on alter-  
nate days we call it, 'Man/  
Woman'."" The men had com-  
plained--they felt discrimin-  
ated against.  

Phebe's honest humor peppers  
conversation about the class.  
She says she used Carole King  
's ""You Make Me Feel Like  
a Natural Woman"" and Cat Ste-  
vens' ""Hard Headed Woman"" to  
compare attitudes about women.  
""They (the students) weren't  
as excited about the songs as  
I was--I thought they were  
great.”  

She seems to tap the Univer-  
sal Energy, presenting a mul-  
titude of projects to her  
class. Looking through my  
notes, I find over 15--not  
bad for 12 weeks.  

For example, the class drew  
up lists of good/bad things  
about being a woman/man, put-  
ting the woman lists on a  
blue sheet and the man things  
on a pink sheet. Examples of  
bad things about being a man:  
Having to pay for dates.  

Cops like to pick us up.  

Good things: Not having to  
wear a shirt. Getting intox-  
icated more slowly than women.  
Bad things about being a wom-  
an: Being stared at. Being  
called the weaker sex. Good  
things: Being able to get in-  
to bars at 16 'cause you look 18.  
Being the gentler sex.  

The students wrote essays  
on ""What I Have Learned from  
My Mother/Father about Being  
a Woman/Man."" In some cases,  
this assignment resulted in  
unprecedented communication  
between parents and offspring  
and one father even showed  
his son a love letter he had  
written to his wife during  
their courtship.  

Ms. Hanson used the work  
of photographer Diane Arbus.  
She gave each student a photo  
and asked them to write a  
character sketch for the per-  
son in the photo. At first  
they did not like their char-  
acters, but as they wrote,  
they developed compassion for  
them. The students then sep-  
arated into small groups and  
wrote plays with the charac-  
ters they had developed.  

The students wrote imagin-  
ary letters to Ann Landers,  
describing problems with the  
opposite sex. Exchanging let-  
ters, they answered each oth-  
ers questions, thinking  
through problems and develop-  
ing writing skills at the  
same time.  

The class viewed several  
films, among them one about  
role reversal called Mascu-  
linity/Femininity. Exploring  
the ideas in it, they wrote  
essays on what would happen  
if their parents switched sex-  
ual roles.  

The class learned interview-  
ing skills from the documen-  
tary Growing Up Female. They  
interviewed students in other  
English classes, some went  
downtown to talk to people,  
some looked for certain peo-  
ple, like the elderly, and  
some tried to get a cross sec-  
tion of the population. The  
students also interviewed  
each other. They thought up

sex to get to know them bet-

ter. Ms. Hanson was surprised
to note that as much hustling
originated from the women as
from the men.

Ms. Hanson says she played
down the feminist angle and
never used the words ""women's
liberation"" because she knew
if she did, ""it would never
sell--and I wanted to teach
this class."" She and other
teachers at Vocational do see
some changes in behavior as a
result of her class. A couple
of colleagues have reported
that some of the young men
catch themselves in the mid-
dle of saying ""girl"" and
change it to ""woman.""

Sex and Race

Last year's curriculum at
Central High School in Minne-
apolis featured a class
called “Women's Search."" The
students, all women, explored
the conditions of their woman-
hood.

Counselor Kathy Ertel,
assisted by English teacher
Jordan and teacher's aide Bes-
sie Green, led 3 weeks of com-
munication exercises. In ret-
rospect, the coordinators and
the students agreed that
these exercises were ""absolut-
ely essential"" to establish-
ing trust and opening lines
of communication in the class.

At times the exercises seem-
ed futile. Ms. Ertel said,
“We were very discouraged af-
ter some of the classes.""
Sometimes they worked, and

the students began opening to
each other, but ""by the time
they really got going, the
bell rang."" They met at Ms.
Jordan's home to escape the
bell. A 4-hour ""marathon""
ensued. Ertel asked the stu-
dents to sit in a circle next
to someone they did not feel
comfortable with. One of the
students noted, ""Isn't it in-
teresting that we are sitting
black-white-black-white.""

Race naturally colored all
their discussions, since the
class was half white and half
black. As Ms. Green remarked,
there would be a good discus-
sion going, they would really
be communicating, but “as soon
as race was mentioned, you
could almost see the class
split in two.""

The black women, for exam-
ple, could not understand why
white women minded being put
on a pedestal. Green, who is
black, said, ""I found that a
little hard to understand my-
self.""

Another major topic was fe-
male physiology and sexual ac-
tivity. The women chose speak-
ers to invite to discuss vari-
ous subjects: birth control;
pregnancy; abortion, both pro-
and anti-; rape; homosexuality
and open marriage. A large
number of the students were
sexually active, while some
were not, so a wide spectrum
of experience was available in
the class.

Two male panels, one compos-
ed of teachers and one of stu-
dents at Central, offered the
class their viewpoints. The
coordinators concurred that
the panel of teachers was not
as effective as the panel of
students. Ms. Jordan observed
that they seemed less than can-
did, telling the women what
they thought they should hear.

On the other hand, as one of
the white women remarked, ""I
cannot help it if I am white,
middle-class, Anglo-Saxon...I
felt just a little bit cheated
that we didn't spend equal
time discussing problems of
white women.""

“They were adult men talking
down to teen-age 'girls.'""

She suggested that perhaps the
male teachers were more firmly
entrenched in their roles than
the male students.

When the male student panel
appeared in class, the women
reacted with giggles and ner-
vousness. After the panel
left, the class was very quiet.
One of the coordinators sugges-
ted they talk about the discu-
ssion. One of the students
said, ""Maybe we should talk
about the way we acted so that
next time we can be more real.""

Ms. Jordan said the coordin-
ators had hoped that some mea-
sure of sisterhood would be
established among the women,
""but that was very idealistic.""
Their loyalties are still ra-
cial rather than sexual.

The students did, however,
decide to end the class with a
slumber party. The morning of
the party, one of the students
gave birth to a baby girl.

The class agreed that was a
fitting way to end the course.

Finding the perfect obstetrical care took a lot of shopping around, but for Rebecca and Jose Barreiro of St. Paul, it was worth it. Rebecca explained their search and its fruits.

""I didn't want to have a doctor,"" said Rebecca. “I went to several but they didn't please me. They had an abrupt manner and I didn't feel they cared at all about me. I thought there had to be something else.”

Rebecca learned of Sharon Rising, a nurse midwife who teaches nurse-midwifery at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. Rebecca said the way Rising treated her over the phone was a 100 percent improvement over the doctors she had seen.

""I decided I would go through with it. I'm a foreigner (she's from Cuba) and midwives were common where I came from. I wasn't scared of a midwife, but a lot of my friends said how could you do it? They think of midwifery as really medieval and spooky.""

“I was her patient for four months before the baby was born. I liked the office visits a lot.""

She said they were usually one-half hour to forty-five minutes long.

""Most doctors saw three or four patients in the time she saw me. She was not hurried and said I could call her any time. I didn't call. I'd save all my questions and take my time during the visit.""

Rebecca spent the early part of her labor at home and didn't go to the hospital until her contractions came 30 seconds apart.

""She didn't rush me,"" continued Rebecca. ""I checked with her all day long. I was educated as to the process so I could inform her fairly well about the timing and everything else.""

Rebecca was glad to be home during her early labor. She thinks the bustle and confusion of a hospital would have detracted from the labor. ""The sterility...the uncomfortable bed...the environment is not conducive to a relaxed labor,"" she explained.

When Rebecca, who hates the thought of hospitals, arrived, “it was great. When I was wheeled in, there was Sharon. She stayed with me all the time,"" said Rebecca. And that ""all the time"" amounted to seven more hours.

Like A Family Affair

""I'm a very high control person, I have to know what's happening to my body,"" Rebecca continued. ""I had enough confidence in Sharon that I trusted what she said to me.""

Sharon Rising's constant care had a special advantage for Rebecca. ""I didn't have a whole barrage of nurses I didn't know coming in and out,"" she said.

Rebecca's exceptionally long labor had left her dehydrated and her muscles tense. Sharon decided she needed fluid intravenously and a muscle relaxing injection.

Rebecca didn't want the IV but, ""I accepted it with Sharon, I wouldn't have with a nurse. She used a muscle relaxer that would leave me in control. She took a long time to explain it to me. Some just do, they don't explain. It was such an improvement over what my other American friends have told me.""

""The whole thing was like a family affair. I didn't feel like I was sick. I had the best I could get,"" concluded Rebecca.

Midwifery Delivers Promises

Rebecca's and José's son should have been whisked off to the nursery because his temperature was 1/2 degree below normal. But Sharon let him stay with his new, excited parents to be nursed, photographed and played with for the first time.

Rebecca was ravenously hungry after 27 hours of labor. ""No one eats at 3 a.m.,"" said Rebecca and all she got was toast and water. She fell asleep in the recovery room.

""When I woke up, Sharon was there. The hospital food wasn't enough to satisfy. She helped me a lot,” said Rebecca. ""All the other women were getting shit.""

""Sharon came to see me twice a day,” continued Rebecca. ""Most other women saw their doctors once a day or every other day and had no one to answer questions. Sharon came to visit me twice at home, too.”"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,10,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page010.txt,"After she had been home for several weeks,  
Rebecca was still disappointed about the for-  
ceps delivery.  
""I wondered if by squatting  
or sidelying I could have dislodged the baby  
myself.""  

She and Jose went to Sharon's office with  
their questions and went through the whole  
birth experience step-by-step. They questioned  
each other as to things they could have  
done differently or how they could have mis-  
read the situation.  
After their discussion,  
""I felt tremendously better, this big thing lifted off me.""  

As to Rebecca's impressions of how they  
could have avoided the forceps episode, Re-  
becca said that Sharon wasn't condescending,  
she didn't have the ""how dare you question  
me"" attitude I've gotten from other doctors.  
""We reached conclusions together and that  
made her feel a part of us.  
It was really good.""

next year, but Rebecca plans to return to  
Sharon for the birth of their second child.  

And the doctor with his handy forceps  
didn't recognize Rebecca when she went for  
her five-weeks checkup.  
""He thought I was a new patient.""  

Twin Cities Obstetrics  

With all there is to  
choose from, a woman can either  
find exactly the kind of  
obstetrical care she wants or  
make a lot of mistakes. Here  
are some suggestions for  
choosing wisely.  

1. If you are interested  
in having a midwife attend  
you, there are two nurse-mid-  
wives in the Twin Cities who  
have private practices, Mar-  
garet Hewitt of Hennepin  
County General Hospital and  
Sharon Rising of the Univer-  
sity of Minnesota School of  
Nursing. Sharon has some  
friends who will soon be set-  
ting up practices and either  
woman would know if other  
midwives are available.  

2. The time and establi-  
shment honored ways to locate  
a physician are to call the  
local medical society or med-  
ical school.  

With the Hennepin County  
Medical Society, you are tak-  
ing pot luck. When one of  
the Society's 2,000 physi-  
cians has an opening, the cen-  
tral desk is notified and you  
get the names of three doc-  
tors in your area.  

The AMA advises prospective  
patients to call their  
local university or medical  
school and describe the  
kind of care you want.  

3. The Childbirth Education  
Association (CEA) has de-  
vised a more personal app-  
roach. By calling the CEA  
class registration number, you  
can also obtain a list of doc-  
tors supportive of prepared  
childbirth and couple parti-  
cipation. The doctors are re-  
commended by those who have  
taken a CEA course. You will  
also be given the home phone  
number of a person who reco-  
mmended that doctor. Call,  
chat with a satisfied customer  
and see if their philosophy a-  
grees with yours. Thus, you  
can save yourself the hassle  
and cost of an office visit  
and get a personal view.  

4. The La Leche League  
does the same kind of referral  
in a less extensive, less or-  
ganized way. They can help  
you find a doctor supportive  
of breastfeeding, however.  

5. Call the individual doc-  
tors you are interested in.  
If they don't inspire confi-  
dence or if you disagree with  
their approach, hang up and  
try again.  

6. Referral agencies such  
as Community Line can give you  
names of agencies and hospi-  
tals but make no individual  
recommendations.  

Sister Mary Meyer of St.  
Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul  
recently completed a survey  
of hospitals offering OB ser-  
vice in this area. She found  
that there are 20 hospitals  
with maternity wards opera-  
ting at 40 percent occupancy.  
In order to economize, some  
are combining gynecological  
departments with OB depart-  
ments.  

According to Sister Meyer,  
both kinds of patients are  
not getting the kind of care  
and attention they deserve.  

So be mindful that when  
you choose an obstetrician or  
family doctor or midwife,  
you are also choosing the hos-  
pital he or she practices in.  

Hospitals are competitive,  
consumer facilities--business-  
es. You are the consumer and  
have every right and an obli-  
gation to yourself to ask que-  
stions.  

Feel free to call the mat-  
ernity wards of individual  
hospitals to ask about facili-  
ties. Tour several and com-  
pare them. Remember, you are  
paying them for their serv-  
ices. If you don't like what  
you see, you probably don't  
live far from a hospital more  
to your liking.  

Feel free to question your  
doctor or midwife about hosp-  
ital and personal policy, too.  
Are fathers allowed in the  
delivery room? On whose  
terms--their permission or  
your request? Can you have  
rooming-in (having your baby  
in your hospital room with  
you)?  

You have the right and an  
increasing opportunity to get  
the kind of childbirth care  
you desire. Don't stop look-  
ing until you are satisfied.  
Having a baby isn't a time for  
worry or questions. It is a  
time to celebrate."

“We Want to Help You, Dear”

by Mary Hastings

NOTE TO READERS: The author was, until recently, employed by a Twin Cities firm. In May 1972 she filed
a sex discrimination charge against the corporation with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. Sub-
sequently, she also filed a charge of race and sex discrimination against the corporation with the federal

Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC).

The State Commissioner of Human Rights, in November 1972, returned a decision of ""no probable cause"" to

assume the corporation had discriminated against women.

The author and her attorney appealed that decision

to the State Appeal Board. It overturned the Commissioner's decision and sent the charge back for reinvesti-

gation. The State Department of Human Rights has been in the reinvestigation process since April 1973. At this
writing, the author has received no information from the State concerning the disposition of her charge. (The
EEOC awaits the outcome of the State charge before taking jurisdiction.)

Part I of this series outlined events leading up to the filing of a sex discrimination charge, the filing pro-
cedure and the confrontation of the author and her supervisor after he was served with the charge.

Part II covers the three weeks following this confrontation:

Corporate Persuasion

Sisters, what is happening to you when:

* You take notes at a meeting with male
peers, even though you have the only
Master's Degree in the room, are demon-
strably the most intelligent and are
supposedly equal to the males?

* You attempt to introduce an equitable

- system of housekeeping to your husband,
but clean the toilet, wash the dishes
and carry out the stacks of newspapers
collecting dust in the hall closet, after
you have been subjected to a week-long
silent treatment, accompanied by slamming
doors and crashing pots and pans.

* You are huffily asked if you've read
Henry Steele Commager's history of
American expansionism after you've shot
holes in a man's sophomoric political
vaporings.

You are on a guided tour of the male
arsenal, bristling with weapons to keep an
aberrant woman in her place. In the three
weeks following service of my charge against
the company, I took the first conscious steps
on my year-and-a-half tour of that arsenal.

Two hours after my supervisor acknowledged
my charge, I received a call from the
Vice President of Planning and Administra-
tion, a woman. She asked me if I would meet
her to ""discuss this charge."" I agreed and
met her late that afternoon at a downtown
motel where she and other top management
were in a ""planning session."" I was treated
to dinner on the corporate expense account
and the threat (larded with ""concern"") that
if I did not drop my charge my working life
would be--at best--unpleasant.

I said little, realizing that silence was
my proper state. I discounted much of the
menace underlying her ""sisterly concern.""

I knew that the woman was, unfortunately,
ignorant, with little understanding of the
issues involved in my charge.

Thanks to her, I had a first painful
glimpse of the limitations of sisterhood. I
had hoped--because of our common womanhood--
for an unguarded exchange. But I believe
that anyone involved in a sex discrimination

charge will encounter such untrustworthy wo-
men. They are ""shills,"" to be dealt with as
a man, except for a measure of pity.

I also was introduced to the venality of
the company's top executives. She regaled me
with a sordid account of the personal doings
of her colleagues. She vilified my su-
pervisor and expressed considerable satisfac-
tion that my charge would ""put him in his
place."" I gathered that this outpouring
sprang from her personal frustrations and a
misguided attempt to disarm me.

When we completed our very brief dinner,
she announced that personnel representatives
would contact me in an effort to resolve
this ""misunderstanding.""

As I left the dining room, I noticed four
of her male colleagues at a back table. I
imagined that they already knew their ""stalk-
ing horse"" had failed.

Sinister Silence

When I arrived at work the following morn-
ing, I expected to be the object of whispered
conversations in the cafeteria and stares in
the hallways. Any other bad news traveled
rapidly at the company. Indeed, it seemed
that the prevailing management technique com-
bined general gossip and specific character
assassination. But, oddly, nothing changed in
my co-workers' attitudes toward me. For the"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,12,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page012.txt,"Sex Discrimination, continued

Next week, I expected momentarily to be os-
tracized. This never happened on a wide
scale. Certain selected males were even-
tually told of my heresy. Interestingly,
these men were in positions to adversely
affect my ability to do my job. But news
of my charge was never generally bruited a-
bout. It was the special hope of the com-
pany's personnel people to guard news of my
action from women, who might be emboldened.

A week and a half following my dinner
with Q, the Personnel Director summoned me
to his office. J was a suave, wolf-like
man with iron-tinted hair, black bullet eyes
and a reputation for canniness in ""employee
relations."" I had heard from my male
friends that he was a shouter and desk poun-
der when confronted with problems he could
not smother with unction. Naively, I assum-
ed I would have to face such violence. I
didn't realize that this approach was reser-
ved for males—full-fledged members of hum-
anity. Women could be gotten around with a
minimum of energy.

J introduced me to the most important and
pervasive weapon men use against women—
AUTHORITY.

As I sat opposite his laminated walnut
stain desk, I became 10-year-old Mary again,
a straight-A student who rarely misbehaved
in school but who nonetheless chafed at the
Calvinistic hypocrisy of the teachers—
indeed, who felt secret kinship with a
fourth-grade reprobate named Clarence who
was the object of our teacher's shocking
cruelty because the unfortunate boy didn't
have the ability to stud his report cards
with A's and to confine his rebellion to the
perimeters of his mind.

J, of course, knew nothing of Clarence and
10-year-old Mary. Before him sat a strange,
""wrong-headed"" woman who needed setting
straight.

""I wish you had come to us first,"" he de-
clared. ""I'm sure we could settle this mis-
understanding within the company, without a
formal, legalistic structure.""

J hoped I would seriously consider drop-
ping the charge and ""working with the Per-
sonnel Department to correct any misunder-
standing.""

He had been in touch with the State Depart-
ment of Human Rights. He had vast experi-
ence in minority employee problems. He was
a friend of the State Commissioner of Hum-
an Rights. These credentials presented, J
launched a monologue about his daughters,
who were track stars, and could compete as
fiercely as any man. Women were, naturally,
equal to men. (I privately wondered if he
felt the appropriate female costume to be a
brass-buttoned jacket and tin cup.)

All a Misunderstanding

While the edge of my mind accompanied J's
daughters around the race track, the core of
my thoughts rested on the mildly ominous word
""misunderstanding."" Q had also used it. I
had anticipated many unpleasant consequences
of filing the charge. But I had expected
the company to defend itself against that
charge of sex discrimination. It devolved
upon Q, and especially J, to point out that
there had been no discrimination, only ""mis-
understanding.""

There is nothing so characteristic of late
20th century Americans as their practice of
denying a problem, a crime, a wart on a
backside. And since America is male, I
should not have been surprised to discover
that my problem with my employer lay in faulty
understanding, not oppression.

I hope you will agree to meet with

I was drawn from my sociological rumina-
tions to J's conciliatory smile.
""Of course,"" I responded guiltily. Guilt?
Why that? Because of that female burden, I
made the error of ever seriously countenan-
cing the company's empty blandishments. But
I had been raised to strive toward honesty
and empathy with my fellows. I should have
approached the Pandora's Box of conciliation
more cautiously. (See box, page <p)

J relaxed as he read the familiar signs
of female hesitation and guilt at creating
""obstacles and unpleasantness.""

As far as I was concerned, our meeting
was over. (Although yet afflicted with many
""female weaknesses,"" I had already allowed
my naturally strong personality to assert
itself by terminating meetings when I chose,
rather than awaiting dismissal from the pa-
triarch/male.) Accordingly, I arose, in-
formed J I would contact the State Investi-
gator on my case about a ""conciliation meet-
ing"" and left.

On returning to my office I called the
State Investigator and we settled on a meet-
ing date two weeks distant.

I then had 14 days to analyze my situa-
tion. As the gears of American due process
missed and meshed, I became aware of a pat-
tern forming in my relationship with the com-
pany:"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,13,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page013.txt,"Discrimination, continued

@Personnel and top management would keep my action quiet and I would abet them because of a personal dislike of notoriety.

@I would not be dramatically dismissed, as I had thought. (Nothing so clean or kind lay in store for me.)

®The company would attempt to appease me in the initial phase of dealing with my charge.

@The company would try to wear me down. Less than a month had passed since I filed the charge, and already I was tired. Now I realized that my anticipation of confrontation and resolution was illusory. I still only dimly perceived, however, the difficulty of watching my every word and act, of performing my job satisfactorily and of somehow finding the mental and emotional reserves to withstand the company's onslaught.

This pattern would undergo some significant modifications in what I think of as ""Phase II and III"" of the prosecution of my charge, but the basic pattern—set less than one month after I filed—remained in force until I quit my job two months ago.

The Art of Conciliation--- or What Every Trojan Should Know About Greeks

If you file a sex discrimination charge against your employer in Minnesota, you are required to partake of ""conciliation"" if the respondent (your employer) so wishes. Thus, you should be prepared to abide by the law, but always remember that a sincere employer is as rare as a rich man in heaven.

Your employer will be ever so eager to have you drop the charge so that you and the company can ""work together"" to clear up the ""misunderstanding."" Never, never drop your charge. You will have wasted all the pain and energy it cost you to file. And your employer will simply wear you down until you quit or, in a few months, a plausible reason will be found to fire you.

As I noted in Part I of this series, it is best to retain an attorney before you ever file a charge. But certainly, if you are approaching ""conciliation"" and do not have legal counsel, hesitate no longer. Do not go into conciliation meetings without prior advice from an attorney.

Be sure to limit your employer's ""conciliation"" attempts. Do not allow it to postpone action with sharp maneuvers.

Your employer will, of course, make fulsome promises. In my case, the only concrete result of conciliation was an inadequate salary adjustment. (See details of my first conciliation meeting in Part III of this series next month.) My salary was adjusted back several months—NOT to my starting date. Thus, I could not claim my employer had admitted that I was treated unfairly at the outset.

All other promises revolved around my completing ""career counseling"" and ""job clarification"" with my supervisor. It is interesting to note that, once again, the female was assumed to be lacking in some way. I was forced into these ridiculous exercises, even though I was the aggrieved party. This ""turning the tables"" on women is the second important weapon men have.

I spent many hours listing my job functions, categorizing them on 3 x 5 note cards and assigning a mysterious ""A, B or C"" authority rating to each task. These exercises were a burden on me and detracted from the time I could spend doing my job. Meanwhile, my employer was hiding in the blizzard of note cards, thoughtfully planning its next step.

(The company's enthusiasm for making me happy in my work declined precipitously when they realized I would not drop the charge.)

You should understand that while your employer is tiring you out with countless interviews and heaping insulting ""concern"" on you over your “unhappiness” with your job, it is busily marshalling its defenses. And they are impressive.

Your employer has unlimited money. (Relatively speaking)

Your employer either has its own legal staff or the ability to retain legal experts.

Your employer has reams of statistics that can be molded like hot gold to present an innocent face.

@YOUR EMPLOYER HAS RESPECTABILITY.

And you have:

™ the right to retain an attorney. Do so, for your peace of mind and the proper prosecution of your charge.

Your employer's fear of publicity. I could not exploit this, because of personal squeamishness. But carefully consider the value of this fear. I think that group actions might be particularly aided by public exposure of your employer. (Your employer will, of course, find your perverted love of publicity morally repugnant.)

Female Co-workers. Supposedly ""non-feminist"" women can be extremely supportive of a woman involved in a sex discrimination charge. I made the mistake of hiding my action from most of my female colleagues. Although it is not advisable to aggressively proselytize ""non-political"" women, it is wise to tell them about your action and how it can affect them."

SELF PORTRAIT BY JOAN JOHNSTONE

Hand-tinted photographs reminiscent of
early 20th century postcards are featured
in an exhibition on view through December
30 at the upstairs gallery of the Afro-
American Cultural Arts Center, 24 S. 31st
Street, Minneapolis.

The photographs are the work of a young
woman artist, Joan Johnstone, whose work
has been seen before in University exhibi-
tions and who worked as a portfolio artist
with Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in New
York before returning to Minneapolis early
this year.

The technique is an original one, invented
by Johnstone through experimental attempts
to reproduce the delicate colors of the old
postcards she collects. Working on matte
paper, she creates smooth surfaces with oil
color, brilliant highlights with water dyes.

Johnstone points out that her work, al-
though experimental, is an enlargement of
traditional photographic techniques and
is not done merely for the sake of exper-
imentation. ""My technique modifies the
black-and-white photograph, and gives it
more impact,"" Johnstone says. The photo-
graphs are painted in a careful process
that may take up to ten hours.

Review

‘Vita, Violet

by Susan Cushman

My acquaintance with Vita Sackville-West
has been a gradual and increasingly pleasant
experience. I first noticed her while read-
ing about Virginia Woolf; Vita was a writer-
ly friend who lagged somewhat behind Virgin-
ia's literary tastes, yet thoroughly satis-
fied her as a companion. Virginia wrote, ""I
like her and being with her and the splen-
dour...There is her maturity and full breast-
edness; her being so much in full sail on
the high tides, where I am coasting down
backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the
floor in any country...her being in short
(what I have never been) a real woman. Then
there is some voluptuousness about her; the
grapes are ripe; and not reflective.""

Virginia expressed her liking for Vita
more fully in Orlando, a rambunctious, gal-
lant novel about a hearty human being whose
life spanned several centuries and encompas-
sed an abrupt and final sex change. The
book was dedicated to Vita and contained
some curious photographs of her.

Orlando was perhaps the first positive
public commemoration of a tumultuous, sexual-
ly ambivalent period in Vita's life. The
second public recognition has come in the
recently published Portrait of a Marriage
(Atheneum, 249 pages, $10) by Nigel Nicolson,
Vita's youngest son.

The book has five sections - two by Vita
and three by Nicolson. Vita's are autobio-
graphical, written when she was 28, married,
and dramatically involved in a love affair
with another woman - Violet Trefusis. She
begins with her aristocratic heritage, pas-
ses through her apparently unhappy child-
hood, and finally concentrates on the con-
flict which arose when she could not deci-
sively choose between Violet and her husband,
diplomat Harold Nicolson. Her account gains
momentum as she catches up to events in the
final entries, which take on the immediacy
of a diary.

“An Absurd Circumstance”

Nicolson's portions serve as commentary
and contextual filler, as he attempts to
place Vita's incomplete autobiography with-
in the framework of her entire life.

Vita had been married to Harold Nicolson
for five years when she was reunited with
Violet, a childhood friend, in a suddenly
erotic relationship. It was not Vita's
first homosexual involvement; prior to her
marriage she had been offhandedly conducting
an affair with Rosamund, another childhood
friend. Because she had not been seriously
taken with Rosamund, whom she quite brutally
shucked off after her wedding, Vita evident-
ly considered sexual love between women a
frivolous, easily controlled hobby.

But her love for Violet was powered by an
irresistible impetus, for with Violet, Vita
became a new, strangely exuberant person.
Two years after the affair had begun in
earnest, she wrote: ""An absurd circumstance
gave rise to the whole thing; I had just got
clothes like the women-on-the-land were wear-
ing, and in the unaccustomed freedom of
breeches and gaiters I went into wild
spirits; I ran, I shouted, I jumped, I climbed,
I vaulted over gates, I felt like a

& Harold

schoolboy let out on a holiday; and Violet
followed me across fields and woods with a
new meekness, saying very little, but never
taking her eyes off me...it was simply the
drunkenness of liberation - the liberation
of half my personality. She opened up to me
a new sphere.”

After the sphere had lost its newness, it
became infinitely complicated. Violet and
Vita spent a passionate summer together,
going off on small trips whenever they could.
In late fall, they left for France with
plans to return to England before Christmas.
But in Paris, Vita took advantage of a newly
discovered excitement.

The Boy Julian

""I dressed as a boy. It was easy, because
I could put a khaki bandage round my head,
which in those days was so common that it
attracted no attention at all. I browned my
face and hands...My height of course was my
great advantage. I looked like a rather un-
tidy young man, a sort of undergraduate, of
about nineteen...Violet used to call me
Julian. We dined together every evening in
cafes and restaurants, and went to all the
theatres. I shall never forget the evenings
when we walked back slowly to our flat
through the streets of Paris. I, personally
had never felt so free in my life. Perhaps
we have never been so happy since.""

The two lovers did not return at Christ-
mas. By the time Vita and Violet meandered
into London at the end of March, the ""scan-
dal"" had become semi-public and Vita was ur-
ged to give Violet up to an impending mar-
riage of her own.

Violet wanted to make a complete break and
live with Vita in unhampered female freedom.
Vita vacillated. Then Violet married, pro-
bably in an attempt to stir Vita into jeal-
ous action. The two rejected husbands con-
ducted a united campaign in their efforts to
separate their wives. In the end, after
chases back and forth across Europe, the hus-
bands were triumphant and the women parted
in the spring of 1920. Their affair had
lasted three years.

Soon after Vita's death in 1962, Nigel Ni-
colson found her short, handwritten autobio-
graphy locked away in her writing room. He
waited until his father also died, and then
a few years more, ten in all, before bring-
ing the manuscript to light. Apparently, he
feared that readers would condemn Vita and
disregard the eventually stable and long-
lasting marriage between his mother and

father. As the title indicates, his commen-
tary in Portrait of a Marriage reduces the
affair with Violet to an episode within a
larger, insulating framework.
Harold Nicolson, also a homosexual,
did not begrudge Vita an extramarital es-
cape for he conducted some himself. But he
was not prepared to let them permanently inter-
fere with the continuum of his life with Vita.
Though Vita had much the same attitude,
the intensity of her relationship with Vio-
let took her by surprise. She wrote to
Nigel in 1960:
""When we married, you were older than I
was, and far better informed. I was very"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,18,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page018.txt,"young, and very innocent. I knew nothing  
about homosexuality. I didn't even know  
that such a thing existed either between men  
or between women. You should have told me.  
You should have warned me. You should have  
told me about yourself and warned me that  
the same sort of thing was likely to happen  
to myself. It would have saved us a lot of  
trouble and misunderstanding. But I simply  
didn't know.”

What Vita didn't know, or Harold either,  

I think, was that sexual love of any sort  
could be an overwhelming, sustained exper-  
ience. While they had been sexually inter-  
ested in each other at the beginning of their  
marriage, this facet of their relationship,  
which was probably never too enthusiastic,  
was eliminated after the birth of their  
second son. Harold's involvements with men  
were brief and inconsequential. No doubt he  
assumed that Vita's would be the same; and  
once her ardor for Violet had been stilled,  
Vita did in fact conduct subsequent affairs  
lightheartedly.

Portrait of a Marriage is both provocative  
and unyielding. Vita's account was written  
during an emotionally turbulent time, when  
she believed that her life was ""a morass...  
a bog, a swamp, a deceitful country” and her  
writing seems hurried and incomplete. She  
began the story because she wanted to tell  
the truth about a habitually secret sort of  
relationship and ""because I hold the convic-  
tion that as centuries go on, and the sexes  
become more nearly merged...such connections  
will to a very large extent cease to be re-  
garded as merely unnatural, and will be un-  
derstood far better...I believe that then  

the psychology of people like myself will be  
a matter of interest, and I believe it will  
be recognized that many more people of my  
type do exist than under the present-day  
system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted.""

Vita went on to say that even if homosex-  
uality is an “evil” it should be treated  
with candor. Her ambivalence toward homo-  
sexuality was never resolved.

Sympathy, Neutrality & Flatness  

In his chapters, Nicolson alternates be-  
tween sympathy and neutrality toward his  
mother's private life. However, his collec-  
tion of surrounding facts, while no doubt  
carefully gathered, serve to flatten, rather  
than illuminate Vita's recollection. Be-  
tween the two of them, Violet remains a  
shadowy figure and the sequence of events an  
undeciphered jumble. Still, the book is a  
breakthrough of sorts, since the very pri-  
vate lives of famous people are not often  
revealed when homosexuality is a significant  
factor. Portrait of a Marriage would have  
been a more satisfying book, however, if  
Nicolson had not been so concerned with the  
reticent dictates of ""good taste.""

Vita's best writing describes her exuber-  
ant transformation into “Julian."" The  
switch had cultural, as well as sexual, con-  
notations. Vita wrote: ""I never appreciated  
anything so much as living like that with  
my tongue perpetually in my cheek, and in  
defiance of every policeman I passed.""

Nigel Nicolson assumed that Vita was re-  
lieved to have emerged from the Violet/Ju-  
lian period to settle down to a calmer 40  
years as Harold's definite wife. I wonder  
about that, particularly when I read Vir-  
ginia Woolf's knowing passage in Orlando  
where she describes a change from male to  
female. Orlando is sailing for England and  
ponders the thing that has taken place.

""{It is a strange fact, but a true one that  
up to this moment she had scarcely given her  
sex a thought...it was not until she felt  

“These skirts are plaguey things”  

the coil of skirts about her legs and the  
Captain offered, with the greatest polite-  
ness, to have an awning for her on deck that  
she realised, with a start, the penalties and  
the privileges of her position...""Lord,"" she  
thought, when she had recovered from her  
start...""this is a pleasant, lazy way of  
life, to be sure. But,"" she thought, giving  
her legs a kick, “these skirts are plaguey  
things to have about one's heels""...Here  

she tossed her foot impatiently, and showed  
an inch or two of calf. A sailor on the  
mast, who happened to look down at the moment  
started so violently that he missed his foot-  
ing and only saved himself by the skin of  
his teeth. ""If the sight of my ankles means  
death to an honest fellow who, no doubt, has  
a wife and family to support, I must, in all  
humanity, keep them covered,"" Orlando  
thought...""A pox on them!"" she said, realis-  
ing for the first time, what, in other cir-  
cumstances she would have been taught as a  
child, that is to say, the sacred responsi-  
bilities of womanhood...""All I can do, once  
I set foot on English soil, is to pour out  
tea and ask my lords how they like it. D'you  
take sugar? D'you take cream?"" And mincing  
out the words, she was horrified to perceive  
how low an opinion she was forming of the  
other sex, the manly, to which it had once  
been her pride to belong.""

Orlando the man into Orlando the woman,  
Julian back into Vita, and I somehow see  
this passage Virginia Woolf wrote for Vita  
Sackville-West as one of the finer tributes  
one woman has ever paid another.

by Dianna Hunter

I've been thinking a lot lately about how I,  
a lesbian woman, can love women who choose  
to live with and love men. By this I mean  
both the so-called ""straight"" woman whose  
most intimate energies go into men and the  
so-called “bisexual” woman whose most inti-  
mate energies may also go into women.

It's been about two and a half years since  
I realized I was a lesbian and came out in  
my consciousness-raising group. And now  
I've had about two and a half years of  
problems in dealing with ""bisexual"" and  
""straight"" women.

When I came out, I was living with four other  
women. We had gotten together by chance  

to rent a professor's house, which turned  

out to be the perfect setting for my coming  
out. Two of the other women and I were  
involved in feminist consciousness-raising  
groups. We talked about women, sexism,  
sexuality, lesbianism, and other feminist  
issues at length, both inside and outside  

the groups. For me, this was a major part  

of all that I learned from those women. I  
also learned about cooking, painting, weav-  
ing, and pottery. I felt this time was a  
vibrant time, a time pregnant with personal  
growth. The feminist ideas, my relationships  
with the women of my house and with one  

other close friend, my friends' work in  

the arts—all these influences moved me to  
realize the deep love I had for other women.

I was coming out slowly, learning new ways  
that I could touch women with my body, my  
feelings, and my ideas—in other words, with  
my intimate self. I was loving this inti-  
macy, and wanting more. I guess the point  
at which I decided I was a lesbian was when  
I realized I wanted to make love to other  
women, not just hug them hello and goodbye  
or catch a quick pat on the back. At that  
time I felt defenses going up between me as  
lesbian and them as straight. I sensed a  
definite limit in how much they would give  
to me. Because I loved them, I wanted to  
sleep with them. They loved me but did not  
want to lead me on or give me any false im-  
pressions of their affection for me. They  
did not want to sleep with me. I began to  
feel one major difference standing between  
them and me: They wanted to sleep with men;  
I wanted to sleep with women. This dif-  
ference gave each of us her label. I became  
""lesbian."" They became ""straight women.""

Women have asked me, ""Don't you want to get  
rid of labels?"" Yes, of course I do. But  
first I want to get rid of the things that  
cause us to use labels. For now, “lesbian""  
and ""straight woman"" have meaning to me.  
With a lesbian, I feel our love for one anoth-  
er could advance to any level. This is not  

to say that love between lesbians is perfect,  

always advancing on to higher and higher  
levels, both women desiring the same love  
experiences. It does mean that with each  
lesbian I meet, there is a chance that we  
may make love. I know that I cannot sleep  
with a straight woman. Consequently, I  
have felt that I could not put much energy  
into a relationship with a straight woman.  
Whatever ways we found to love one another  
would be blocked at a level which I have  
found fulfilling. Joni Mitchell wrote,  
""making love is touching souls."" I was  

afraid I would fall in love with a straight  
woman, and we would not be able to touch  
souls.

I envision a world where there will be no  
labels ""straight woman"" or ""lesbian."" There  
we will relate on all levels that feel right,  
at the time that they feel right. We will  
touch souls if you and I both desire it. I  
will be true to myself. I will do the things  
that I want to do. You will also act as you  
truly wish. We will be honest with one  
another about which ways we want our relation-  
ship to grow. When we stop growing together,  
we will part without fear, still loving and  
respecting one another. For now, though, I  
do see fears in the way of our loving one  
another. I want to identify my own fears of  
straight women (By this term I also mean  
bisexual women.), so I can work through the  
fears. I think identifying them will help  
begin the process of eliminating them.

When talking to straight women, I feel fear,  
in both myself and them, associated with  
the question of men. I am a member of the  
Twin City Women Poets. Recently, in that  
group, we hassled because another lesbian  
and I wanted the group to sponsor a woman-  
centered poetry reading. By this we meant  
the poems would be about women, and only  
women could attend. The straight women  
poets said they would accept the idea of  
reading poems about women. But they would  
not accept keeping men out of the reading.  
I do not want to relate to men. I do not  
wish to read my poetry to men. I don't  
wish to deny other women the option of re-  
lating to men, but I want straight women to  
recognize my need not to deal with men.

As soon as the argument over the woman-cen-  
tered reading began, I felt my defenses  

go up against the straight woman poets.

Just to know that a woman has a man in her  
heart frightens me. I have tried to carry  
on sexual relationships with two women who  
considered themselves bisexual, and in both  
cases, I felt very threatened by the other  
woman's relationships with men.

The first woman and I knew one another for  
about six months before we made love. We  
had kissed a lot one night at the bar, and  
she had invited me home and then decided  
that she didn't want to make love with me  
because of a relationship she was having  
with a man. After we did finally consum-  
mate our relationship, we spent approxi-  
mately another six months of being friends  
and lovers, sometimes sleeping together and  
sometimes not. I felt that I was in a more  
vulnerable position than she because I saw  
myself as a lesbian. I was stuck there, as  
a lover of women, loving her in particular.  
She was free to abandon her lesbianism, and  
me, and to go on relating to men. She was  

never very comfortable thinking of herself as  
a lesbian, anyway. She once told me that  

she formed her closer and more honest re-  
lationships with women, but that she just  
liked sleeping with men.

The other straight woman whom I really cared  
for never was my lover. We talked a lot,  
kissed and hugged, fondled, and slept to-  

gether. But we never made love. She was  

continued on next page"
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,20,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page020.txt,"feeling that she might be a lesbian. She  
said how beautiful women are. She talked  
about experiencing sensuality in what she  
thought would be a woman's way—not per-  
forming pre-established acts, but exploring  
sensations, textures, tastes. I learned a  
lot from this friend, and I would like to  
know her better. I hope our relationship  
can one day grow so that we can touch and  
give to each other on new levels. But for  
now, it has stopped growing. We do not  
even see each other as friends, only at  
meetings. I feel that the sexual pressure  
ruined our relationship. She was wondering  
whether she should sleep with me, while I  
wondered whether I would sleep with her. I  
was frustrated by not being able to show  
her, physically, my feelings for her. And  
she was not able, or ready, to consider  
herself a lesbian.  

One thing I've learned is that making love  
is not possible with all lesbians, not even  
with every lesbian that I care about. Each  
friendship seems to have a different physi-  
cal level. With some lesbian friends I  
barely touch. We hug hello and goodbye,  
and kiss on the cheek, or quickly on the  
lips. With other friends, I can walk hand-  
in-hand, rub noses, rock in one another's  
arms, and sleep face-to-face, embracing.  

I love each woman on a unique level, and I  
am learning to express my love for each  
woman in a unique and appropriate way. For  
one thing, I am learning that ""sleeping  
with"" doesn't necessarily mean ""making  
love."" And neither does kissing, fondling,  
or loving glances necessarily mean that I  
want genital sex from the relationship.  

I was so happy after the last women poets'  
meeting when an old friend and I cuddled.  

I hadn't seen her for a long time. I was  
glad to see her. I was loving her. And  

I felt like being hugged, so I sat on her  
lap. She put her arms around me. We  
rocked, and patted, and fondled, and talked  
for a while. I have been touching my lesbian  
friends in that way, but this was the first  
time I had had such a positive and easy phys-  
ical experience with a straight woman.  
Usually I feel unsatisfied by the physical  
affection straight women show me. It often  

comes as a quick pat, halting, and with the  
hand quickly jerked away. No lingering  
touches. I like to be warmed by being  
touched. I like to warm other women by  
touching them. And the part of touching  
that seems to warm me best is the lingering  
kind of touch, a touch that conveys a feel-  
ing of comfort and acceptance. I hope that  
straight women and lesbians will learn to  
touch one another warmly, and without fear  
of what that touching means.  

Such open relationships will take hard work.  
We are going to have to be honest with one  
another, and talk to one another a lot about  
our different lifestyles. For me, it is  
difficult to understand the reality of a  

straight woman's life. I can't really pic-  
ture what she feels as she relates to men.  
I don't know what kind of changes or growth  
she expects to experience with men.  

Married women, family women, women living  
with men and doing the housekeeping, even  
women living with men and working to improve  
the relationship between men and women,  

all these are lifestyles which are foreign  
to my experience. Since I left my parents'  
home in 1967, I have shared a home with a  
man only once, for three months, more than  
two years ago. Since then, my closer  
friends and my roommates have all been  
lesbians.  

To straight women my experience is foreign.  
When I told the Twin City Women Poets that  
I was living in a women's culture, one  
woman said, ""but that's not reality."" We  
each have our own reality. Part of me  

goes to work forty hours a week at an alien-  
ating job. Part of me pays rent to a male  
landlord. Part of me spends money at  
capitalist food stores when I don't feel  
like walking six blocks to a food co-op.  
But there is a large part of me that works  
as fast as I can to learn about women.  

That means to learn about myself, too. It  
means looking for my roots in the history  
of the Matriarchy. Woman-centered cultures.  
Goddesses. Witches. Herbalists. Midwives.  
Hecate. Artemis. Diana. Athena. Joan  

of Arc. Amelia Earhart. Wonder Woman.  
Billy Jean King. All of our past and  

Our strength  
that never has been completely buried,  

that was here all along. I want to be  
strong, and I want to be able to give  
strength to other women.  

I see our strength building. I spent  
Thanksgiving on a farm in Wisconsin. Four  
women friends of mine live there, and two  
children friends. The women are raising  
the children, seven horses, chickens, ducks,  
three dogs, two cats, bees, and one another.  
They have cut a pile of wood bigger than  
their house. They eat their own bees'  

honey and use the beeswax in a salve for  
their horses' hooves. As for dreams, one  
of the finest I've known was a reality:  
White Mare galloping across a crisp, frosty  
field with Marea astride. The horse is all  
white, muscled, the most spirited of all  
their horses. Only Marea can handle her  
riding bareback. Marea's hair and White  
Mare's magnificent tail were flying behind  
as they galloped. Marea looked serious,  
resolute, not at all frightened. I thought  
of Joan of Arc. Heroines. A dream living.  

There are lots of women's farms. I have  
heard of them in Washington, Oregon, Cal-  
ifornia, Colorado, Arkansas, and Minnesota.  
I see women learning to become self-suffi-  
cient for food and energy. I see this  
learning as a reality which will help bring  
about the larger reality of a woman's cul-  
ture. I see dreams growing in the city,  
too. The Lesbian Resource Center, Twin  
City Women Poets, Goldflower, So's Your Old  
Lady, the Elizabeth Blackwell women’s health  
clinic, Women's Counseling Service, the  
food co-ops, and the North Country dry  
goods store have all grown from the dreams  
of women.  

A good thing that happened recently at a  
women poets’ meeting was one woman saying  
we need to write more about our hopes and  
accomplishments, and less about our trouble  
and shortcomings. I agree. I think we  
will truly begin to love and energize one  
another when we start giving other women  
our dreams. Goodbye to Sylvia Plath. I  
don't want to listen to her madness any  
more. And as for Virginia Woolf in the  
river, I'd like to see her come wading back  

out, unburdening herself of stones by throw-  
ing them at her oppressors. I don't want  

to think about her sinking. I won't give  

in to madness or suicide, as long as there  
are women to love me, touch me, and feed me  
dreams."

Louise Nevelson has been a working artist  
for 53 years. For three decades, although  
she produced work in a variety of media, she  
never made a sale. During those years she  
was ignored and sometimes treated with out-  
right hostility by what she calls the ""art  
Mafia.""

Now art critics are calling her the greatest  
living American sculptor. Despite her hard  
won fame and wealth, Nevelson remains a warm,  
gracious person. There is no pretense about  
her. She speaks openly about her commitment  
to feminism on a global and personal scale.

Nevelson has faced many difficult situations  
in her life, but her marriage and her aff-  
iliation with the Sidney Janis Gallery rank  
in her mind as the most destructive.

She was the first woman and the first Amer-  
ican sculptor ever shown by New York's pres-  
tigious Janis Gallery in the early sixties.  
She constructed three huge walls to be shown  
by Janis. The show was well received, but  
none of the pieces were sold. In debt to  
Janis for $20,000, she had to sell her  
studio-home in order to raise the money.

In the meantime, Janis held her works as  
collateral.

She succeeded in ransoming the wooden hos-  
tages, but the experience took a tremen-  
dous mental and physical toll. Years earl-  
ier she had been able to claim her total  
being by breaking up her marriage to con-  
centrate fully on her art.

The capacity to free herself from domination  
has played a crucial role in developing her  
individual and artistic consciousness. She  
and her work become stronger and more beau-  
tiful with age.

QUESTIONS and ANSWERS

Q: How have you escaped or redefined the role  
society creates for women?

A: For thousands of years, way back in the  
Bible, men controlled the universe. We speak  
about—and I do too, I forget and speak  
about—he, the he. God is he and right from  
God down and before God there was he. So  
naturally where there's the greater power  
you're going to have the rest subservient to  
it.

But I think some people are born with a feel-  
ing of independence; that they belong to them-  
selves. And then there's a conflict, because  
if you belong to yourself when you step out  
over the threshold into the so-called world,  
you're hit back. You're smacked this way,  
you're smacked that way, because you're not  
in the dominant position.

At this point, there are women in the high-  
est positions. They're given their jobs by  
men; say, even politically. Now you know I  
can't stand that president—that isn't it.  
But the president has given positions to wo-  
men. Of course those women he selected are  
worshipers of him. They support him. So  
those women, whom we would expect to be em-  
ancipated and help humanity just turn right  
around and are slaves again. In principle,  
if you are a lowly slave or a high-class  
slave, you're still in the process of being  
a slave. You see?

I think in our time, through awareness, the  
schools and education things are changing.  
No matter whether you accept or reject the  

conventional education, it does something.

It opens. I don't say it opens all areas,  
but it does enlighten you somewhere. So why  
would anyone expect women that go to our best  
schools to go into the kitchen and be satis-  
fied? It's utterly ridiculous.

If you are trained and you're equipped to be  
a great opera star, you're not going to give  
that up, because you like to sing and work  
at it and that's your life. You're not go-  
ing in the kitchen. So we have many more  
trained women and the sum total of the pool-  
ing of the consciousness of the awareness of  
all these things—not only in America, but  
the world over—causes them to awaken. I  
don't think it's easy, but there are some  
good heads that are battling and I'm very  
optimistic that it will change. It's grow-  
ing into it, it's bound to.

Now we had women's suffrage, we had other  
things, but never was there a group that saw  
it through. And even now there's a bit of a  
lull from a few years back. But it's es-  
tablished and we can all look forward to it  
being part of our way of life.

Don't forget that when there's a master and  
a slave, the master is also enslaved. So  
men will never be emancipated until they  
accept that every human being is a human be-  
ing and not be caught in just one part of  

the body.

Q: But you were not saying these things, but  
at least thinking them many, many years ago.

A: Well, I took them.  
I didn't think them. I had to take them for  
what I wanted to do. I knew I was gifted.  
Now you see we're taught to be modest and to  
be ladylike. Well, that's deadly. And es-  
pecially if you have this thing that I wanted  
so badly. And not only that, that's the way  
I wanted to live. And I didn't want to be  
hemmed in by anybody. I don't think the  
world's that big. So I just had to break, if  
you call it traditions, but I didn't even con-  
sider them. I just did.

I didn't say them and

Q: Was the price you paid to break out worth  
it?

A: I needed to claim my total being. That  
means time, thought, you know, it means that I  
wanted to be in control of myself. So that  
I'd be free to live my life as I could under-  
stand it.

Q: Well, you paid some kind of price for that.

A: Of course, you pay, but you see, darling,  
if you don't do that you pay a price that's  
probably more. I was married, I was  
getting abscesses and boils. The blood  

boils just like on a stove and you get these  
things. I got sciatica and I was crippled.

I left, I was miserable, and I went to Eur-  
ope to study and just crossing the ocean and  
having the lid taken off my head, they dis-  
appeared. But what would have happened if  

I was confined?

Now, when I say confined, it was a time of  
affluence and nice surroundings. So, there's  
something about us, that demands what we are.  
And it doesn't really matter so much our  
surroundings in a case like that, an extreme  
case. Because I knew my capacity I was itching  
all over because I was bottled up.

Q: So in other words, the price you would  
have paid by not doing it would have been  
worse.  

A: I would have committed suicide. I would  
have cut my throat. And I would have wished  
the throat was a little bigger so I could  

cut it more.  

Q: What role does anger as a catalyst play  
in your work?  

A: I feel in retrospect that anger was very im-  
portant in my development. I used anger for  
my unfolding to the place I am. Yes. I  
don't dismiss it. I also think—now don't  
say that I said I was a drunkard—but I used  
alcohol in a medical way. Because when I  
was psychically so fatigued I found that I  
would never dismiss what liquor did for me.  

Now I don't say that I was alcoholic, but I  
think that it helped me. It was like if I  
was in a high spot and I wanted to really  
jump out of the window, then you land on a  
rope and then you don't touch bottom. Well,  
alcohol was able to do that for me. You see  
there were not as many pills, or I didn't  
know about them. Now we know in recent years  
about chemistry. Say people that go off.  
They give them things and they find it’s an  
imbalance in chemistry in the body.  

Maybe when you think and work as I did—I  
depleted the body. Now I would probably go  
to a doctor and get a shot. Or I would go  
to a doctor that would give me these things  
that would quiet me. But at that time I  
don't think it existed and so I did it an-  
other way, maybe a more primitive way.  

Q: If you were angry about something, would  
that help you to work or drive you to work?  

A: I think it did. You see your glands are  
very stimulated and you're in a pitch where,  
yes, you have to work it off. Some people,  
like in the country, would probably chop  
wood in order to relax. But I did it my way  
which included a great deal of physical  
labor. No one has said it to my knowledge,  
but I maintain that there's great intellect  
in physical labor. I'm sure that I learned  
a great deal out of physical labor in my  
work. I would not dismiss it.  

In our times in sculpture we can make a  
little drawing or a little cardboard ma-  
quette and then it is blown up in a foundry.  
Now, I do my work myself to a great degree  
because I like it and I identify with it.  
It's very living for me; I live with it.  

And having studied modern dance, when I move  
with it the rhythms and all of that plays a  
very important part in my consciousness.  
That for me is living.  

Q: Do you still dance at all?  

A: Oh, yes, yes. I do the whole works.  

Q: How do you get into your work? What sort  
of process do you go through?  

A: Every time I approach a project I shy  
away like a horse, because it is a new  
thing. You've lived another day. Even  
from one minute to another, we're changing.  
If you sit here 24 hours a day or a life-  
time, every second there is a change.  

Night doesn't come in a minute and a dawn  
doesn't come in a minute. It's gradual.  
Through the day it's moving a little bit.  
You don't see it, it's so slow to our eye.  

Our consciousness is the same. Let me say  
that I finished something and sat down to  
have lunch. I went through a whole thing of  
lunch, picking up the cup, the fork and so  
forth. There's great activity. By the time  
I come back (to work) I'm already an hour  
older. And already, I'm not quite the same.  
People never think about that—they miss,  
they jump, they don't think.  

And say, you, or whoever; I've had a dozen  
television and radio and newspaper inter-  
views here. Do you think I'm the same per-  
son that left New York? Don’t you think  
that that's already a world of experience  

in a few days? If you think of the phil-  
osophical things, the creative things, going  
to the museums and seeing things and being  
here. You could write ten volumes on what  
I've done here just by coming.  

So when I come to the work again I'm always  
I, but I've added to the consciousness.  
Every minute you get a little older so you  
touch it a little differently. And anyway,  
don't the books promise us that the compen-  
sation for old age is wisdom? You see?  
So, you don't get old in a minute and you  
don't get wisdom in a minute.  

A WOMAN’S MIND  

Q: You've said that your works are defin-  
itely the product of a feminine mind and  

that there's a difference between a man's  
mentality and a woman's mentality and the  

way a man's works and the way a woman's  
works. How does your work reflect that diff-  
erence, that woman's mind?  

A: Well, first, let me say that there are  
women, there are artists, that will not acc-  
ept this. But I only think I'm  
a woman. I'm not a man. I have all the or-  
gans that belong to the female sex and I've  
executed them from that point of view.  

Look, a man and a woman get together. The  
very position...or two people get together.  
Say I was standing up and facing you this  

way. You'd be looking here and I'd be look-  
ing there. Already we have a different per-  
spective. And it cannot be the same perspec-  

tive because of our whole makeup.  

And if you happen to like being a female,  
and if you're attractive and you get the  
attention you want and you've had a ball on  
that level, then you want to retain that fem-  
ininity. It's only, well, people that have  
not been successful somehow being female  
that want to switch and vice-versa. But I'm  
not going into the sex problem at this mo-  
ment. I rather like all the exposure of sex  
because I think we were educated so badly.  

Now, another thing, before I finish. For in-  
stance, I'm a great-grandmother and I'm not  
going to change because I've lived with this  
so long. But why should we be self-conscious  
of certain parts of our bodies? Why can't  
we claim our bodies? But we don't, I don't.  
With all my awareness and all my promiscuity,  
there's still something I don't claim. And  

I resent it in myself. It's too late for me  
to encompass it. But I would like to see  
people accept themselves from head to toe and  
also the aura around them.  

We'll come back to the femininity. I know  
that men will not hammer as I hammer. I  
know they have machinery. You see they were  
born that way. That's the way. The men were  
the carpenters and the men were the engineers.

GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,23,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page023.txt,"NEVELSON continued from page 21

and the men were this and the men were that.  
So, when they do a thing, they do it almost  
professionally. They'll bang and pound. And  
I think it's a riot. I have people, men who  
work with me, for instance, and they think if  
the thing is heavy they take a big nail and,  
oh, wow. Actually, the harder it is, we have  
used pins, you know, these pins, and were  
able to penetrate because if you're taking  
hard with hard it's almost impossible.

Because do men use a voice like a female,  
if women are women and men are men? So why  
should I superimpose in labor and in work  
and change who I am? The work is a total  
reflection of the person that made it.

Now, of course, a lot of people, even  
critics in New York, have said, ‘she works  
like a man.' I wouldn't have known it was a  
woman that did it.'

Well now, you see, who says that we're the  
weaker sex? We're different, but not the  
weaker sex. We were in a society that  
didn't permit us to blossom. But let them  
permit us to. But we have to take it and  
blossom. I don't want anyone to permit me  
that is also a slave mentality. I have  
chosen from childhood to live, or project,  

a life that I understand. And no one has to  
tell me.

Now, I got an assistant by accident—I al-  
ways had men work with me—but this girl  
graduated Yale in art and she was a friend  
of a young man who was working with me. He  
had to go away and she stayed on. I let her  
stay because I travel and I wanted not to be  
in the house alone. So she stayed on.

Q: Is this Diana MacKown?

A: That's right. Put her in, too, she'll  
love it and send me a copy, she'll love this.  
Well, because she's neglected when people  
come to the house.

But I have never felt anything but female.  
Now, if the things look big, well, so what?  
So I have more energy than a lot of men  
that haven't.

So I let her stay, but I didn't let her work  
with me. In other words, you see, I don't  
make drawings of things, but I compare right  
on there; to get many things, but particular-  
ly the immediacy, which I believe in a great  
deal. I don't believe in churning, I believe  
in action.

Q: This is my own interpretation, but your  
life seems to make a pattern. You have a  

few difficult situations in your life. You  
have your marriage and you have the terrible  
thing with Janis and your things being held  
hostage.

A: That's right, you're absolutely right.

So, after she stayed in the house awhile, I  
said all right, I'm going to let you work.  
And she did. And she hammered. She was  
divine. And I said 'Did you take a course  
in carpentry at Yale?' And she said, 'no.'  
And I said, ‘did you ever do this work?'

She said, 'no.'

Q: And you somehow break out of these  
things. You break out of these dominated  
situations and you get free and each time  
you do it you come back better than before,  
you're strong, your work is stronger.

How do you do that?

SELF REPORT CARD

Now both her parents were professional mus-  
icians of high quality. And I said, ‘well,  
how do you know to take this kind of nail  
for this and this kind of nail for that?'

A: Let me tell you before I start this,  

that I have a record for myself. You know  
see else at school you have a report card. Well, I  
hadn't got married and if I didn't have that  
trouble with Janis, I'd give myself a hun-  
dred plus. Now, those were enough to kill  
me because they weren't in my orbit, they  
weren't.

years. Isn't that fantastic? In other  
words, she wasn't working like a carpenter.  
She was working through music, she was com-  
posing. That's 10 years ago, and I still am  
in awe of a statement like that. I think  

it's great. And the results show it.

Out of this marriage, I have a son and grand-  
children and all. That's fine. But I can-  
not be appeased with all of it. Because I  
had my eyes wide open in both cases. There  
were things that both had that I wanted and  
it isn't very nice, but that's the way it  
was. And I live with that. Now, I didn't  
murder anyone and I didn't hurt anyone.

But for my kind of thinking I would have  
given myself a hundred plus if it weren't  
for those.

Now, I wanted some years ago a circle, like  
a drawing, like a line circle in wood to  

put in a box. Of course, I didn't know how  
to get it, but I knew if I could find the  
thinnest wood, a strip, I could put it in  
the bathtub and keep tying it as it got wet-  
ter and wetter. And so I went to the lumber  
yard and did get what you call clapboards.  
They put them in buildings, you know, before  
they put the plaster. That's about as thin  
as you can get them. And I took one home  
and I did put it in the tub and I tied it  
and tied it. And it got to the point where  
I could use it and then I did a few like  
that.

Isn't that funny? Now, you say, did I have  
such a high standard. I didn't think of it  
as high standard, but I did know in my con-  
sciousness, and I think every human being  

does, that, that is not for me.

Well, no man would be patient like that.  
They'd do something else, but they wouldn't  
nurse it. This is really a feminine thing.  
And even the way when I hammer. I knew men  
don't do it that way. I know that myself.

But, you see, when I married I only kind of  
excused it. You can say I have all the com-  
pensation because I have this gorgeous son  
who is a sculptor and is adorable to me."
GoldFlower,2,8,dec 1973,24,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No8_page024.txt,"And the grandchildren are great and all. But  
that move was made knowing that I shouldn't  

I was very young and I was in school and I  
thought of myself as not being too bright.  
Very attractive, but not too bright. So I  
had not lived. I had no experience, be-  
cause in the country (Rockland, Maine) I  
was young and then there was no one around.  
I was already dreaming of other things, so  
I wasn't interested in local color.  

I was not seasoned enough to believe in my-  
self. I thought, ‘well, there's a world,  
they get married and who am I to think this?'  
So I didn't trust it. But after that marr-  
iage, I took the reins in my hands and I  
never permitted the outside to have influ-  
ence.  

Now, with Janis, I just wanted to croak. Be-  
cause I felt I had fallen into the most heli-  
sh pit in the world. If they say there's  

a hell, that was more. You know, I lost my  
voice and I used to have to get up in the  
morning about six and learn to walk. It  

was that bad. I lost a lot of weight, too.  

I had people, like collectors, that were  
friends of mine, I had rich people. There  
wasn't one that offered. I was in a spot.  
My overhead is big. And not one ever—  
well, yes one did in a way, but not of that  
type—came and asked me could they be of  
any help.  

Well, what do you think that did? It made  
me stronger. It pushed me right back into  
myself and I dismissed it. You see, it's  
funny because I speak to you and you might  
say, well, I'm bitter. I'm not bitter be-  
cause I have achieved for myself and for my  
wellbeing a great deal of living. So that's  
fine. But it only made me go back into my-  
self.  

I love people, but they are like you eat  
strawberry pie, you know? They're not the  
meat of my life. And I don't think there's  
a soul on earth who is. You see, I have my  
own interpretation of friendship. I have my  
own interpretation of the humanities and  

the relationships.  

I had to, in order to survive and do what I  
feel was my lot to do. For me, only for me.  

If you talk like I am speaking to you, three  
dimensionally, you see we're brought up that  
you bow to your elders and that you do this  
and that. That's something else. Do you  
get the message?  

The older I get the more I feel I sit on my  
own seat and push back like this on my own  
back. And I don't bow to anyone.  

Now, I don't mean that I have to be arrog-  
ant, but I mean there's nobody to bow to,  
only to yourself. Look in the mirror and  
bow to yourself.  

@: You have played a role of establishing  
precedents for other women artists. You  
have been a pioneer in many senses. Do  
you think that there will be other women  

that will have the courage to follow after  
you?  

A: Let me tell you this. I think there  
will, but let me explain something. If  
Caruso wanted others to follow him, they  
would have the equivalent of that voice.  
Now, I wear myself out. I'm 74 and I wear  
myself out. And I get tired of all.  

I was born with ability and energy. And  
so, if another woman could match the ener-  
gy, I think they could. But that depends.  
Or maybe they won't need this. There are  
other ways of expressing creativity,  
besides the hard physical labor. So, I  
think, yes.  

Q: Where do you go from here?  

A: Oh my god, dear, just where I am. You  
can polish 'til doomsday. You see, I  
don't have to move a great deal, on the con-  
trary, it would be stupid for me. Because  
once you're in there and it's right, then,  
my god, it's unlimited, unlimited, and  
especially in our time with technology and  
the new materials. It isn't one thing,  
whole things burst open. Look, one rose has  
so many petals. And, my god, more than  
that, if you leave it, it gives other roses  
and more petals. But you don't become a  
violet, you're still a rose, you're true  

to that and then you multiply."

Legal Education  
Will Women Humanize  
by Jane Prohaska  

Rumor has it that the following exchange  
took place at that most prestigious center  
of legal education, Harvard Law School:  

Professor: Miss Smith, will you please  
state the holding of the case assigned  
for today?  

Woman Student: I would prefer to be called  
""Ms."" from now on.  

Professor: Miss Smith, I will call you  
damn broads anything I choose, if I  
choose to call on you at all.  

Whether or not this accurately represents  
the status of women at Harvard Law, I cannot  
say. If such were representative of the  
University of Minnesota where I am a first  
year law student, making the usual indict-  
ments of sex discrimination would be all too  
easy. However, the situation here is a com-  
plex one due to certain concessions already  
made by the University law school, due to  
the women law students themselves, and most  
of all, due to the structure of legal educa-  
tion and the legal profession itself.  

First of all, it is important to realize  
being a first year law student - male  
or female - is an overwhelming situation.  

My first reaction when asked if I would be  
interested in writing about women and law  
school was that I couldn't possibly find  
time. After all, my first final exams are  
only ten weeks away. The object of law  
school, as I view it, is to keep you so busy  
studying and so confused about the materials  
you are studying that you have no time at  
all to reflect on the situation thrust upon  
you. For not only was I too busy to write  
this article, but I didn't have the proper  
perspective. I am merely a confused first  
year student and don't yet understand the  
workings of the legal field. This evalua-  
tion of law school as it relates to women is  
highly prejudicial, as is any individual's  
critique of an institution with which they  
are not fully satisfied, but I do not be-  
lieve that makes it invalid.  

Not Blatant  

I have never been faced with a situation  
such as the Harvard anecdote. In fact, I  
have not run across blatant institutional  
discrimination at the law school at all. The  
admissions committee has made fairly impres-  
sive moves with women comprising 20% of my  
class, or about 50 of 250 students. This  
is remarkable only when considering that  
in the third year class of the same size  
there are less than 20 women.  

Since all of my classes consist of first  
year students, women do not seem out of  
place. They are not noticeable; they belong  
as much as any other student. Women are not  
singled out for abuse or neglect during  
class discussions, as I have been told they  
had in the past.  

It is assumed in law school that all stu-  
dents have only surnames and this uniform  
policy has led to some confusion for pro-  
fessors who wonder how to refer to women.  

Law School ?  

Most have resorted to ""Miss"" despite the  
fact that a large number are married. One  
professor went to great pains to explain  
to us that he really would like to call us  
""Ms."" but the other was so ingrained that  
he used it unconsciously. He sincerely  
apologized if anyone was offended. As a  
sort of compromise he merely points at vol-  
unteers and says ""Ma'am?"" There have been  
no confrontations so the name remains uncon-  
tested.  

There are still problems. There is only  
one woman on the teaching faculty, although  
attempts are being made to secure one or two  
more for next year. The problem, as explained  
by one faculty member, is that competent  
women law professors are in such demand that  
they are hard to come by. Using competent  
women lawyers on a part-time basis has not  
been an alternative I've heard under discus-  
sion.  

In the area of placement, there is a great  
deal to be done. Interviewing firms don't  
ask men if they intend to have a family.  

Nor do they tell them that in front of a  
jury with a majority of women, their case  
won't stand a chance, especially if they are  
attractive. But the placement office is  
working with women to find out what their  
major complaints are so that these can be  
collectively expressed to interviewers to  
help further their enlightenment.  

“I Wouldn’t Want to Marry One”  
The social atmosphere in the law school is  
a somewhat different situation. Academically,  
women are well-respected by male stu-  
dents, or perhaps feared because they do  
better percentage-wise than their male  
counterparts. One male second year student  
was particularly pleased with me because  
upon exchanging law board scores - a con-  
stant pastime many law students engage in  
to reassure themselves that they are more  
intelligent than the next - he “finally dis-"
GoldFlower,2,9,january 1974,3,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No9_page003.txt,"covered a girl who has lower scores than I  
do."" There is not disdain for the brighter  
women - merely an attitude of ""I wouldn't  
want to marry one.""  

There is a sort of fraternity atmosphere  
around the law school, complete with foot-  
ball pools and poker games. In fact, there  
is an actual law fraternity with ""Mixers""  
with undergraduate sororities so ""the guys  
in the house can get to meet some girls.""  
Signs advertising such an event read ""Law  
Students $1.50; Girls 50¢."" In an attempt  
to remedy this inadvertent error - as it was  
explained to me - the word ""male"" was inser-  
ted after ""Law Students.""  

To be fair to the law fraternity, though,  
while it houses only men at the present time  
I was told by the president that any woman  
who wanted could move in. It strikes me as  
not in the least surprising that no one has  
yet jumped at the opportunity.  

Of course, it is not fair to let the as-  
sumption be made that all men in law school  
share the above outlook on life. The truth  
is that most law students ignore the whole  
issue and just keep on studying.  

My real dissatisfaction with law school is  
not so much based on the personal attitudes  
of my ""colleagues"" or the gaps in the insti-  
tutional attempts to promote equal treatment  
of men and women. In fact, my discontent has  

but with the basic attitudes, pressures, and  
practices of law school which affect all  
students and with the lack of any collective  
effort by women to counteract these tradi-  
tions of legal education.  

Humiliation & Razor Blades  

I have already commented on the amount of  
time consumed in study.  
that there is a large amount of work to  
be done, but that there is the constant feel-  
ing that no matter how much you do, you  
should be doing more. I cannot pinpoint the  
source of the pressure - much of it is from  
the teaching technique of randomly calling  
on students in class and questioning an in-  
dividual until confusion reigns supreme. The  
result is that students must constantly over  
prepare to avoid total humiliation should  
they be the victim of the day.  

A great deal of pressure comes from the  
students themselves. The fierce sense of  
competitiveness that prevails is frighten-  
ing. Books disappear, articles are razor-  
bladed from journals - not because a student  
needs such materials - but in order to keep  
other students from using them and possibly  
getting better grades. For after all, bet-  
ter grades, better jobs, and more money is  
the point of all this, is it not?  

Cooperation sometimes exists, but the  
school's honor code prohibits it, even  
while doing research. For cooperation works  
against the grain of the adversary system -  
a system based on two people taking opposite  
sides of an issue, each arguing one side of  
the issue to its logical/illogical extreme  
and then, somehow in the process, ""justice  
will be achieved.""  

My hope for the women's movement at large  
is that not only will it help to raise the  
level of consciousness and remove inequality  
but that it will also help remold the opera-  
tion of those institutions in which women  
are demanding equal acceptance.  

Caucus & Competition  

This is unfortunately not the case at the  
University of Minnesota law school.  

There is a caucus of Law Women which has  
developed programs to encourage women to  
attend law school, brought feminist speakers  

nothing to do with sex discrimination at all,  

It is not so  

to campus, and even purchased a subscription  
to MS magazine for the library. But so far,  
the Women's Caucus has been unable to produce a  
spirit of cooperation, even among women,  
which might begin to counterbalance the com-  
petitive emphasis faced by all of us. What  
really bothers me is that the women at the  
law school are every bit as competitive as  
the men. And no one seems to have the time  
to contemplate change.  

The reasons are not obvious, but they are  
easy to understand. In the past, women in  
law have had to work much harder than men  
to receive equal recognition, and somehow,  
once they have received that recognition, it  
is easy for them to forget the means by  
which they had achieved it. At the present,  
a number of women at law school have made  
careful and deliberate decisions to enter  
the legal profession and they are highly  
goal oriented. Doing a good job in their  
chosen field is more important than attempt-  
ing to reform the process. Similarly, a  
number of married women with children have  
a hard enough time carving out the time  
necessary to study without contemplating  
change.  

In addition, the fact that the administra-  
tion at the law school has taken the steps  
it has in some of the major issues means  
that there are no well-defined causes or  
grievances around which women might rally  
together. Without such a base, it is much  
more difficult to form a cohesive group to  
fight the more pervading atmosphere of law  
school itself.  

I do not mean any of this as a condemna-  
tion of women in law school, and I certainly  
cannot exempt myself from the syndromes I  
have explained. Many of the women I meet  
are very strong individuals who are quite  
used to running - achieving on their own,  

common practice base, even if it were to  
concern itself with changing the style of  
legal education. Many are quite content  
with the status quo, but a great number of  
men are also upset with the excessive empha-  
sis on competition.  

Women have gained much through legal chan-  
nels in establishing their rights. And  
within its own structure, women are gaining  
status in the legal world. But these accom-  
plishments and the concrete increase in the  
number of women law students should not lead  
women to think that all is over and we are  
on our way.

and promotion practices.

Dare To Rebel

Sex discrimination is ille-  
gal. Women are taking legal  
action against employers in  
increasing numbers with in-  
creasing success.

But the women who filed the  
first sex discrimination suits  
took big risks—from being  
fired to being labeled a  
troublemaker, an anathema  
to prospective employers.

Ellen Dresselhuis, Minnea-  
polis attorney and active  
member of the Women's Equity  
Action League, handles many  
of the city's sex discrimina-  
tion suits. She admires the  
women who ""really stuck their  
necks out"" by undertaking the  
slow, costly process of pro-  
secuting a suit.

But now, explains Dressel-  
huis, there is a new, effec-  
tive tool which protects the  
individual seeking equal pay.  
Under Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act and other provi-  
sions, suits can be filed by  
organizations on behalf of an  
individual who can remain an-  
onymous and protected from  

discrimination with the E-  
qual Employment Opportunity  
Commission. There is an o-  
verwhelming backlog of cases  
to be investigated, but even-  
tually the Commission will  
assign an investigator to  
make a thorough study of the  
company's practices.

Two NOW members met with  
Land-O'-Lakes representa-  
tives last fall as part of  
a survey of Twin Cities em-  
ployment practices. One mem-  
ber said the company repre-  
sentatives expected them to  
""sit there like little la-  
dies,"" telling them only  
what they wanted them to hear.  
When the NOW members  
began asking questions, the  
company reps acted ""insulted  
and embarrassed.""

""We knew some of the women  
who had been working there  
and heard their stories,""  
said one NOW member, and the  
picture the company painted  
""just didn't connect right.""

NOW members say women often  
receive unequal pay for equal  
work, while minority employ-  
ees of either sex are almost  
non-existent in the company.

retaliatory action. Organi-  

zations like the Equal Employ-  
ment Opportunities Commission  
which formerly had only con-  

ciliatory powers, can now sue  
offending businesses.

Unequal pay and unfair hir-  
ing practices have been cost-  
ly for the men and women who  
lost out in the past. Now  
business is beginning to re-  
alize the costs of sex dis-  
crimination. Losing court  
cases is costly but not near-  
ly as costly as under-utiliz-  
ing the talents of all the  
people they employ.

When will businesses alter  
their behavior? ""When it  
starts costing them money,""  
says Dresselhuis. ""Discrim-  
ination is just not good bus-  
iness practice.""

With more companies paying  
attorney's fees and fines,  
sex discrimination suits are  
increasingly effective in  
changing business's treatment  
of women and minorities. Af-

A NOW member from Iowa vis-  
ited a Land-O'-Lakes plant in  
southern Minnesota and tour-  
ed a production line. She  
asked the male supervisor why  
all the production workers  
were women, and he said, ""On-  
ly women would work for these  
low wages.""

The company took repress-  
ive measures against women  
who dared rebel. For example,  
some of the clerical workers  
tried to form a union. The  
company president sent a let-  
ter to clerical employees  
questioning the need for such  
a union, since the company  
""does so well for its employ-  
ees.""

At times the management has  
used gangster movie tactics  
in its fight to maintain the  
status quo. At one point a  
corporate secretary attended  
a clerical union meeting to  
""spy""; she took notes and  
made a full report to manage-  
ment.

Even the Land-O'-Lakes sym-  

bol, an Indian woman, is an  
unwitting reminder of the  
company's discrimination:  
there are no Indian women on  
the Board of Directors or in  
top management at Land-O'-  
Lakes.

es the threat of a discrimin-  
ation suit will have more im-  
pact according to Dresselhuis.

Most of those who are fil-  
ing suits are women who are  
supporting themselves and  
their families or those who  
are recently divorced and  
living on their own. “They  
are most aware of the pro-  
blems,"" Dresselhuis explains.  
But the real changes have to  
come for the average woman  
with a high school diploma  
and those women who are ""a  
heartbeat away from welfare.""

Equality in employment will  
come, says Dresselhuis, ""the  
day the average woman can  
make as much as the average  
man.""

She says the woman who is  
willing to be underutilized  
is as responsible for keep-  
ing women down as the boss  
who doesn't promote her. ""Women  
have to be alert and un-  
derstand that they are enti-  
tled to be recognized for  
their abilities."""

Lesbian Separatism--  
A Straight View  

Dear Sisters:  

I am writing in response  
to some real concern I felt  
and still feel about certain  
political views expressed at  
The Season of the Witch--  
namely--""Lesbian Separatism.""  
It's not that I hadn't been  
exposed to it before or hadn't  
been in groups that dealt with  
it before, but I  

think hearing the ideas so  
strongly presented at the  
same time we were feeling  
such pride and sisterhood  
and power threw me off bal-  
ance and I still feel the  
need to share my feelings  
with my sisters.  

In order to identify my  
concern, I guess I need to  
state that I have no objec-  
tion to a separatist philoso-  
phy that removes gay women  
from association with men. I  
have no objection to a separ-  
atist philosophy that encour-  
ages gay women to occasional-  
ly withdraw from straight wo-  
men to gain strength and sup-  
port from each other. But I  
do object to a separatist  
philosophy that completely  
withdraws from straight wom-  
en as a matter of political  
principle and further casts  
straight women into the role  
of collaborator and states  
that straight women aren't  
honest in their politics.  

I guess what's moving me to  
write is fear. I see too  
many of my sisters steering  
themselves toward something I  
was raised in--namely a reac-  
tionary fundamentalism that  
refuses to allow anyone else  
their portion of truth.  

It's not that I can't under-  
stand the idea of complete  
separatism. The logical, al-  
most mathematically precise,  
extension of the feminist  
movement, given the present  
patriarchal capitalistic sys-  
tem we live in, is separatism  

(with, hopefully, some way  
to achieve spontaneous gen-  
eration.)  

But I am not yet persuaded  
that the reason for men's  
differences is solely physi-  
cal in origin and not more  
sociologically and psycho-  
logically based. If the pro-  
blems are caused by physio-  
logical differences then we  

can have no hope and I will  
end my letter here and be-  
come celibate. But if, as I  
suspect, the problems lie in  
programming and conditioning  
then the problems can be o-  
vercome by education and con-  
ditioning of a different na-  
ture. This generation of  
men and probably the next  
several generations are ir-  
revocably lost. It's the  
future generations who can  
be liberated from the kinds  
of roles men have created  
for themselves and for us.  

If you choose to separate  
yourselves from this genera-  
tion of men I see that as a  
legitimate choice and I do  
not quarrel with it.  

But I am tired of seeing  
women who are working for fu-  
ture generations cast in the  
roles of oppressors them-  
selves or at best as colla-  
borators because they don't  
fit into what is to you an  
acceptable mold.  

I am also tired of sarcas-  
tic remarks about trying to  
find ""The Exceptional Man.""  
Let me put it on the record  
right now--there is no such  
thing as an exceptional man.  
They are all too bound up in  
their own conditioning. At  
best, what a man can be right  
now is someone who knows what  
is--an oppressor--and doesn't  
like it. At best, what a man  
can be right now is someone  
who will admit he is confused  
and threatened by women but  
wants to keep the lines open  
for an attempt at compassion  
and hopefully love. At best,  
what a man can be right now  
is someone who will try not  
to say--""I understand,"" be-  
cause he knows he never can.  
This is the best a man can be  
right now; but exceptional--  
no way! So let me call off  
the search for this mythical  
beast.  

I'm not into devoting my  
energies to changing today's  
man either. That's his own  
job if it can be done. I  
guess my hope is for our sons  
and daughters to live as per-  
sons, not role players.  

Why do I live with a man  
then? The purpose of this  
letter is not to give apolo-  
gies for my own lifestyle so  
an explanation as such will  
not be given beyond this:  
the relationship we have is  
based on our common humanity.  
I refuse to devote my ener-  
gies to fighting roles in  

this relationship and that  
is well understood. And, as  
you are probably discovering,  
once roles are removed the  
possibility for a relation-  
ship based on human values  
can be realized. Further, I  
refuse to deny my own sexual  
preferences just as I support  
my gay sisters in their re-  
fusal to deny theirs.  

You may ask why I even con-  
cern myself with this ques-  
tion then. Why don't I just  
ignore the whole issue? I  
guess the love I felt for all  
my sisters in that room dur-  
ing The Season of the Witch  
is part of the reason I re-  
fuse to ignore it. I refuse  
to remove myself from any of  
my sisters who are struggling  
against oppression. If a se-  
paration occurs, it will be  
my gay sisters who will ini-  
tiate it. And the more I  
read, the more conferences I  
attend, the more workshops  
etc. I sit through, the more  
I realize that such a split  

is becoming inevitable.  

It may be understandable  
but I have always felt, I  
felt that night, and I will  
always feel that we are wom-  
en--sisters truly--and all in  
this struggle together. We  
need each other. Any denial  
of our commonality hurts us  
all and drains power from the  
whole of the body of woman.  
That lost power doesn't drain  
off to any of the segments  
either. It drains from us  
directly to our oppressors.  

I guess the most painful  
outcome of this split will be  
the loss of too many real  
friends. That kind of loss  
leaves holes and I don't want

was mentioned as having more
applications than it can han
dle. C.E.A. operates at a
limited capacity because:

1) Small classes facili-
tate personal conduct be-
tween students, instructors,
and teaching assistants.

2) Small classes encour-
age active participation of
all the people in the class.
CEA never turns away anyone
seeking preparation for child
birth, unless all eleven lo-
cations are at capacity. The
screeners who register people
by telephone try to offer
several options as to what
location, time, and series a
person wants to attend. We
now plan to offer approximately
100 series in 1974, with
an active teaching staff of
23 instructors and hundreds of
teaching assistants, and a
support system of volunteers
from the community.

We welcome all pregnant wo-
men to give CEA a call, and
learn about what we offer in
education and training for
childbirth.

I personally am very excit-
ed about the growing field of
Midwifery; this will offer a
real choice to all women.

Thanks,

Clinic Regroups

Now that it's midwinter we
have found that our way to
achieve our goals needed some
changing. Within the last
few weeks, through hours of
discussion, we have come to
some new conclusions. We
would like to establish a wo-
men's health center for edu-
cation, self-help, counseling
and discovery. This is a
change from what we have
struggled to become for the
last 9 months.

Our goals, as a refresher, 

are still the same. They are
grand and glorious, and yet
we have hope that we can
start to tackle them. We
wish to change the way health
care is delivered by consumer
control, alleviating the hier-
archical structure of health
care workers, undermining the
drug companies' power, giving
women knowledge and control
of their bodies! (How about
that!)

In the past we felt that if
we opened a clinic we could
be an example of how these
changes could affect delivery
of health care. But after
many long hours of discussion
we felt that to do x-amount
of Pap and x-amount of VD
cultures we would end up
draining all our energies
just on service. There are
a lot of facilities that peo-
ple can use, granted none are
giving ""good"" service. But
by using our energies to put
the education of women and
health care workers on top of
our list we feel we might
accomplish more (to change
existing service for all wo-
men).

So the Center now has a pro-
gram which started with our
education. We have broken
ourselves up into five major
work groups. Each group
takes its own responsibility
for one facet of the center.
They are as listed:

Funding--a never-ending pro-
blem. The group is busy
learning new language and
writing an “in-house"" purpo-
sal. We also have a video
tape to use at the funding
boards. Any ideas for places
to go are welcome.

Classes--We would like to
offer classes, probably 5
sessions at the Health Center
on women's health.

We start our first health
class February 6 at 7:30.
There will be a fee, as yet
unknown. This is an intro-
duction and a general class
on health and women. From
this class we hope people
will go into collective study
groups on individual smaller
topics. We feel this class
will give a broad base for
women to continue to learn
from. The class topics are
as follows:

1) feminism and politics

2) anatomy and self-help

3) hormone system and men-
opause

4) birth control and abor-
tion

5) VD and vaginal infec-
tions

6) sexuality

7) birth and children

8) health care issues

9) preventive medicine and
Eastern medicine

We want to limit the class
to 15 women and hope that
people will attend all nine.
If the registration is high
we will start a second class
on Tuesday at 7:30. All classes
at 2000 South 5th St, the
People’s Center.

Introduction and Speaking
Gigs. We hope to do a lot of
speaking gigs and do some
teaching on self-help. Any
group can call and ask for
this.

Each Wednesday night there
is an open-ended introduction
session about the Center, fem-
inism, and an opportunity to
learn self-help. The direc-
tion of these discussions
will be determined by the
needs and feelings of the in-
dividual women present.
Please come and see what we
have to offer.

Counseling--There will be
counselors trained for coun-
seling or for referral. Op-
portunities for referral are:

1) health classes

2) an open-ended support
group

3) women's rap groups

4) counselors with a fem-
inist perspective will
be available for long-
term counseling.

Evaluation--As a feminist
group we feel the need to
also evaluate what we do, and
how we accomplish our objec-
tives. The group is develop-
ing a framework within which
we can evaluate ourselves.

We believe it is necessary
to have a structure which
still allows us to be human
and free. We hope this is
informative and lets you know
where we are at. If you want
any further information please
contact us. Someone
is at the Center all day M-F.

We are anxious to involve
more women in our center.

Seeking Community,  
Exploring New Sensibility  

Collecting information on the Women Poets  
of the Twin Cities, I felt like the prover-  
bial blind men trying to understand an ele-  
phant by touch. It is a writer's workshop,  
I exclaimed, grabbing at one end. It's a  
feminist consciousness raising group, I  
thought, checking out another part. It  
exists to sponsor readings. No, its pur-  
pose is to establish critical standards.  
Each time I explored another aspect of the  
Women Poets of the Twin Cities, it seemed a  
different organization--and the whole makes  
up quite as unlikely an animal as that pro-  
verbial elephant.  

Undefinable and All-Embracing  

The Women Poets themselves are as undefi-  
nable as their organization. Looking at  
Phebe Hanson, one sees a Woman Poet to be a  
fortyish professional woman and mother who  
began writing recently after a long silence.  
But then, a Woman Poet seems to be academi-  
cally trained, published in literary maga-  
zines and involved in Minnesota publishing  
ventures, like Jenne Andrews. Or a faculty  
wife and mother long active in local liter-  
ary activities (like Beryle Williams), or  
a dedicated and experienced public reader  
(like Mary Ellen Shaw) or a college drop-  
out and former resistance worker (like Mary  
Pat Flandrick). Or some 30 other possibili-  
ties, one for each member of this amorphous  
organization.  

The Women Poets themselves are perhaps  
best described by the continuums upon which  
they fall: from teen-aged to middle-aged,  
from counterculture to middle-class, from  
gay to straight, from politically radical to  
moderate, from just embarking on a literary  
career to semi-established. Their rather an-  
archic organization slides across other con-  
tinuums, from private to public, from per-  
sonal to political, from poetic to polemical.  

The generic name is a symbol of the in-  
clusiveness and diversity of the group: to  
be a Woman Poet of the Twin Cities is to be  
just that. Patricia Hampl, who's too busy to  
attend meetings, still feels part of the  
group, saying, ""I'm a woman writing poetry  
in St. Paul. By definition I'm a Woman Poet  
of the Twin Cities."" There are active members  
and inactive members, and members who haven't  
yet joined.  

by Pat Monaghan  

Invisible Women Poets  

Doubtless, two years ago there were women  
poets in the Twin Cities. There were numer-  
ous poetry readings and a burgeoning sense  
of literary community. But women were rare  
on the platform and in local publications.  
They were excluded from speaking at poetry  
seminars and other educational events, or  
represented by a token few. There were  
women poets here, but no one knew how many,  
or who they were.  

Then at a reading featuring men poets,  
Penny Seuss abruptly turned to Beryle Willi  
ams and demanded, ""If I have a reading, will  
you read?"" Four women organized the first  
reading, held in November, 1971, that drew  
what Williams calls ""a devoted audience.""  

""We organized because we weren't hearing  
any women's poetry, and weren't getting ac-  
quainted in private ways,” Williams explain-  
ed. ""It grew out of our need. We needed to  
write and share and have it heard.""  

An open reading at the end of the program  
brought more women poets into evidence. A  
meeting soon after brought out even more,  
and the Women Poets of the Twin Cities (WP-  
TC) was launched.  

Some of the women are harsh on the poetic  
establishment that drove them to organize a  
separate group. ""Men were turning poetry  
readings into wakes,” grimaces Flandrick.  
""Now, wakes can be very moving. But I want  
to go to poetry readings and find poets who  
excite me.""  

Shaw, who organized the first meeting of  
the WPTC, deplores ""the club of poets who  
were reading private jokes and disserta-  
tions."" She remembers the ""exciting vision""  
that led to the organization of the Women  
Poets. ""We felt we could be a great new  
force in literature, writing not against but  
for each other. We felt that we could build  
a community of artists. We wanted to write  
closer to the life of people and to our own  
life, to speak to an audience that had been  
turned off by poetry. We felt that we could  
change the ideas of women and their lives."""
GoldFlower,2,9,january 1974,8,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol2No9_page008.txt,"Since its formation, WPTC has held more-or
less weekly meetings, at which any of a va-
riety of activities can take place. Some-
times the evening is devoted to considering
the work of a major woman poet, sometimes

to a visit with poets of the reputation of
Diane Di Prima or Eve Merriam. There are
intensive individual critiques of the work
of individual members. There are open read-
ings, each poet presenting her latest work.
And sometimes WPTC holds business meetings
to plan an upcoming public reading and other
projects.

WPTC -- Public and Private

Shaw calls the group ""organized anarchy,""
while Hanson suggests the milder term ""re-
latively unstructured organization."" Leader-
ship is fluid. ""The leadership is passed
from one to another for brief periods. Any-
one who happens to have a project in mind is
leader for the moment,"" Hansen explains.

For a group which has no formal structure
--""We'll never be a 'proper' organization,""
laughs Hanson--WPTC has sponsored a remark-
able number of activities: six large-scale
public readings, 15 smaller readings at
such places as the St. Paul Open School and
Stillwater State Prison, a dozen mixed
readings in which women poets participated,
and six chapbooks featuring women poets. An
anthology is in progress.

Public activities reveal only one side
of the group's purpose, for WPTC functions
as much as a support group and critical
workshop as it does as a voice for women's
literary rights. This duality of function is
reflected in the different attitudes WPTC
members have about the organization, and
about their work. ""Some of us are primarily
concerned with writing; our primary aim is
to be as professional as possible,"" says
Shaw. “For others, the writing is tangential
to political aspirations of liberating wo-
men."" “Everyone comes to the group with dif-
ferent needs and expectations,"" Flandrick
explains.

Despite this, WPTC attempts to support
each woman's struggle to define an artistic
identity. For some, such support is a heady
experience. ""I still feel like I'm giving
religious testimony when I talk about the
group,"" says Hanson. ""Starting to think
about myself as a serious poet was an ec-
static experience. At first I was so fragile
and it was so scary. The Women Poets have
made me feel that what I have to say is im-
portant, that my experiences, however li-
mited, are valuable. It took me 25 years to
find that out."" Women, Hanson claims, are
conditioned ""to put ourselves and our own
experiences down. I remember, not long ago,
half-apologizing to a man for liking Joan
Didion.""

Public and private activities merge, Wil-
liams feels, in the growing public aware-
ness of WPTC and of its members. ""You never
heard of us as individuals. We have each
gained more public notice than we would have
without this group.""

In addition to offering encouragement,
the group attempts to provide critical
analysis for the emerging poets. A problem
arises, however, in determining what stand-
ards to apply. Some women poets feel their
work has been judged by male standards, that
their unique vision has not been valued.

POETRY

""You can open your pants in public view,
but don't open the kitchen door,” snorts
Williams.

While Hanson denounces male critics for
being ""not tuned in to female sensibility,""
she admits another problem, that ""women
don't generally have the ego-strength of men
and are more vulnerable to criticism""--for
which reason the group restricts its mem-
bership to women. Shaw elaborates: ""We
felt that with only women, we'd work on a
sharing human basis; just because we're wo-
men. Well, it works and it doesn't work.
Right now it's the closest thing to an artis-
tic community there is here.""

Flandrick describes it another way. ""Most
women I know are just working on becoming
self-centered--that's different, you know,
from being selfish. I used to buy the myth-
ology of artist-as-neurotic, of having to
transcend the ego. Well, women for the most
part don't have an ego to transcend. If
poetry is going to be saved, it's going to
be the women that save it.""

Although the Women Poets profess to reject
male poetic sensibility, they have not yet
defined an alternative. ""We've never evolved
a standard,"" Shaw says. ""But I notice that
even when women write angry poems, there is
an element of tenderness, of sorrow,"" Wil-
liams sees women as ""less myopic, more out
of the ego bubble, than men.

""What we do know,"" she sums up, ""now that
we're hearing enough of women's poetry, is
that it is a different body than men's
poetry, and that some of it is vital, and
some is not."""

Conclusion

NOTE TO READERS: The

author was, until recently,  
employed by a Twin Cities  
firm. In May 1972 she filed  
a sex discrimination charge  
against the corporation with  
the Minnesota Department of  
Human Rights. Subsequently,  
she also filed a charge of  
race and sex discrimination  
against the corporation with  
the federal Equal Employment  
Opportunities Commission  
(EEOC).

PART I of this series out-  
lined events leading up to  
the filing of a sex dis-  
crimination charge, the fil-  
ing procedure and the con-  
frontation of the author  

and her supervisor after he  
was served with the charge.

PART II detailed the auth-  
or's relationship with her  
employer after she filed  

the charge and outlined some  
of the pitfalls a woman can  
encounter in a sex discrim-  
ination case.

PART III concludes the  
series.

Out ?

A writer should never plan  
a three-part series on any-  
thing. Facing the conclus-  
ion of this story, I find  
that my blood has cooled sig-  
nificantly and ennui has  

set in. After some thought,  
however, I conclude that a  
paler mood is appropriate  

to the last segment of my  
story on sex discrimination  
in employment.

Cooled ardor allows me  
some perspective.

As I noted in PART II, my  
employer quickly removed its  
hand from the velvet glove  
when I proved intractable  

and would not drop my charge.  
The company then began its  
series of time-wasting maneu-  
vers to keep me occupied  
charting my ""career path"" and  
stating job objectives while  
the Personnel Department  

ne. my.aec-

tion.

I filed my charge in May  
1972. By August I realized  
an attorney was necessary. I  
retained a Twin Cities att-  
orney experienced in dis-  
crimination cases.

Together we reviewed my  
case and awaited the outcome  
of the Department of Human  
Rights' investigation. In  
November 1972 the Commission-  
er of Human Rights delivered  
a decision--""no probable  
cause"" to assume that my em-  
ployer had discriminated a-  
gainst me, and by extrapol-  
ation, against women as a  
class.

I was unhappy but not sur-  
prised. After some hesita-  
tion, I met with my attorney  
and together we planned an  
appeal to the State Appeal  
Board.

~

In January 1973 my attorn-  
ey and I faced representa-  
tives of my employer at a  
Board hearing. I felt at  
the hearing that we made our  
point. My employer's agents  
found that slick phrases and  
expensive clothing were in-  
adequate defenses against my  
charges.

In April 1973 I was noti-  
fied that the Appeal Board  
had reversed the Commission-  

by Mary Hastings

er's finding and sent my  
case “back for reinvestiga-  
tion”.

At this writing, the ""re-  

investigation"" has been com-  
pleted and I await the Appeal  
Board's further action in the  
matter.

In the interim, however,  
the laws governing filing of  
sex discrimination charges  
have been changed. (See  
February ""Gold Flower"" for  
article on changes in the  
law.) According to a Depart-  
ment attorney, the Appeal  
Board no longer has the final  
word in sex discrimination  
cases. The Board may rule,  
but the case must then return  
to the State Department of  
Human Rights for final dis-  
position.

One of the most frustrating  
elements—e experience  

has been the very confusing and  
seemingly complicated proced-  
ures the Minnesota Department  
of Human Rights follows in  
investigating a sex discrim-  
ination charge. Any woman con-  
templating filing a charge  
should be prepared to closely  
monitor the progress of her  
case through that Department.  
I have been told that under-

staffing causes delay and  
confusion, but reformation of  
this Department is impera-  
tive.

Women--very vocal and in  
great numbers--must impress  
their state legislators with  
the necessity to adequately  
fund the Human Rights De-  
partment--and to follow up  
with a convincing show of  
commitment to the cause of  
human rights.

As a result of filing a  
sex discrimination charge, I  
have learned a great deal a-  
bout frustration in the face  
of bureaucracy. And, iron-  
ically, I have come to view  
the entire process as fut-  
ile--a meaningless act de-  
fined by male standards. It  
is utterly ridiculous to  
spend two years, money I  
could ill afford and emotion-  
al reserves to prove that my  
employer discriminated a-  
gainst women.

Do fish swim? Does the

I hope I will find an

I will leave men at their

in their board rooms, howl-

the void created by their  
hatred and fear.

by Heidi Reidell

Women in Minneapolis are

working for bread, not jew-
els. As in all other parts
of the country, the bread
seems more like crumbs—
fully employed women earn $3
for every $5 earned by their
male counterparts. The dis-
crepancy in pay has widened
during the past 15 years, but
the mechanics for change in
Minneapolis are growing
stronger.

The stereotype of the work-
ing girl who leaves her job
to marry and have children
doesn't hold up today. Three
fifths of the working women
in Minneapolis are married
and living with their hus-
bands and one-third are moth-
ers with children under the
age of six.

Most women work to raise
their families' standard. In families where the
husband earns between five
and seven thousand dollars
per year, 46% of the wives
work. In Minneapolis, 15% of
working mothers are heads of
households and only 5% of
these women receive welfare
funds. One fifth of working
women are single and self-
supporting and few women have
the luxury of working solely
for personal fulfillment.

Women have always worked to
support themselves and their
families. But since the in-
dustrial revolution women
have left the home and enter-
ed a labor system based on
the obsolete assumption that
they are marking time until
they can retire to the kit-
chen.

Women's role in the labor
force has changed radically
in the last 50 years. The
average woman worker in the
1920s was 28 years old and
single. She comprised 20% of
the labor force and had a life
expectancy of 55 years.

Today, the average working
woman is 39, married and was
30 years old when she sent her
last child off to school. She
can expect to live to be
75 years old.

Working women today are
highly educated. One woman
in ten has a college degree.
However, of the 91,000 work-
ing women in Minneapolis, 42%
have clerical jobs (5% higher
than the national average)
and only 3% are in managerial
positions (0.3% higher than
the national average). In
executive positions, men out-
number women 600 to 1.

From counterculture women's
organizations to a drop-in
center at the YWCA, women are
helping each other find jobs,
training and adequate day-
care facilities.

Aside from social and pol-
itical women's groups, self-
help professional groups are
forming. One such group,
Women in Communication, has
a job placement service
where women exchange inform-
ation about job openings that
are not usually announced pub-
licly.

Some local groups are aff-
iliated with national organ-
izations. Efforts are un-
derway to start a service
modeled after Catalyst, an
organization that places wom-
en in jobs and also pairs wo-
men with similar training so
they can share one job and
work part-time.

Within individual companies
women are becoming more vo-
cal about equal pay, job ad-
vancement and adequate day-
care for their children.

Careers are no longer a
secondary concern of women.

Many are choosing to postpone
having children at all. Those with
small children are working
in increasing numbers. Thir-
ty-five percent of mothers
with children under six are
working.

There are gross inequities
in pay scales, hiring and
promotion policies in Minn-
eapolis and the nation. But
the tools of change are be-
ing wielded by many deter-
mined and dedicated people
in this city.

The traditional female occ-
upations are filled to over-
flowing. Career planners see
expanding job opportunities
in the professions (medicine,
science, engineering, law,
architecture) and in voca-
tional careers (electronics,
mechanics, etc.).

But changing a nation's
labor structure takes time
and effort. The southern
congressman who tacked the
word sex on the 1964 Civil
Rights law in order to quash
the effort, inadvertently
gave women one of their most
powerful tools of advance-
ment. From this legislation
came the momentum for poten-
tially powerful legal action
against sex discrimination
and for legally required
affirmative action programs.
The mechanics to equalize
pay and promotion policies
are there.

Those involved in chang-
ing women's role in the em-
ployment world point to one
vital force of change—the
women themselves. And women
in Minneapolis are banding
together to better their
employment situation.

Harriet Lansing and Judy
Oakes, two attorneys, have
opened Minnesota's first
all-women law firm in St.
Paul.

Located at 400 Sibley St.,
Oakes & Lansing is one of
some half-dozen women's firms
in the nation.

Although they will not be
restricting their practice
to women, the lawyers feel
that their feminist philo-
sophy will affect their en-
tire practice. Assisting
them is a law clerk, a stu-
dent at William Mitchell Law
School.

Both Lansing and Oakes are
graduates of the University
of Minnesota Law School.
Oakes previously was an as-
sistant attorney general for
the state of Minnesota (the
first woman to be promoted
to that post) while Lansing
was a city attorney in St.
Paul (the first woman to
be appointed to that position).

prejudice.

My father is NOT a member
of liberal America. But this
attitude towards homosexuality
is also quite common among
the well-educated good liber-
als. Well, everyone is enti-
tled to a personal opinion,
aren't they? Even if it is
based on complete ignorance.
Even if it does destroy peo-
ple.

We don't think so. A collu-
sion between ignorance and
anxious conformity has perpe-
trated great wickedness upon
real people. And this very
considerable suffering inflic-
ted on anyone who knows or
fears that (s)he is gay is ab-
solutely unnecessary.

We are a group of individu-
als who are concerned about
stopping this human destruc-
tion. No single action will
accomplish the kind of change
in social attitudes that is
necessary. But there are sev-
eral obvious starting points.

First, there are certain po-
litical changes which are es-
sential. NOW is beginning to
compile a mailing list of per-
sons sympathetic to legal
form. If you are willing to

write a few letters to alder-
men, state legislators, etc.,
in favor of altering current
sex laws and of expanding the
coverage of existing human
rights laws, please send us
your address.

Secondly, most people—in-
cluding most liberals—are
quite ignorant of what it
means to be a homosexual in
our society. We strongly
urge all you who call your-
selves liberals, or human-
ists, or feminists—to take
the time to read Lesbian/Wo-
man by Del Martin and Phyllis
Lyon. It is available in
most libraries and paperback
bookstores, or may be ordered
through us.

We are also selling human

rights buttons and are in des-
perate need of contributions.
If you sympathize with us for
whatever reason, please help
us now. Our hour of need is
upon us.

Lesbian Motherhood
Study

Dear Sisters:

I am a graduate student in

the School of Social Work at

California State University,
Sacramento. I am presently
working on my master's thesis.

Lesbian mothers are now en-
gaged in court cases to gain

or regain custody of their
children and are in dire need
of support from many levels.
My hope for this thesis is
that it can be used to streng-
then the arguments and dispel
the negative stereotypes of
Lesbian motherhood, as well
as to increase society's a-
wareness and acceptance of
Lesbians and Lesbian child-
raising.

I have developed a question-
naire in conjunction with Del
Martin and Phyllis Lyon and
other members of the Lesbian
community, which is now ready
for distribution. My popula-
tion of subjects can include
any woman who considers her-
self to be a Lesbian who is
raising or has raised a child
whether or not they are now
living together.

To reach as many women as
possible, I need your help.
Can you announce the exis-
tence of this research to as
many women as possible? Wo-
men who are willing to com-
plete a questionnaire can
drop me a card letting me
know they will participate.

All replies will be held
strictly confidential and re-
sponses will be anonymous and
in no way connected to the
names or addresses of respon-
dents.

Obtaining a large number of

Lesbian mothers for my sample
is crucial to the effective-
ness of my thesis; any publi-
city you can give to this ef-
fort will be critical to its

success and greatly apprecia-
ted.

Thank you very much.

house screened by pine trees,  
a pleasantly decorated blue  
and white living room, femin-  
ist posters on the walls; I  
am immediately suspicious.  
I'm not supposed to feel at  
ease in an employment agency.  

The goals of Feminist For-  
mations are as disconcerting-  
ly healthy as their environ-  
ment. Their standards demand  
that they place skilled women  
in non-traditional, enjoyable  
temporary jobs that pay well.  
Too often, the three founders  
/counselors say, employment  
agencies push a person into  
any job at any pay scale.  
Rarely do they find a suita-  
ble position for an individu-  
al. Lynn McGuigan says they  
hope to place a woman in a  
job where ""her potential will  
come out, not be stashed  
away.""  

In order to do that, they  
must first ascertain what a  
woman's potentials are. They  
find that women often have a-  
bilities they don't know they  
have or experience that  
they undervalue. This is es-  
pecially true of women return-  
ing to the workforce after  
raising a family. A woman may  
not realize the validity of,  
for example, her community or-  
ganizing experience. She may  
be diffident about ""selling  
herself."" Feminist Forma-  
tions, as a go-between with  
the employer, can ""sell"" the  
employee, presenting her in a  
positive manner. ""We don't  
have to tell the employer she  
did it without pay,"" says  
Carol Lee. They can play up  
her qualifications.  

WHAT’S IN A NAME?  

Once they determine what a  
client can do and what she  
would like to do, the next  
step is to find a job to fit

her. This is not as impossi-  
ble as a search-weary woman  
may think. The counselors  
say people have asked them,  
""Isn't the name (Feminist For-  
mations) going to produce all  
kinds of cringes in the bus-  
iness community?"" But they  
maintain the name actually  
saves them time. If an em-  
ployer is turned off by the  
name, they know immediately  
they won't want to place  
their clients there.  

Some firms are very open  
to Feminist Formations;  
Kathleen Sarafolean says  
they're beginning to realize  
they have to hire women, mak-  
ing this a good time to start  
an agency like theirs. Some  
companies are ignorant of the  
women's movement, but after  
talking with Feminist Forma-  
tions, accept their ideas.  
The women feel they further  
the women's movement by mak-  
ing these employers aware,  
and good relationships can u-  
sually be established with  
these first two types. Other  
companies are unmistakably  
anti-feminist. To these, the  
women simply respond, ""Oh,  
I'm sorry you feel that way,""  
and leave.  

Bringing up the subject of  
feminism immediately with em-  
ployers is a fairly efficient  
screening method, but if it  
fails and a client feels she  
has been discriminated  
against, the counselors en-  
courage her to file a legal  
complaint against the company.  
""Oh, yes,"" says Sarafolean,  
""we have a stack of complaint  
forms a foot high.""  

They provide other kinds  
of help for clients; if a wo-  
man decides she needs further  
training or education, Femin-  
ist Formations helps her sec-  
ure information about schools,  
admission requirements, loan  
applications, child care arr-  

decorating.  

THE FUTURE  

They feel that their work  
will also help women in the  
long run. ""Like a bank that  
offers a new service,"" as the  
advantages become apparent,  
the concept will spread. As  
women begin to understand  
that they don't really have  
to accept low-paying, boring  
jobs, they will stop seeking  
that kind. As employers no-  
tice that women have varied  
skills and work well in non-  
traditional temporary jobs,  
they will hire more women.  

As employment agencies see  
the success of this approach  
to employment, more of them  
will adopt it.  

They also hope to raise  
the general pay scale for wo-  
men city-wide by decreasing  
the supply of women who must  
accept low-paying jobs.  

This employment agency is  
revolutionary even in non-fem-  
inist ways. The idea of em-  
ploying ""professionals"" on a  
free-lance or temporary basis  
is not widely practiced. The  
counselors feel that if more  
people worked temporarily,  
they wouldn't get so bored  
with their jobs since they'd  
be gone before the ""honeymoon""  
was over.  

In the month and a half  
that the agency has been in  
operation, its largest areas  
of concentration and therefore  
success have been construction  
and the creative fields--wri-  
ting, advertising, interior  
Women like con-  
struction jobs because they  
pay more than ""women's"" jobs,  
and because, as Lee says,  
""Women are intrigued by the  
idea of spending the whole day  
outside in the sun."" They  
like the physically strength-  
ening activity. Lee says they  
try to send women to construc-  
tion jobs in teams of at least  
two for mutual support in an  
emphatically male situation.  

WOMAN TO WOMAN  

The counselors would like  
to develop a service of suppl-  
ying feminists with feminists.  
For example, many women, they  
believe, would prefer to hire  
women to perform services  
such as plumbing, electrical  
work, accounting, etc. A wo-

GoldFlower,3,1,,3,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No1_page003.txt,"The function of the Feminist Studio Workshop  
is to help women realize their potential as  
creative human beings. In order to do this,  
women must learn to connect with, to draw upon  
and validate their own experience. Through  
study and work women become conscious of their  
historical position as women and to understand  
the range of choices available in this decade.

Not only is the workshop committed to the  
talent of each woman, but we ask each woman to  
extend herself into the community, and to  
commit her energy to changing those values  
that oppress women. We are exploring ways to  
make social change through the work we do. In  
order to encourage a society which is sensitive  
and responsive to the needs and contributions  
of women, the boundaries that have previously  
existed between art-related professions must  
merge. This results in an array of expressive  
choices previously unavailable and encourages  
a new kind of female creator, one who forms  

a self-definition more consistent with her own  
needs than the restricting professional defi-  
nitions of artist, designer, historian, critic,  
as those professions exist in male-dominated  
institutions. It is the intention of the  
Feminist Studio Workshop to develop artists,  
designers, art historians, critics and educa-  
tors who can translate their experience in the  
Workshop into viable alternative professional  
choices. We invite women in all the art-  
related fields to enter the Workshop and use  
our structure to create new choices for them-  
selves and other women.  

Behind us lies the patriarchal  
system; the private house,  
with its nullity, its immoral-  
ity, its hypocrisy, its ser-  
vility. Before us lies the  
public world, the profession-  
al system, with its posses-  
siveness, its jealousy, its  
pugnacity, its greed...  
The question we put to you  

is how can we enter the pro-  
fessions and yet remain  
civilized human beings ...

Degree programs are available in art, art his-  
tory, design and feminist art education,  
through the International Community College.  
The two-year program can constitute either the  
‘last two years of undergraduate study or can  
be adapted to a two-year master's program de-  
pending on the level of the individual woman's  
development. The one-year Critique Program is  
available as an accelerated master's program  
for those women with or without a bachelor's  
degree who have demonstrated a high level of  
consciousness and achievement. Degree pro-  

grams, which cost considerably more than the  
tuition of the Feminist Studio Workshop, can  
be financed through time payment plans and  
loans which can be arranged through the Inter-  
national Community College.  

When a woman artist positively  
identifies herself to us  
through her work, she commits  

a courageous and daring act  

of self-exposure, because her  
contribution has neither spo-  

ken to nor been understood by  
the mainstream of the culture  
and the content of her art  
has been bypassed by inter-  

pretations which could reveal  
it. Thus a woman's saying,  
""I am, I know myself, and I  
feel a fundamental optimism--  
a grasp upon my own survival  
as a model for human survi-  
val,"" is saying something  
which challenges the prevail-  
ing worldview.

skills and could support her-  
self from free-lance jobs  
would have a flexible, autono-  
mous occupation. In this way,  
both workers and customers  
could avoid dealing with an  
agent of the male establish-  
ment: a small step but an im-  
portant concept in creating  

a viable female culture.  

Finding good jobs for wo-  
men, raising employers' con-  
sciousnesses, helping women  
find training, raising the  
average pay scale for women,  
and bypassing male society  
are not the only things these  
women do.  

Every Thursday night they  
conduct workshops for clients  
and employers on topics such  
as ""Employment in a Sexist  
Society,"" ""Open Relation-  
ships,"" and ""Relaxation  
through hypnosis and mind con-  
trol."" They have offered a  
weekend retreat at a northern  
resort, focusing on employ-  
ment but also on ""sisterhood,  
personal growth, development  
and relationships."" They  
sponsor a course in astrology  
and a growing speakers bureau.  

All three women are rais-  
ing and supporting families.  
The cupboard runs a bit bare  
now in the beginning stages  
while they reinvest most of  
their profits in the business.  
But they worry more about  
fighting sexism than about  
where their next meal comes  
from. They take part-time  

jobs to keep themselves going,  
crack jokes about making one  
hotdog feed a family of four,  
and speak with confidence of  
the monumental changes they  
will make in society.  

hands keep wanting to open,  
drift like feathers on your back,  
hold your gaze between my palms,  
brood on your nape,  

pull your hips  

against me.  

I don't know how to think it is  
wrong  
that I keep wanting to open  

to you,

GoldFlower,3,1,,8,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No1_page008.txt,"BLACKWELL FORMS TASK FORCE

On April 2 a new task force of the Elizabeth  
Blackwell Women's Health Center, which is a  
women's health collective dealing mainly  
with educating women through self-help, lo-  
cated in the People's Center, was formed.  
This newly-organized task force is a patient  
advocacy and referral group.

A patient advocate for women is defined as a  
woman willing to accompany another woman to  
a health care facility in order to give her  
support. The group sees itself as mainly  
existing for being advocates for general ex-  
aminations and operations that are minor,  
such as menstrual extractions and vacuum  
aspirator-type abortions, at the moment.  
However, this will be extended as the group  
gains more experience.

Besides patient advocacy, the group is going  
to compile a complete list of referrals for  

the Women's Health Center, listing area doc-  
tors. By doing this, the group hopes to  

by COCO WEBER

supply women with more and better options  
and overall health care. At the moment, the  
are getting together an attitudinal form to  
distribute to the consumers or the patients  
on the quality of treatment they have re-  
ceived.

What is hoped will come out of this is a  
book in which is listed every doctor in the  
metropolitan area. It would also help to  
insure consumer control. The group has been  
contacting the doctors' offices by phone  

as to what their prices and attitudes are,  
what birth control methods they recommend,  
etc. This has not met with a favorable re-  
sponse, and, in some cases, the doctors are  
paranoid about the survey.

Coming out of this would also be patient  
rights. That is, watching legislation rela-  
ting to women's health needs and the bills  
concerning their rights.

GoldFlower,3,1,,9,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No1_page009.txt,"TO KATE.

""Device Piece for Walker-to Kate"" has so  
many elements within it to talk about that I  
have opted for a brief description: as a  
means of encouraging all women out there to  
see the piece or at least be on the alert for  
other works by Carole Fischer, and then I shall  
devote myself to totally subjective feelings  
on the subject.

———

Materials used are brick, glass, red elastic  
and Kotex. As shown in the photo, the materials  
are either balanced or stretched over one an-  
other. Not evident in the photo is the soft  
breeze which plays over the lines of stretched  
elastic.

Now to the subjective area. Obvious vis-  
ual contrasts have been pointed out in other  
reviews; shiny glass against dull bricks, trans-  
parent alongside opaque, hard brick versus soft  
Kotex, etc. Simplistic observations which do  
little justice to the artist's efforts.

Similes and metaphors abound to further  
""explain"" what is happening vis-à-vis the  
Walker's Invitation Catalogue: ""...sheets of  
glass propped against a wall, with taut bands  
of elastic pinned beside them and stretched  
across the floor, allude to gossamer curtains  
on a drying frame.""

Thus we are told that a work which is capable  
of evoking diverse memories and feelings; a  
work which understands the dynamic use of space  
and concrete “earthly” objects to draw us into  
the realm of abstraction essentially comes down  
to gossamer curtains. The woman's experience in  
art?

Carole Fisher with components far Device Piece Series

a review by Margaret Hastings

The catalogue continues. ""For the first  
time socio-political statement is also intro-  
duced in her use of sanitary napkins as an in-  
tegral part of her construction."" In a woman's  
life, Kotex, Tampax, et al. are hardly socio-  
political; they are necessities. It is the  
world's unhealthy reaction to them which brings  
into play the political element. It is also  
easier to dismiss such a reminder of women's  
bodily functions with political clichés than  
express honest reactions. If red elastic  
stretched full length conjures images of cur-  
tains, then certainly the Kotex reminds us of  
menstruation.

Trying to tell you what ""...-to Kate"" is all  
about, what it reminds me of or its political  
intentions would be a bit pretentious. Its  
very strength lies in its unlimited implica-  
tions, ideas and visual imagery. Is the red  
elastic blood? Possibly. Does the glass sig-  
nify fragile prettiness or a sinister quality  
with its sharp cutting edges? Choose one, both  
or neither.

Carole Fisher has taken separate units  
and formed connections of movement, reflection,  
repetition, contradictions—all that stuff one  
learns in art schools. Through such connections  
common, identifiable objects merge into one  
another to express a world outside of their  
limited forms. Louise Nevelson does this in her  
works; good poets use words to the same end.

Gossamer curtains are only a small part of it.

GoldFlower,3,1,,11,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No1_page011.txt,"THEY SAY THAT’S  
WHY WE'RE “i ERE by CHARLOTTE MASTERMAN  

We're sitting in a circle, the eight of us,  
so we can all see and hear each other. The  
brochure about consciousness raising groups  
told us people feel more like talking in a cir-  
cle; it's more intimate. But tonight, like  
always, anxious thrills shoot up my arms, and I  
don't feel any more like spilling what's inside  
me than I did last week or the week before.  
Shiela sits across from me, her eyes blankly  
staring through me. I don't think she'll say a  
thing tonight, either.  

Janet looks like she'll catapult right out of  
her chair if she doesn't talk. So she tells us  
what's hurting her. Her old man left her for  
another woman, she tells us. It blew her mind,  
and she got involved with a man. Now her kids  
despise her. But they still adore the old man.  
She thinks it's unfair. What hurts her most is  
when they call her slut and whore. The others  
try to comfort her with realities that exist  
for them, but not for Janet's kids.  

Maddening jitters begin to creep inside my  
skin when everything goes quiet. I think maybe  
I've had too much coffee today, but I know it's  
not the coffee. Janet's hurt starts mine up,  
and I want to talk and I don't. What's  
broiling under the surface scares the hell out  
of me. But Jennifer saves me having to decide  
if now's the time.  

I watch her as she speaks, and I wonder if  
she wouldn't be kind of pretty without her  
mouth all pinched together like it has a draw-  
string pulled through it. Her feelings spurt  
out like pop-gun fire. Her family's angry with  
her. Says she should snap out of whatever ails  
her, they're tired of her whining after app-  
reciation. Says they'd appreciate her more if  
she didn't constantly remind them. But I won-  
der about that. I wonder if they don't want  
her to shut up so they won't feel guilty. I  
wonder who's screwed up, her or them?  

Gracie pipes up in her wire thin voice, ""He  
says I need help."" She's always saying that,  
but she keeps the rest a secret. My jitters  
are going crazy now. My hair feels like it's  
crawling and I smooth it down hard with my  
palm. I look at Shiela staring at nothing, and  
I wonder where she is.  

I wonder, too, when we're going to get be-  
yond gut-spilling and start helping each other  
somehow. Maybe that's it. Maybe we don't know  
how. Or maybe all the poison has to come out  
first.  

Mellanie's voice booms out with its usual  
energy. She's different from the rest of us,  
not what you'd consider feminine. She's very  
tall and moves like a willow whip, graceful  
and all--but she's got a vibrance that makes  
her look aggressive even when she's sitting  
still. I don't think anyone will ever beat  
her down for long. Seems like she'd just boomerang no matter what.  

She's always been open, right from our first  
meeting. Listening, I wonder with a secret  
smile what tonight's revelation will bring.  

She tops off last week's episode by telling us  
about several suicide attempts. You may think,  
Aha! So they did get to her. But I'm not so  
sure. I wonder if that was Mellanie's way of  
saying, Okay, if there's no place for me and my  
way, screw all of you! She sighs and wears a  
wry smile, ""Damned near made it last time, but  
my goddamned neighbor found me. I could have  
killed her.""  

I envision Mellanie stretched out white and  
dead, her brown eyes lusterless, glaring, and  
something knifes at my insides. I wonder if I  
should tear back the thin tissue that covers  
the burning thing in my gut. I open my mouth,  
but the words won't come. Nobody notices be-  
cause Doris lets loose with a story of how she  
went berserk one day. She even gets me laugh-  
ing. I can picture sweet, docile Doris, who's  
too timid to ask for the salt at supper, hurt-  
ling everything in sight at this guy she's liv-  
ing with, a huge man with lead fists, and him  
peering stupidly at her. ""He slapped me around  
afterward, but it was worth it,"" she relished,  
throwing her head back, cackling and slapping  
her knees, ""oh, man was it worth it!"" Her  
eyes widen and she leans forward, like the  
most important part is coming. “He was scared—  
scared—I could see it in his eyes, you know?  
And that . . . "" she chuckles in between her  
words, "". . . that makes me .. . double over  
and . . . laugh, which makes him,"" she can hard-  
ly talk now she's laughing so hard, “even...  
even madder. He told me... told me I was...'  
nuts. Oh, my stomach . . . someone make me ...,  
stop:"" . By now everyone is giggling loud and  
hard. Doris is holding her stomach, doubled up  
in her chair. When the laughing eases into  
softer, sighing spurts, Gracie chimes in with,  
""He says I need help."" And everyone is sudd-  
enly quiet, like when you snap off a radio, and  
no one laughs at what Gracie says because she  

looks so forlorn.  

Silence creeps in through my pores and pushes  
out 'til I think my skin will burst into a  

million fragments. A warning roars through my  
brain, but I ignore it because it's too late—  
I hear a stranger's hollow voice and I realize  
it's mine "". . . in a commune .. . with lots  
of 'liberated' people—the men were at liberty  
to make all the rules and fight the important  
battles of society with their rhetoric while  
the women were at liberty to do all the shit  
work. Oh, it was equally divided between us.""  
Everyone laughs. ""At first we were like pio-  
neers, you know, making a new utopian society  
and all that, and we didn't complain 'cause our  
mission was so important. But after awhile,  
there were things that stuck out so you couldn't  
ignore them."" My taut skin has little  
spasms, then relaxes a little, while I get my  
bearings. ""We were privileged to gaze up into  

continued on page 11"
GoldFlower,3,1,,12,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No1_page012.txt,"continued from page 10

their bearded faces while they made all the  
important decisions, and we went along like  
sheep—and not one of them worked to speak of,  
only short part-time jobs, and every one of the  
women had work except for two who were pregnant  
and one girl who was sick a lot. Course, they  
were conducting the revolution,"" I say, and we  
all laugh at the picture of a bunch of guys  
sitting around jawing a revolution. ""But the  
women ended up fighting among themselves, like  
we couldn't stick together because we seemed to  
be pitted against each other. Cuz it's always  
been that way? I don't know. I suppose we  
were scared because we thought we were depen-  
dent on them."" I pause a minute so I can get  
something straight in my head, so they'll un-  
derstand. ""That really got me, how we fought  
with each other and how really the men were de-  
pendent on us and we never saw that. But that  
wasn't the worst.""

They're waiting now. Prickles run across my  
scalp. I fight to loosen my throat so I can  
talk. ""Well... I got pregnant. And the  

guy I was living with... in the commune, you  
know, there were all couples... he has a fit,  
yells at me asking how I could let that hap-  
pen, and I say I didn't use artificial insem-  
ination, but he doesn't think that's funny,  
just stands there screaming at me. I say I  
want us to get out and live alone. He won't  
hear of it and when I push him about this he  
lets it out that he doesn't want to live with  
me any more, not anywhere. I ask him shouldn't  
he be responsible for his own child? Then he  
lays it on me..."" I see his flushed,  
twisted face, ugly now, not beautiful like it  
was when I first knew him, and the burning in  
my stomach shoots up between my ribs. ""He tells  
me it isn't his kid, and I don't know what to  
say I'm so shocked, I can't believe my ears. I  
ask him how he can even think that, and he says  
with all the men in the place how does he know,  
and I say with all the women in the place does  
that mean he's been playing around? And he  
won't answer, just sits there, starts his pout-  
ing.""

I can't control my shivers now, nor my voice’  
erratic up and down swings, ""I find out later  
he did get it on with several of the women—  
after all the love and honesty shit he spouted!  
I stuck with him cuz I didn't know what else to  
do. I figured he'd have to want his kid once  
he was over the shock. But finding out about  
him and the others, that was too much. I con-  
front him with it and you won't believe what  
he says—he says ‘It's a free world, isn't it?'  
And that's the excuse he used to get out of  
claiming our baby, said he was free to accept  
or reject it, and besides, he still wasn't  
sure it was his. He says all these things and  
I can't believe anything's real, that I'm hear-  
ing all this, and I feel like I'm going nuts,  
everything I put my faith in believed in  
- + » all disappearing like the world is a mir-  
age and nothing solid... ""My heart is  
drumming wildly in my ears. I'm sure they're  
going to pop. I don't see anyone in front of  
me, everything blurred, wavering, like in one  
of those horror house mirrors. I feel cold  
drops slip down the valley of my breasts. My  
ears ring and I hear someone screaming, ""You  
lousy sonofabitch how can you reject your own  
baby? You! You say you cherish life and here  
you are trying to save a sick society and you  
can forget you made a life and what about  
that life?""

Everyone is gaping at me and I clam up and  
breathe hard to stop the beating in my ears.  
That crazy Gracie says, ""He says I need help,""  
and I think I'm going to scream. But I wait  

holding my breath cuz they're sitting there  
gawking at me, not unkindly, just the way  
people do when they're embarrassed.

I try to calm my voice but it tilts up, ""Well  
when I have my baby they say I have to  
give it up.""

Someone gasps, ""Why?""

""Because I killed him."" There, it's out now,  
the poison, and I can say it with a steel edge  
because now I'm empty inside and don't feel  
anything. ""I stuck a knife in his gut. I did-  
n't think about it, just did it. And I'm not  
sure I wouldn't do it again, except I want my  
baby."" I try to tell them after I get out of  
here I'll go to prison, but the words won't  
come. Instead I see him again—astonished,  
grasping spurting blood, rasping, ""Bitch!  
Bitch!"" These were his last words.

The lights blink, warning us it's time to  
break. We avoid each other's eyes. Doris takes  
Gracie's arm, leading her like you would a  
small child and they head for the hallway that  
leads to gray dormitories and iron cots.

I stay, because Sheila's trembling.  
I put my arms around her.  
She lays her head on my chest, whimpering.

I say, “I know, I know.  
It'll be all right."" But I know it won't be  
all right. They've told her she'll never get  
out of here if she doesn't adjust. She's terr-  
ified of that, and I know she won't sleep and  
I'll sit up with her tonight.

Gracie's short soliloquy carried through the  
hallway—""He says I need help."" Doris soothes  
her, ""Sure, Gracie, I know. They say that's  
why we're here.""

Another aspect of the group is to gather in-  
formation regarding needed services and a-  
vailable training women can receive now and  
in the future and what is available outside  
Minneapolis. Here is included doctors doing  
research into new gynecological and O.B.  
techniques.

The two main groups of the task force are the  
advocacy and referral groups. The advocacy  
group is, at the present time, trying to  

find out which clinics in the area are favor-  
able to their cause and will allow them to  
accompany women while they are receiving  
treatment. They are concentrating mainly on  
menstrual extractions, vacuum aspirator  
abortions and D and C-type abortions, as far  
as accompanying women goes, until they have  
more expertise. There has already been a  
meeting with a counselor at the University  
of Minnesota Hospital's North Clinic, where  
abortions are performed. The response to  
advocacy there was favorable.

Though still in the process of becoming, the  
task force wishes to gain skills for itself  
in women's health care and learn how to  
share these skills and knowledge with other—  
women. For more information, or to volunteer  
information, call the Elizabeth Blackwell  
Women's Health Center, 335-7669.

It is also planned to match women in rap  
groups and on a one-to-one basis regarding  
similar experiences with health care. These  
groups would be a support-type facility."

IS REVOLUTIONARY  

by Jan Jirak  

Caravan Dance Collective has no director,  
the dancers do the administrative work them-  
selves, and teachers have been heard to say,  

""This is a collective. I can make mistakes.""  
If this does not sound like a typical dance  
studio to you, you're right. It was formed  
precisely to avoid the hassles of “typical  
dance studios.""  

For many Caravan members, it was a case of  
the art institution turning artists away from  
art. Sue Halloran, for example, had studied  
dance for many years, but stopped dancing be-  
cause of the competitiveness in traditional  
dance establishments. ""Every time I got out on  
the dance floor, I felt tight and rigid,"" and  
finally developed ulcerative colitis. After  
teaching school for a short time, she found  
Caravan, and is now dancing, teaching dance,  
and choreographing again.  
""We don't try to make our bodies conform to  
some rigid standard,"" says Lois Weeks, who  
teaches belly dancing and body awareness. She  
feels that dance should explore the possibili-  
ties of the body.  

The dancers represent a wide variety of  
training and experience, ranging from Linda  
Shapiro who studied all technique with no im-  
provisation; to Halloran who studied only im-  
provisation. Their interests range from modern  
dance to East Indian dance to Afro-Jazz.  

Caravan says it is the community and schools."" Usually this takes  
the form of dance classes held in their studio  
at 330 N. Prior in St. Paul and taught by mem-  
bers of the collective. But the collective al-  
so teaches classes to groups in the community.  
Usually these experiences add to the dancers'  
perceptions of dance. For example, Halloran  
and Dena taught a class at the Women's School.  
They found that almost all the women disliked  
some part of their bodies. They studied the  
movement of the bodies in different situations.  
They assumed aggressive and passive roles and  
found that roles affected how they moved.  

In Lois Weeks' body awareness class, stu-  
dents paired off to do relaxation exercises  
with each other. Weeks said the women were  

""What makes a bully?” from ""Dancing Playground""  

very unwilling to touch each other, giggled,  
wouldn't concentrate. As Dena says, ""You have  
to open yourself to be touched."" Women are not  
trained for that in this society.  

Dance for children is a major focus at Cara-  
van. The major work the collective performed  
last year was ""Dancing Playground.”  

""Balloon Dance"" from ""Dancing Playground""  

explores every aspect of a playground from the  
physical objects (""Seesaw"", ""Merry-Go-Round"")  
to dynamics in the group (""What makes a bully?"" and  
space, time and energy (the three elements of  
dance) relationships between dance and language,  
dance and mathematics, and the related skills of  
reading, writing, and computing.”  

Some of the teachers also teach dance classes  
in elementary schools, exploring these same  
elements of movement. Elementary school teach-  
ers are often amazed at the concentration the  
children display in their approach to dance.  

Artistic commitment is intrinsically politi-  
cal for women. As women who take classes at  
Caravan become more committed to it, this be-  
comes a source of strife with their husbands.  
Diane Mostek recalls that it was OK with her  
husband for her to be dancing as long as it was  
a hobby, but when it became a commitment, he was  
opposed to it.  

Linda Shapiro sees the problem from a differ-  
ent angle. She finds that it is very important  
to her to be self-supporting. Now that she has  
stopped teaching and is dancing full-time, she  
wants to make Caravan a ""going thing."" ""I don't  
want this to be my little plaything that he lets  
me do because it makes me happy.""  

Several Caravan women are interested in ex-  
ploring the relationship between dance and their  
personal politics. They think, for one thing,  
that many of society's problems would be solved  
if people felt freer with their bodies. In  
other words, if you're not uptight about your  
body, you're less likely to be uptight about  
other things. They believe that a person who  
is “uncentered""—physically, emotionally, spir-  
itually—can be dangerous if in a position of  
power; and that there are a lot of uncentered  
people in power.  

""Anyway,"" said one member, ""dance makes you  
happy—and being happy is revolutionary.""  

""Mr. Temptation"" Its purpose is to ""explore"

BY MARY HASTINGS

""Bending the twig"" can be a distressing
prospect if parents want their daughters and
sons to grow up free of stifling sex
role stereotypes. But some Twin Cities in-
stitutions do offer activities for children
that can strengthen them and free them from
sex role bigotry. Following are results of
an admittedly selective survey of Twin Cit-
ies agencies; the activities listed tend to
appeal to very young children and most are
recreational. Charges, if any, are indica-
ted (Welfare subsidy is also indicated).

DANCE CHOREOGRAM: 725-4th St. S.E.,
Mpls. (Dinkytown area), 331-8563. Starting
September 19 Choreogram will offer dance
classes for boys and girls ages 6 - 12.
2:30 p.m. Tuesdays, 9:30 a.m. Saturdays.
$25 for series of 12 lessons, reduced rates
for families enrolling more than one child.
(Call to discuss possible special arrange-
ments in cases of financial need.)

CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER: 406 E. 48th
St., Mpls., 823-5261. The center is basic-
ally a resource center and library for
parents and day care workers, concentrating
on pre-school children. Its services are
available to anyone in the metropolitan
area. The center offers literature, files
on day care regulations, help with funding,
help with curricula. The center has a model
play area for people to investigate and
conducts workshops for parents and day-care
workers in such areas as infant stimulation
and nutrition.

August workshops will treat learning and
behavior problems of children. Register
as soon as possible; a $2 fee is charged.

Every Thursday in August the center will
hold “kids' activity days"" from 1 to 3 p.m.
Parents can bring their children if they
call at least 24 hours in advance. The
days will include: plant day, mobile making
day, paint day, clay day and water play
day. There is no charge for these activi-
ties.

YWCA: 1130 Nicollet Ave., Mpls., 332-0501.
Following is the Y's statement on non-
sexist education and a listing of activi-
ties for pre-schoolers:

""The philosophy of non-sexist, non-racist
education for pre-schoolers is now in op-
eration in many YWCA programs.

""All YWCA instructors I spoke with indica-
ted that non-sexist education was attitud-
inal. Most children between the ages of
3 and 6 have yet to determine sex roles and
will therefore try and do anything their
friends do. Likewise, if instructors en-
courage both boys and girls to do every-
thing children do not develop a ""must not”
attitude about their various activities, at
least, not in the school situation.

“Some examples of non-sexist educational
tools include play activities, books and
discussion. The YWCA Nursery School has
an open environment which includes trucks,
dolls, a play house with dress-up clothes,
and a miniature kitchen where kids learn to
cook. The teachers encourage the kids to be
come involved in all aspects of the facility.
It is not unusual to see little girls play-
ing with trucks in the sand or boys play-
ing with dolls.

""Books are very important educational
tools to young children. All YWCA pre-
school educators select special non-sexist
reading material. ""William's Doll"" was a
favorite with the children last spring.

The attitude being that it is just as im-
portant that boys learn to be good fathers
through play acting with dolls as it is for
girls to learn about motherhood.

GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA: This very tra-
ditional organization will begin counsel-

roaches to sex roles this fall. Although
there are unfortunate aspects to this
organization, it might be worthwhile to
check into these counseling groups in the
fall. Call: 338-0721.

MPLS. PUBLIC SCHOOLS: Every parent must
investigate her or his child's school to
discover possible non-sexist recreational
activities. (It is the writer's opinion
that the schools are not completely sin-
cere in their stated commitment to affirm-
ative action and non-sexist education.)

information.

""Lois Milbauer, pre-school instructor for
South Suburban, purchases most of her in-
structional material from the Emma Willard
Task Force on Equal Education and Learning
Book Store, endorsed by N.O.W.

""The University Branch YWCA was funded
last year to study the issue of sexism.
University of Minnesota students visited
the nursery school and played association
games with the children to determine what
areas sexist attitudes are strong and to
encourage non-sexism. The students would
mention a specific task, like ironing,
and ask the kids who can iron. If the
children indicated that this task was
specifically for moms, a discussion would
ensue.

""Non-sexist education is a relatively
new concept in YWCA programming but its
importance has been realized and we hope
to incorporate this type of training in
parent education classes as well as in
pre-school classes sometime this fall.""

Flying, by Kate Millett, (Alfred A. Knopf,  
546 pages, hardcover, $8.95).

Reviewed by Susan W. Plaster

I applaud Kate Millett's just-released  
autobiographical work, Flying. During the  
days I was reading it, Flying took up most  
of my time and mindspace: I sat down to try  
to write in my own journal and all my sen-  
tences came out like Millett's. Flying is a  
powerful analysis of a person, a way of  
living, and a movement.

Flying is largely about Millett's life  
during the past few years, but much is told  
of her previous life including her St. Paul  
Catholic childhood. The format is that of  
undated journal entries. The chronological  
scrambling bothered me at first but really is  
appropriate because it is roughly comparable  
to the way most of us mentally inhabit  
several time zones at once. The book chron-  
icles a period of great growth in Millett's  
life, a return from a mental precipice on  
which she found herself a few years ago.

Flying becomes a book-within-a-book as  
Millett tells of the agonies undergone while  
writing it and of friends' reactions to parts  
she shared with them. How many authors are  
courageous to share with their readers their  
insecurities about their work? The book  
involved me deeply in its progress. Millett  
asks, ""Can I finish this book? What if my  
friends are offended? Should I tell every-  
thing?"" Midway through the book I was  
trapped, feeling myself more participant than  
reader.

Millett's writing about her family is  

particularly striking. Her use of verbatim  
accounts of conversations is especially  
effective in her talks with her mother.  
""What do you mean, bisexual,"" Mrs. Millett's  
voice asks over the phone, and as Kate jumps  
into the unknown and tries to explain, she is  
breaking that granite barrier of parent-child  
dishonesty about sexuality.

WORTH READING!

The word ""radical"" and how it might apply  

to Kate Millett. A dead horse by now, the  
word used to be defined as “one who analyzes  
and attempts to change the roots of a prob-  
lem."" Radical has to do with roots and  
causes, not just symptoms. The word roots  
relates to Kate Millett's radicalism in that  
Flying tells much about her roots as a person.  
Instead of trying to totally deny parts of  

her past or separate herself from family  
members who are critical of her, Millett  
writes about her past and those people with  
an attitude of acceptance. She delineates  

in Flying the roots of her sexual and polit-  
ical beliefs. She doesn't omit embarrassing  
or unhip things she may have done: in a  
radical sense, she is honest about herself  
and her roots.

A crucial political confrontation de-  
scribed in the book is Millett's speech at  
Columbia when she is challenged by Teresa  
Juarez to say she is ""lesbian,"" not  
""bisexual."" Millett says:

The line goes, inflexible  
as a fascist edict, that  

bisexuality is a copout.

Yes, I said yes, I am a  

Lesbian.  
Reading these pages over I was shattered  
to realize that Millett succumbed to the  
pressure of a political line and ended up  
making a statement which didn't reflect her  
life truthfully. Flying portrays beauti-  
fully Millett's love alliances with women  
and with her husband Fumio. Bisexuality  
may not be politically ""cool"" but after  
reading Flying I don't think ""lesbian"" tells  
the whole truth about Kate Millett.

A major theme in Flying is the pressure  
Millett felt after skyrocketing to fame with  
the publication of her dissertation, Sexual  
Politics. She discusses the anxieties of  
being recognized by strangers, of being  
expected to speak for all feminists, of  
having the media titillated by her sex life.  
Millett is constantly getting into predica-  
ments because the women's movement's anti-  
leadership stance conflicts with the media's  
hunger for names and faces, and also because  
there are obvious times when a person wants  
and deserves credit for her work. Her  
decision to list herself as director of the  

film Three Lives is discussed in the light  
of that conflict.

Flying introduced me to the people of  
Kate Millett's life--her lovers, family,  
friends, and her critics. Millett's talks  
with Jill Johnston, a memorable tea with  
Doris Lessing, her remarks about Yoko Ono,  
provided me with insights into famous women  
through another famous woman's eyes. Con-  
versely, Millett's record of her stay in  
London with Paul and Nell was the sort of  
ordinary humdrum scrambled-eggs-for-dinner  
picture I enjoy getting of such a person.

BY

Jacob and his mother took an early morn-
ing stroll through an uninhabited part of
the island that was the family's summer re-
treat. His four-year-old curiosity prompted
a steady flow of questions about the new won-
ders entering his world. He skipped light-
ly, smiling, pointing, asking, listening.
Twice he asked apprehensively, ""We don't
have to go back yet, do we?"" His mother's
face tensed. She answered, ""No, not yet.”

He stopped suddenly, let go of his moth-
er's hand, and stooped by a clump of wild
flowers. The sun shining on his face high-
lighted the baby down that made his skin
like creamy satin and his auburn curls lus-
trous and soft. His eyes sparkled and an
""O-o-o-h"" rounded his dusky lips. He was
about to put a dimpled forefinger on a
large monarch butterfly when his mother gen-
tly cautioned him, “No, Jacob, don't touch
him. He has powder on his wings. If you
brush the powder off, he won't be able to
fly and he'll die. We don't want that, do
we?""

He whispered, ""Oh, no. He's pretty.""

Satiated, the monarch fluttered its wings
and disappeared. Jacob giggled. ""Where's
he going, mother?""

All the way back to the cabin, Linda Ev-
erett answered Jacob's questions. But
when the cabin came into view, he became
silent. He pulled back to inspect some
weeds. He searched for something to say a-
bout the nondescript mass before him. At
length Linda took his hand in hers. ""Come
on, Jacob. Aren't you hungry?""

Jacob didn't answer. He scratched at
his ear and submitted meekly to the end of
his glorious morning.

Bill Everett stood in the doorway stretch-
ing and yawning. ""Hi, Tiger,"" he boomed to
Jacob, ""about time you're getting back. I
thought you'd taken off on me."" He tousled
Jacob's hair.

Jacob wore a tight smile. He scooted in-
side, scooped up his pull-toy duck, and
settled himself on a step stool in the
corner of the kitchen to inspect the mech-
anism that made the duck quack.

Linda started bacon frying and began
whipping eggs in a bowl. Bill flopped into
a chair. He thrummed his fingers on the
porcelain table top and stared out the win-
dow. He seemed to address himself to the
trees outside. “Thought we were all here to-
gether."" Linda didn't answer. ""A guy could
starve to death,"" he added.

Linda sighed and muttered, ""Which of those
do you want me to defend first?""

Jacob stirred on his stool and worked the
duck's mouth up and down--rack-rack-rack!

""Stop that, Jacob!"" The sharpness in his
mother's voice startled him. He hung his
head and poked absently at the duck's gar-
ish orange bill.

Bill threw a sharp look at Linda. ""Do
you have to pick on the kid? Don't bitch
at him just because you're in a rotten mood!

CHARLOTTE MASTERMAN

Linda's jaws tightened. Through clenched
teeth she asked, ""Is it all right for Jacob
and I to enjoy the early morning together?
Or,"" she bowed slightly in Bill's direction,
""should we sit in silent awe waiting for
his highness to arise? As for breakfast,""
she sent the eggs spluttering into hot
grease, ""I assume you're not entirely ig-
norant about cooking. If you do have troubl-
e, there's a cookbook on the counter top.""

Bill snarled, ""That'll be the day!"" He
grabbed yesterday's paper and snapped it
open, reading furiously.

Jacob looked furtively at both his par-
ents, then hunched over his toy. He hummed
softly to it.

They ate breakfast in silence. Jacob
spread his eggs over his plate so that it
would look as if he'd eaten most of them.

He slipped a piece of bacon into his jeans
pocket to be disposed of later. Quietly,
he slipped out the kitchen door to retreat
to his sandbox. He scooped a big mound of
wet sand together and patted it into a dome.
He tried to square it off, but his hands
would not obey his directions. Frustrated,
he hammered the sand into a soggy, shape-
less mass. The cool morning breeze carried
harsh voices from the cabin to the sand-
box. Jacob drooped his eyelids and ran a
listless finger through the sand.

Bill emerged from the cabin in swimming
trunks and yelled, ""Hey, Tiger, how about a
swim?""

Jacob's eyes brightened. “Mommy too?""

""Nope. Just us men. I'll race you.""

Get your suit on and

Jacob wrinkled his nose and tugged at one
ear. He opened his mouth to speak. But
when he saw a familiar look on his father's
face that signaled both a little warning
about saying no and the vague, helpless
feeling about answering the question of Why
not?, he changed his mind and went to put
on his trunks.

Bill perched Jacob on his shoulders and
ran to the beach and into the water. Jacob
locked his arms tightly around Bill's neck
and let out gleeful shrieks as the cool
water drenched them both. Bill pulled Jacob
through the water by his hands, Jacob pro-
pelling his feet wildly and sputtering like
a motor. ""Brrrrrmmmm--I'm a boat, Daddy,
I'm a boat!"" he laughed.

Bill supported Jacob's tummy with his
large hand while Jacob's arms and legs
beat at the water. When Bill let go, Jacob
began to sink. Bill pulled him up quickly
and tickled him so he wouldn't cry. Bill's
laugh echoed off the lake mixed with Jac-
ob's light, tinkling giggle. He threw Jac-
ob high over his head and held out his arms
to catch him. Jacob caught his breath. His
mouth turned downward, a terrified ha ha
ha erupting as he descended and bounced into
Bill's arms. He clutched at Bill--""No,
Daddy, don't do that!""

Bill nestled Jacob's head under his chin.  
""Okay, Tiger. Sorry,"" he said.

On the beach they covered themselves with  
sand. Bill closed his eyes and whispered,  
""This is nice."" Jacob did the same, echoing  
""This is nice."" He peeked at Bill periodically  
and closed his eyes again until Bill  
finally rose to leave. Jacob jumped up and  
slipped his hand into Bill's. He looked  
like Bill's miniature, his shoulders drooping  
a bit, his hips thrust slightly forward.  
They ambled lazily, in no hurry to return  
to the cabin.

That night Jacob's velvety fingers on  
Linda's arm awakened her. ""Mommy, I'm  
hot.""

She clasped his hand and ran her fingers  
over his cheek. ""My God, you are hot!""  
she cried. ""Come on, baby,"" she said and  
lifted him into her arms. She laid him on  
the bed next to Bill, who peered into the  
darkness and asked foggily, ""What's wrong?""

Linda tried to control the edge on her  
voice. ""He's probably burned to a crisp.  
You know he burns easily."" She flicked on  
a small light, shot from the bedroom, and  
returned a moment later with a thermometer.  
It registered Jacob's temperature at 103°.

Jacob watched Linda through listless, red-  
rimmed eyes for a sign of his well-being.  
She bit her lower lip and pinched her brows  
tightly together as she laid cold cloths  
to his forehead and arms. She gave him  
cold water and aspirin that were hard to  
swallow. She carried him to his room and  
rocked him, cradling him snugly and hum-  
ming softly.

She felt Jacob's hot breath on her neck  
when he whispered, ""Sing Jacob's song,  
Mommy.""

Linda smiled, hugging him closer. Her  
voice intoned the words she'd given the  
song when Jacob was an infant. She'd used  
it often to lullaby him to sleep. Jacob  
smiled wistfully as she finished--""  
...Daddy's love and Mommy's love, make a  
pretty Jacob.""

Linda laid him on his bed and drew a  
sheet over him, tucking it around his shoul-  
ders. She promised he'd feel much better  
by morning and returned to her room.

But Jacob floated in a burning abyss for  
three days. Whenever he surfaced he felt  
his bed enclosing his heated body and saw  
the ceiling recede and become small and  
distorted. Strange high sounds rang in  
his ears and mixed with voices. The voices  
drifted elusively, shouting fragments  
through filters that made them fuzzy and  
far away. They rose and fell, growing in  
intensity, sharpening their edges, cutting  
through the waves of mist that washed over  
Jacob's mind--A damned lie!--Is it? You  
used to--always bitching!--shut up! shut  
up! You'll disturb Jacob--look who's talk-  
ing--if you cared--then leave!--all right,  
I will!

A deafening roar drew a curtain of sil-  
ence over the voices. The abrasive heat  
that had tightened Jacob's skin over aching  
bones receded, leaving him suspended in a  
numb void.

When he emerged he peered into a wrink-  
led, kindly face. The stranger greeted  
Jacob with a smile. He placed a stethoscope  
on Jacob's chest and appeared to be sleep-  
ing. Then he looked at Jacob and moved his  
lips silently. He frowned slightly and  
moved his lips again. Jacob stared at  
the man hovering over him.

Linda's drawn face appeared on top of  
the man's shoulder. She said voiceless  
things he could not understand.

Jacob slid in and out of sleep while the  
sun made its slow journey behind drawn  
shades. The room was semi-dark when Bill's  
face appeared over him. He wore a look  
much like Linda's, and he, too, moved his  
mouth mutely. Jacob frowned and stared at  
his father.

Each day Jacob sat up in his bed for long-  
er periods. He watched silent gray and  
black figures move across the television  
screen, or lethargically moved wooden puz-  
zle pieces into their slots. He turned  
pages of colorful characters with meaning-  
less black letters next to them. He watched  
his parents' faces for some explanation,  

but could only read confusion and pain.

Had he done something wrong? He watched  
them watching him, and wondered what he  
should do, for their anxious, expectant  
faces told him that he had not done some-  
thing they expected from him. He watched  
them watch each other, their lips moving  
inaudibly, their faces etched with looks  
Jacob attached to the voices he vaguely  
remembered.

Linda began taking him outside on warm  
days. Sometimes she would push him on his  
swing. Sometimes he built awkward squares  
in the sand. And sometimes he dragged his  

linger through flattened sand, tracing two  

tall stick figures with their oversized  
circle-hands stuck to the smaller ones of  
the short figure between them.

One day Linda found him by a clump of  
wild flowers. She knelt down in front of  
him, about to reach out to touch his arm.  
She drew back, stifling a cry with her hand.  
Jacob's fingers methodically tore at the  
legs, the feelers, the wings, of a large  
monarch. His expressionless face rippled  
before Linda's eyes as she heard his mono-  
tone words, the first he'd uttered since his  
illness--""…Daddy's love and Mommy's  
love, make a pretty Jacob.""

JUNGLE ROT EXPOSED!  

New AT&T Agreement Gives $30-million to  
Women and Minorities. 25,000 managerial  
employees (most of them women) will share  

an estimated $30-million in back pay and fu-  
ture salary adjustments under a new agree-  
ment between AT&T, the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S.  
Department of Labor and Justice. The agree-  
ment, which was entered as a consent decree  
in U.S. District Court May 30, is the second  
multi-million dollar settlement of discrimi-  
nation charges against the nation's largest  
private employer in a little more than a  
year. The earlier decree, which covered  
non-management employees, was entered in  
January, 1973.  

KKK  

The 10-year-old Federal Equal Pay Act was  
upheld in its first test before the U.S.  
Supreme Court. In a 5-3 decision, the high  
Court ruled that Corning Glass Works viola-  
ted the Act by paying male inspectors on the  
night shift more than women doing the same  
work in the daytime . . . The decision is  
expected to cost the Corning Glass Works at  
least $600,000 in back pay for women workers  
at three plants.  

KKK  

Rutgers Will Pay For Discrimination. 210  
women and minority faculty members at Rut-  
gers University will share $375,000 in back  
pay and salary adjustments in the largest  
‘compensatory settlement ever made by any  
university in the nation. The salary in-  
creases will put 186 women and 24 minority  
men on a par with their white male colleag-  
ues--in some cases retroactively to 1969.

Employment Briefs. The Iowa-Illinois Gas  

and Electric Company faces a charge by the  
U.S. Department of Labor that the utility is  
in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Act  
for paying women less than men doing sub-  
stantially the same work . . . Eastex, Inc.  
will give 137 women and minority employees  
$257,000 in back pay under a consent decree  
obtained by the Labor Department in resolu-  
tion of a suit charging Eastex with discri-  
mination in hiring, transfers and promotions.  
An additional $67,200 will also be paid in  
bonuses to 56 women transferring to other  
jobs . . . According to a recent report by  
the Washington, D.C. Commission on the  
Status of Women, the number of women in top  
D.C. government jobs decreased sharply between  
1968 and 1972 and even more markedly in some  
very high grades since then. The report  
showed that women holding positions in the  
GS 16-18 range fell from 14% of the work-  
force in 1968 to 8.3% in 1972. Current sta-  
tistics show no women holding GS 17 or 18  
jobs in the city government ... The New  
York State Division of Human Rights has  
found “probable cause"" in its investigation  

of a complaint filed by the Suffolk chapter  
of the National Organization for Women

If you're concerned about our younguns and  
their continuing daily bath in educational  

sexism, read the following--and WRITE.  

HEW Finally Issues Title IX Regulations. The  
Department of Health, Education and Welfare  
has finally published proposed regulations  
for interpretation and enforcement of Title  
IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972.  
The regulations are designed to particularize  
the general anti-sex discrimination stipula-  
tion of Title IX which says that ""No person  
in the United States shall, on the basis of  
sex, be excluded from participation in, be  
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to  
discrimination under any education program  
or activity receiving Federal financial as-  
sistance.""  

Generally, the regulations call for equal  
access and participation by both sexes in  
course offerings, extracurricular activi-  
ties and provision and use of facilities.  

In athletics, which has been a hotly de-  
bated area of the regulations, the proposed  
guidelines fall far short of requiring equal  
expenditure for teams and instruction for  
both men and women. The regulations state  
that ""equal aggregate expenditures are not  
required."" Requirements for equal travel  
and per-diem allowances which appeared in  
earlier versions of the regulations have  
been dropped and the status of athletic  
scholarship requirements remains unclear.  

Ann Scott, legislative vice president of  

the National Organization for Women (NOW)  
commented that HEW's approach ""will encour-  
age segregation of athletic teams."" Dis-  
couraging integration of teams, Ms. Scott  
continued, ""is tantamount to passing pro-  
tective legislation--girls will go on think-  
ing they're inferior to boys and schools  
will continue to treat them that way.""  

HEW has also excluded sexism and sex-stereo-  
typing in textbooks and curriculum from  
their regulations on the grounds that their  
inclusion ""would raise grave constitutional  
questions under the First Amendment.""  

Public hearings on the regulations will be  
held in twelve cities during the next six  
weeks; in addition, written comments can be  
submitted to the Secretary of Health, Educa-  
tion and Welfare until October 15, after  
which final guidelines will be issued. The  
Spokeswoman urges women to write to Secre-  
tary Weinberger and comment. Complete  
copies of the regulations can be obtained  
from the Office of Civil Rights, Dept. of  
Health, Education and Welfare, Washington,

GoldFlower,3,3,AUGUST 1974,8,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No3_page008.txt,"Te Our Sisters —

Girls Are Equal Too: The Women's Movement
for Teenagers, by Dale Carlson (Atheneum,
146 pages, hardcover, $6.25).

“A liberated woman is a woman who thinks
of herself as a human being; who thinks of
herself as an individual with her own inter-
ests and abilities . . . Above all, a liber-
ated woman is a woman who believes she has
the same right to choose what she will do
with her life as a man does and to take the
same responsibility for her life as a man
does.""

Only love for our younger sisters could
have motivated Dale Carlson's book--her wish
for them to have real rather than supposed
choices. Carlson takes us from childhood
through college/altar/job (or all three),
exposing in rapid-fire succession sex-role
stereotyping with its damage to female self
image. As she shows how we are systematical-
ly categorized for no other reason than that
we are female, she builds our confidence in
ourselves as human beings, challenging us to
claim for ourselves all the rights and
choices open to males. For self-hatred is
perhaps the biggest struggle woman faces in
her struggle for a full existence.

While Carlson's book is addressed to teen-
agers, it is an excellent ""crash course"" for
anyone of any age. I know of no other femi-
nist book that concentrates so much into so
little space, and yet is comprehensive with-
out being at all patronizing or simplistic.
While some of the young women in my seventh
grade classes found other feminist books
hard to understand because of references,
allusions, or vocabulary unfamiliar to them,
they found Carlson's book easy to relate to.
And they loved it:

Carlson places myth next to fact as she
traces sex-role stereotyping that casts
women into roles of stupid, inferior, ador-
able, passive, dependent ""little girls.""
(Even at eighty you're still one of the
""girls!"") If it weren't for Carlson's wry
humor, her quick pace, and her challenge to
intellect, we might be tempted to toss the
book aside, for the truth of her statements
is painful to face.

By junior high school we are aware that
""boys don't want any competition from you.
All you have to be from here on in is sexy
enough to catch one of them. Never mind the
books now, the good marks, the basketball
practice. Concentrate on makeup, miniskirts,
and man-catching facial expressions."" (Ever
observe the girls' lavatory between classes?)
Education plays a heavy hand in the pattern-
ing process--girls are automatically placed
in home ec, boys in shop; the schools ""just
seem to assume that all boys have more talent
for electronics, mechanical drawing, machine
parts (not true; girls' aptitudes have been
tested and are just as good as boys'); and
that all girls are just fascinated with
chocolate pudding, needlepoint, and diaper-
ing doll bottoms (false!)."" Boys are encour-
aged from toddlers to explore; their world
expands and widens. But girls are increas-
ingly protected until their only ""proper""
role is that of somebody's wife and mother--
all their satisfactions supposedly come
through others, while boys discover and
create their own.

Carlson tells why women acquiesce to this
programming: ""Girls .. . learn to value
themselves only if other people love and
value them. In the beginning a little girl
looks to her parents for approval and love,
then she looks to her teachers; eventually,
as she grows up, she transfers her need for
approval to boys. Most girls never learn to
look to themselves, to rely on their own
achievements to make them feel important.
So girls go on playing up to boys because
they can't afford to lose their only source
of love. They have so little self-love to
go on.""

In Part One several remarkably condensed
chapters deal with discrimination in college
and employment, women's media image, mar-
riage, divorce, child care, abortion, hous-
ing, credit, women and the arts, legal
rights, the beauty game (and who profits
from it--cosmetics, fashion houses, etc.),
""neurosis"" redefined, and the myth of house-
work as total fulfillment. Carlson does not
deliver a philippic against men and marriage
but treats sexism on a cultural rather than
a personal basis. But given our condition-
ing, honest, open relationships are all but
impossible. She stresses full human growth
and independence as a prerequisite for
healthy, realistic love to survive.

Part Two gets at the origins of sexism,
its worldwide perpetuation by law, religion,
and custom; women's (lack of) education,
their physical abuse, selling of women for
marriage or slavery, and popular myths that
persist to this day. The section on the
early feminist movement thrills us with
""Ain't I a Woman?"" and the Seneca Falls
Declaration. Carlson covers the fifty
years' silence, the depressing fifties
(Back to the Cave!), and the civil rights
movement of the sixties that led, much like
the fight for abolition, to women's renewed
fight for their rights. Included is a list
ing of a few women's rights organizations
that have emerged from the new feminism."

With assurance kindled by

Gold tears on a tremble ride

Fallow tears spill down the ache,  
she gives them to the sky

Only the lunar flame survives.

I see you, my sisters,  
standing accused, forever convict  
in a death house self designed.  
Be no docile thing  
struggling to recover  
the innocence of lost years.  
You are  
the emancipated daughters  
of mother earth.  
The blooms of spring  
long buried by winter's lurid wish  
are restored to new awareness.  

And you shall stand naked, a dance."

by Cheryl Trulen

The denial tale  
The bar fogged by smoke and shaded by  
Tiffany lamps acts as the check out  
counter for copulation. On one side  
of the foam rubber bar sit the cats—  
older ones in prim grey suits while  
the younger sport bells. Their blood-  
shot eyes eagerly survey the vulnerable  

prey—eyeing especially the frontal  
projections.  

On the other side of the screwdriver the  
chicks  

lay. Chicks feel the sting of meat stare.  
Bodies exposed before the vibes of mind had  
time to dance. Horny cat braver than the  
rest makes contact with one chick. He rubs  
his coarse suit against her bare arm while  

whispering gin tinged nothings in her ear.  

She repulses him with ice—MIND BEFORE  
FLESH  

PLEASE! The cat leaves dragging his limp  
tail

GoldFlower,3,3,AUGUST 1974,11,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No3_page011.txt,"In Part Three, Carlson discusses ways to  
achieve liberation, stressing that it re-  
quires both public and private assertiveness.  
She takes us through a quick re-examination  
of our lives, in search for an awareness of  
the sexist traps that keep us ""in our place.""  
She encourages women to come out of isola-  
tion from one another (sisterhood is power-  
ful!), giving resources for beginning rap  
groups, advice for fighting job discrimina-  
tion, and so on. Five ""sample"" marriages  
offer insights into varying degrees of sex-  
role indoctrination and their consequences.  
She puts responsibility for fulfillment  
where it belongs—with each woman, rather  
than through a male intermediary. An anno-  
tated bibliography of suggested readings  
reveals Carlson's sources, and they are ex-  
cellent. She is well read—lurking in the  
pages of her book are some of the finest  
feminists and a good deal of research.  

Carlson never tries to soften the truth of  
women's status. Without a trace of Polly-  
anna, she insists upon a re-evaluation of  
our self-worth and dares us to stand up and  
fight for our right to be full-fledged, in-  
dependent, complete human beings. Her anger  
and ours is channeled into positive attempts  
to take hold of our lives.  

"". . . what we are learning, all the gen-  
erations together, is that it is wonderful  
to be a woman, a strong, independent, able  
woman who is free to stretch and stretch and  
stretch until she can admire herself because  
of her own efforts rather than seek admira-  
tion in the eyes of a boy or a man.  

""Never mind the jeers of those who are  
quick to remind us of what we have not yet  
done. Who knows what women will accomplish  
when they have learned finally to be free?  
Who knows what the intelligence of women  
will contribute to the world now that the  
search of women has finally begun?""  

I think that Carlson's book is a basic  
primer for those new to the notion of  
women's liberation, and that, when finished  
with her book, her readers will hunger for  
those books and essays that treat each of  
her many topics in greater detail. (In  
reference to her remark about what women  
will accomplish—I strongly recommend The  
First Sex, by Elizabeth Gould Davis, which  
shows what women have already done. There  
has simply been a few thousand years' lapse  
since the time when men usurped power from  
the matriarchs and took credit for the great  
civilizations women had built! And ever  
since that time women's accomplishments have  
been hidden, ridiculed, or stopped in their  
tracks because of her entrapment into her  
limited sphere.)

WANTED:  
WOMEN ARTISTS  

Feminist Formations has added another ser-  
vice for women—a cooperative of women  
artists. They contacted a few of us, who  
contacted others, and slowly the coop  
started taking shape. But we need more  
people if it's going to work.  

We'd like you to join in expanding the co-  
op while it is still in its infancy. We  
think it would offer several advantages.  

We will share expenses of entrance fees in  
art fairs as well as a central location at  
which to display our work between shows and  
fairs. If several people share a booth the  
fee gets sliced several ways. And the  
booths cost less, too.  

We will share the work as well—making,  
setting up, and running the booths, taking  
turns so that no one will have to be there  
two or three full days and evenings at a  
stretch. Thus we save lots of energy.  
Another advantage is getting our work pub-  
licized, not easy when you work alone.  

But we need more artists! We need all  
kinds of art—pottery, painting, drawing,  
sculpture, jewelry, ceramics, macramé,  
weaving, crochet, and so on.  

FIRST ART FAIR—August 15-17.  

We already have an art fair lined up, the  
Southview Square Art Fair in West Saint  
Paul on August 15-17. If you're interested  
in showing your work with us, call Kathy  
Sarafolean at Feminist Formations (tel. no.  
721-5546).  

Since Feminist Formations is the center  
for the cooperative, and will therefore  
inherit a certain amount of mail handling,  
paperwork, phone calling, etc., in setting  
up art fairs, meetings, and so on, we feel  
that they should receive a percentage of  
profits. How much is a decision that the  
coop should make together.  

Those people who participate in the coming  
art fair, as well as those who call in to  

show an interest in the coop will be noti-  
fied of the next meeting date.

GoldFlower,3,3,AUGUST 1974,12,GoldFlower/GoldFlowerVol3No3_page012.txt,"Another Divine Comedy?

Recently, I spotted a lit-
tle gem on the newsstand.
This ""Mother of Pearl"" was
entitled HOW TO PICK UP
GIRLS. With curious fingers
I turned the pages of this
slim volume by Eric Weber.
What I read would put Plato
to shame. A deeper or more
insightful philosophy has not
been advocated in modern
times. I felt that I had
glimpsed a bit of the eternal
In reading this volume I
truly transcended myself.

My ""ethereal"" education
began with the first chapter.
It was in the first chapter
that I discovered the real
wisdom of Sage Weber's ""hum-
anistic"" philosophy. Accor-
ding to the ""intellectual""
Weber, ladies are just wait-
ing to be picked up and laid
down. That lovely lass at
the bus stop is not waiting

for a bus. She is waiting
for you, silly boy. Even if
you are ugly and have halito-
sis, she wants you. Her big,
soft boobs whisper little in-

vitations. Her high rise fan-

ny beckons. Her waiting for
the bus is all a sham. Women
have nothing important to do.
They are really waiting for
you.

On this principle alone,
dear Mr. Weber deserves a
Pulitzer Prize. However, his
""divine"" insight does not end
with this one abiding princi-
ple. He has other maggots of
wisdom. His insight at times
is almost overwhelming. He
truly shows to what extent a
human soul can soar.

His second ""divine"" prin-
ciple gives one pudding for
thought. Talk dirty to wom-
en, says the ""guiding light.""
The cruder your language the
more likely you are to score.

Tell the next little lady that
you meet that you like her
box. She might let you put
something in it. Tell anoth-
er babe that you like her
snow-capped mountains. Per-
haps, she'll let you do some
mountain climbing. Such in-
sightful advice for former
boy scouts! From Hades does
such wisdom come.

If you are starry-eyed by
such profound insight hold
on to your posterior. Mr.
Weber's next principle is
nothing less than earth shat-
tering. It would take an
Einstein to grasp its full
impact. We mortals can only
hope to get a tiny pin prick
of light. Surely, such gen-
ius is out of our reach!

The third principle takes
us to another dimension. The
sage tells his ""boys"" about
the “importance of being un-
earnest."" A little lie often
leads the lass to the lair.
Pretend you are interested in
more than her boobs. ""Girls
spend about twenty-three
hours a day primping,"" says
the astute author. So comp-
liment her efforts even if
it's bull. Yes, by all means
lie to her. She will not see
through the deception. Lad-
ies are myopia prone when it
comes to seeing through sham
and pretense. Even if they
can see through it women app-
reciate deception. Remember
old Eve telling Adam that the
apple was good for him?

Ah, so here we have the
""sacred"" principles laid
down in ""laymen's"" language.

Earnest Eric does not stop
here, however. He also tells
his disciples what to say.
The language that he advo-
cates is simple. After all,
the disciples are speaking to

simple creatures. Wise Weber
believes one to three word
phrases are the safest.

""Hi"" is the most appropri-
ate word. The broad will re-
spond with ""goodbye."" If she
does, you are one step closer
to beddy-bye. ""What's your
name?"" is a catchy phrase.
The chick might answer, “I'm
Gina Coreleone. My father
will make you an offer that
you can't refuse."" This is
an obvious come on. Boy, you
are almost there. ""You're a
Pisces, aren't you?"" is more
than clever. She could pos-
sibly answer, ""No, I'm a Com-
munist."" You are there!
Communist sounds like commune
and everybody knows what com-
munes are like. ""I love you""
is the greatest phrase of all.
The girl will answer, ""Doesn't
everybody?"" Now you
know that she has been around.
Perhaps she can teach you a
trick or two.

So woeful Weber is not
only equipped with wisdom,
but also with common sense.
He can tell kings of more
kingly values. He can tell
the peasant in the street
how to tell it like it isn't.
The man is a prophet. His
penetrating counsel stands
for all ages. He is the
""guiding light"" of the fu-
ture. It is important that
his work be preserved.

What is the best way to
handle this preservation?
First, drop it near a fire
hydrant where it may be per-
fumed by capricious canines.
Second, put it in the oven
so that it may be more than
""half baked."" Finally, ""lay""
it to rest under a sweet
smelling patch of cow dung.
Now this wondrous work is
preserved for all ""laymen"" to"

Flying exposes Kate Millett's weaknesses
and it also reveals her humanness, but
for me it also explains why she did become

so important to the movement. She is a
person with emotional, artistic, and politi-
cal courage, a woman with an almost mystical
ability to draw forth good from others.

Millett's book may be, as Fumio says
within it, ""romantic,"" it certainly is
overly long, but I encourage you to buy it
with a friend, read it and then talk about
it. The book is a wonderful sharing of a
woman's life and for us to extend that
sharing further is a way of fulfilling
Millett's ""mission"" as feminist and artist.

FEMINIST INSTITUTE
TO OPEN IN

A group of leading women
1975 writers, teachers and activists

has announced plans for a

feminist institute in Burlington,
Vermont. According to spokeswoman Joan Peters, the
institute, which will be named Sagaris after the double-
edged sword of the ancient Amazons, is meant to be
a feminist-humanist alternative to existing patriarchal
society schools of higher education. Dr. Peters said
that the institute would offer a greater degree of academ-
ic freedom than is found currently at colleges and univer-
sities offering women’s studies. “In many schools,” she
asserted, “women’s studies are controlled by men or
locked into a system that does not allow adequate free-
dom for maximum intellectual growth.” Courses at
the institute, which will begin with two five-week summer
sessions next year, will include political theory, women's
history, psychology, creative writing and journalism —
all taught from a feminist perspective. Tuition will be
arranged according to a sliding scale based on ability to
pay and will include child care.

AND THAT’S THE WAY

WOMAN’S TV IMAGE

The Sacramento Branch of

the American Association of
University Women recently
published a survey, ""The Im-
age of Women in Television.""

Results of the month-long study
of television news programs
and commercials show that
television news generally
projects two stereotyped im-
ages of women: helpless vic-
tims of kidnaps, rapes, mur-
ders and natural disasters...
or as opinionless, supportive
wives and mothers.

Other findings reveal:

Even more serious than
stereotyping is the virtual
omission of women from tele-
vision news. Out of 5,353
straight news stories moni-
tored on 221.5 hours of pro-
gramming, less than 10% (532)
were about women. Among
1,668 news features, only 273
dealt with women.

One monitor commented, ""Af-
ter watching television news
for awhile, you get the feel-
ing that women just don't ex-
ist.""

Television commercials
exhibit far more offensive
sexist bias than news
programs. With few excep-

tions, women were stereotyped

The survey involved 51 mon-

members, who were assigned
to every news program, every
day, on the three Sacramen-
to stations with network
affiliations.

At least one monitor was
at work by 5:55 a.m., watch-
ing Channel 13's ""Morning

assigned programs throughout
the day and evening, until
the night-owl watch on
11 p.m. and midnight news
summaries.

The monitors recorded their
findings on standardized
forms, using committee de-
fined criteria for what con-
stituted sexist bias. They
made notes on their conclu-
sions, filled out sheets for
every program monitored, and
then sent their results to
a committee which compiled
totals and wrote a final re-
port.

""We had three goals in mind,""

said Betty Wisham, chair-
woman for the AAUW media
study topic which guided the

""First, we wanted to make
our members more aware of
television's impact on the
image of women. Second, we
plan to present any findings
of bias to the local sta-
tions, their networks and to
the Federal Communications
Commission which licenses
