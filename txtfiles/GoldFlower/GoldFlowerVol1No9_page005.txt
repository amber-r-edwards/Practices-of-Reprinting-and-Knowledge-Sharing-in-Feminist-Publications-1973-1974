STALKING THE ' TERRA

the other morning I got up determined, med-
itated, smoked half a joint and did 20 sit-
ups. felt the same -- my revolutionary con-
sciousness hadn't risen a bit so I went out.
a friend, lately of Virginia said to me re-
cently that loving is the essence of life
and sometimes I wonder. I mean about our
capacity for loving and potential capacity
for hating or maybe it's the other way around
except hating takes about seventeen times as
much energy and you always have to remember
to be mad or hateful so that means it's not
really natural to our bodies but everything's
mixed up now anyway to the point where some
people even remember the times they were
happy and loving because they have found
themselves there so seldom. anyway, as much
as our culture has isolated us we're still
contagious like friendly and horrible vibes.
that's one thing that I learned from trans-
cendental meditation was that positive happy
vibes were catchy; and that a bus driver or
a waitress has really a lot of influence on
whole groups of people especially in rush
hours. hacking in Boston I was as dependent
on my passengers for the mood tone as they
were on me as fighting the traffic 9 hrs.
makes one a bit spacey and maybe I came on a
bit hard to some people but I got impatient
with their lack of response. women were the
most apprehensive towards conversation, some
of them even terrified; it's taking us so
long to be friends to one another in the
open I wonder if the revolution can wait
sometimes never mind loving one another,
but the stoned barriers are beginning to
crumble: the other day I saw 2 women on
Hennepin Avenue holding hands but somehow

anymore that doesn't seem so significant but
maybe it is for Mpls. for too long I've
been trying to find someone who could say
something relevant and not totally negative
about what to do about the men in lieu of

the rising tide of women's consciousness and
Pat C. said the other night that some of

them can be saved and I liked that. I was
having trouble with hating all men because
my Judeo-Christian conscience says that you
should love everybody even though they hate,
rape & murder you. I fail to see where wo-
men's love for men has helped men or women
all that much since recorded time began.

but people are screaming you can't go around
hating half of the population because they
were born male. although I don't understand
why you can't hate anything you want to as
well as love anything and besides hate comes
either before or after rejection which is
part of the necessary progression to reclaim-
ing one's own self-love. and C--- said

once that although she loved John she still
had to forgive him for his prick. the ulti-
mate in human relations is of course to be
able to forgive the one you're sleeping with
for nothing, esp. a prick. anyhow, it seems
that all along men have just wanted to hunt
and be wild and run around and kill things
and women have always tried to change that
and make them civilized & loving like women
which is not their nature. so of course they
hate our guts for not letting them be their
pugilistic selves. John Paul Getty ought to
build a mammoth terrarium in the Pacific and
all men could have free one way passage and
slaughter each other to their hearts' content
and leave us women to build our Amazon nation.

Myths About Sex
and Conception

-You can't get pregnant the
first time you have inter-
course.

False. Getting pregnant
doesn't require any practice!
The possibility of concep-
tion occurring depends upon
the timing of intercourse
with respect to ovulation
and is not related to the
amount of sexual experience.

‘You can't get pregnant if
you are a virgin (have not
experienced vaginal penetra-
tion).

False. Sperm are able to
swim past the hymen without
any penetration into the va-
gina by the penis. If sperm
are anywhere near the vagina,
pregnancy is possible.

*You can't get pregnant if

you are nursing an infant.
False. Ovulation can still

occur, and some form of con-

traception is necessary to

prevent conception.

*Look out for men who claim
to be sterile. This claim
may be false. In the first
place, even if the man be-
lieves it to be true or
knows that at one time it
was true, this condition va-
ries over time for many men,
except when the result of
surgery. Furthermore, some
men use this as an excuse to
avoid the bother of practic-
ing contraception. It’s awk-
ward to demand a laboratory
report; nonetheless, be cau-
tious about claims of steril-
ity.

*Women don't have as strong
a sexual drive as do men.
False. A woman is a sex-
ual being, and it is perfect-
ly natural for her to ex-
perience sexual desire ("get
horny") and to become sexual-
ly aroused as a result of
either mental or physical
stimulation. A woman's cap-
acity for sexual desire and
activity is as great as a
man's. In fact, because in-
tercourse is generally less

demanding for a woman, she
is capable of more sustained
sexual activity than is a
man. Becoming sexually a-
roused is largely a product
of letting herself receive
the sexual stimuli around
her. If women seem to exper-
ience less sexual drive than
men, it is often because

they are too concerned with
attracting sexual desire to
be able to respond adequate-
ly themselves.

-If a woman does not experi-
ence "vaginal orgasm," she
is “frigid."

False. The vagina is al-
most completely without
nerve endings, and orgasm is
not a product of vaginal
stimulation. The clitoris
is the physical organ respon-
sible for orgasm in the fe-
male. Orgasm can occur as
the result of direct manual
or oral stimulation or as
the result of the action of
the penis against the vulva
during intercourse. It is
the movement of the penis
against the entrance of the
vagina, not penetration into
the vagina, that causes fe-
male orgasm during inter-
course. Thus, those posi-
tions that provide the most
friction of the penis against
the vulva are most likely to
provide female orgasm. Mas-
ters and Johnson report that
the male-above-face-to-face
position is one of the poor-
est in this respect.
