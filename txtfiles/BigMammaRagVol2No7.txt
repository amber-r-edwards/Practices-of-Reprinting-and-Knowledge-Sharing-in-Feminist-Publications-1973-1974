A Woman's Place:

Creating the Universe

Janet Sergi

How do we get away from Amerika 1974 and to a Woman's place, date unknown?

Looking at history and trying to be aware of all that is happening right now gives both a dismal and hopeful view.

In the late nineteenth century, men discovered their patriarchal God was too strict. These white men knew that this God was not conceived in their most complementary image, so they decided “God is Dead.” A new god was needed. They were it. Thus new possibilities opened up. Since there were no absolute laws to follow, everything was possible—as long as it was in the interest of white men.

What followed was the industrial revolution, leaps in man-made technology, the rape of the Earth, wars, revolutions, the new religions (Dread, Anxiety, and Despair). The white man’s soul was projected as the new God. It contained nothing. White man had reached his final peak—Absurdity.

Man is Dead

Today the White Man is dead. It is up to Woman to create the universe. She must create the values and lifestyles in keeping with her Woman soul. This soul has been forgotten by both the patriarchal God and by the male concept of Absurdity. But She lives! Man is Dead. Absurdity is Dead. Now everything is possible.

White man is nothing but the reflection of his own lack of grounding in the life processes. His energies are borrowed from his mother, the poor and the Third World communities. Man is Nothing. Man is dead. Enough of beating a dead horse. Woman must get on with their real business, that of Creation.

The energies and oneness with the natural order of things, that used to be part of childbearing, are now freed to create a fit world. A world fit for the child in all of us. A world where wonder and awareness are the prime qualities that are given social approval. A community where aggressiveness in the pursuit of beauty and love, not in competitiveness and destruction, is the mark of distinction.

Man is Dead. Women are giving birth to themselves. A Woman's place is that place within ourselves that the hopelessness and self-hate of white men could not reach. Woman’s self-hate and anxiety come from accepting the Male Culture’s definitions of her either as an ever-nurturing mother or as an incomplete existential creature with no future.

The Male Culture is Dead. The male wasteland is nowhere land. A Woman's place is the only somewhere there is. A vision of womanhood that transforms all ways of being and seeing life is what Radical Feminism is all about. All our political actions must prepare the way for externalizing our woman's soul onto the outside world.

Woman’s Revolution

We need good paying jobs to survive while we are making a woman’s revolution. But to make entry into the male capitalist economy our top political priority would be a deadly mistake.

Equal pay for equal work, like the vote, is a piece of the Amerikan pie that is basically inedible. There is no equality in a death culture. The Capitalist system is founded on the free labor of women in the household and cheap labor in the economy. To pay women for their real services is impossible in a profit motivated society.

Energies Diverted

Better jobs for women are possible only for a select few. The token woman is used by the male capitalist order to divert energies of the most aggressive woman away from making a truly humanized society. We need the best jobs and the most skills we can obtain, but our real task is making a woman’s culture that frees all members of it—not just a few.

There is no equality in a death culture; for woman to ask parity with man is to ask to be nothing, to be dead.

As my old friend used to say, “No slogans can convey my hopes, but we cannot be co-opted because we want everything.”

By Lake Circumspect

We talk about white weight, white walls, and white whales, but I still think seasonal images are only as fitting as the calendar. Otherwise, after Winter we would fade away like white light encompassing all the spectrum colors, the step beyond that and naturally we will not. Because spring is green of course anybody knows that.

By Lake Circumspect

The seedling of this whole is that the growth of these human plantlings is limited only by one’s own estimation of the circular pot at one’s feet. Beyond that, anything is possible.

Sex Preference Vote Slated

The controversial amendment to the City of Boulder’s human rights ordinance, which would prohibit job discrimination because of “sexual preference,” has been set for a referendum vote on May 7.

The amendment, which originally included a ban on discrimination on the basis of marital status and age, has been divided up by the City Council after groups opposing the “sexual preference” part of the measure began their campaign to defeat the amendment. The sections banning discrimination on the basis of age and marital status have won the approval of the City Council, but the section dealing with the civil rights of gay people will be put to a referendum vote.

Speaking at the Denver chapter of NOW’s panel on Lesbianism on March 25, Georgia Borgen of Boulder Gay Liberation stated that most recently those opposing the referendum have taken two new approaches to defeat the measure.

They are attempting a recall of those male City Council members who supported the amendment (the female City Council members who supported the amendment have been serving in their positions for less than six months, so they are ineligible for such a recall). The opponents are attempting to have the referendum postponed to a later date—possibly during the summer months when those members of the university would not be present. Ms. Borgen also noted that the gay community, while having a basis of strong support from many community groups, is at a disadvantage because the Boulder Daily Camera has refused to print the advertisements that Gay Liberation has prepared for them.

The amendment to the city’s human rights ordinance would protect the employment rights of those with “an inclination or preference for or an orientation towards intimate sexual relations with a member of one’s own sex or with members of both sexes.” Several U.S. cities have such ordinances, but Boulder would be the first in Colorado.

NOW Features Lesbianism Panel

Approximately 250 people attended the March 25 meeting of the Denver Chapter of NOW (National Organization of Women) which featured a panel discussion on “Lesbianism and Lesbian Lifestyles.”

Prior to the panel discussion, a member of the Boulder group Concerned Citizens for Civil Rights spoke on the current situation of the homosexual rights bill now pending in that city. With a recall election of the mayor and city council scheduled for May 7, the Boulder daily press has placed a “blackout” on all advertising from those who support the bill. The citizens group there welcomes all support, particularly financial.

The panel opened with a statement from each of the three members concerning her own thoughts and feelings about Lesbianism as both a political position and a sexual preference. While the link between Lesbianism and Feminism was mentioned, it was never fully discussed by any of the panel members, who occasionally drifted into apologetic tones throughout the evening.

During the question and answer session which followed, a group of “Separatist Dykes” took the floor to protest discrimination against them from the Women’s Movement and NOW. They noted that NOW had not invited any separatists to participate in the panel. A reflection, they felt, of both classism and intellectualism within the Women’s Movement and NOW. Following about fifteen minutes of sparring, the discussion moved on and closed shortly afterward.

A task force has recently been formed within NOW to focus on legislation which will help to remove legal barriers surrounding the Lesbian.

Co-op Replaces Extended Family

Harriet Hunter Ford

In these days of ever increasing  
inflation, there never seems to  
be enough money to go around.  
Not too long ago, most of us  
were part of an extended family.  
We had people to help look after  
the children, to share things  
with, and to talk with. All of  
these things were exchanged  
with one another. As people  
have become more mobile,  
many of us are many miles  
away from ‘family’. About  
two years ago, my neighbor and  
friend, Virginia Lehman, told  
me she had an alternative to the  
extended family. She suggested  
that we form a “co-op” in which  
we could exchange babysitting  
and other jobs we wanted done  
or wanted to do. At first, I was  
very apprehensive. I thought we  
should do things for each other  
“just to be nice”. Virginia  
pointed out to me that that was  
a very fine but unrealistic  
attitude because it is just too  
easy for one person to take  
advantage of the other if some  
kind of record isn’t kept. After  
much discussion, our co-op was  
launched. We decided that we  
would translate our “charges”  
for services or jobs into co-op  
credits. We place a co-op credit  
value on each service desired or  
offered. This is loosely based on  
what would be paid on the open  
market. One exception to this is  
babysitting. We charge one  
co-op credit per hour per child.  
A co-op credit is worth 60 cents.  
We feel that child care is  
extremely important and is too

often taken for granted. The  
children receive more than mere  
custodial care when they are  
with members of the co-op. The  
values we placed on services are  
used only as a guideline and the  
people involved are free to  
negotiate at any time. We  
exchange many services other  
than babysitting. Among them  
are: transportation,  
housecleaning, ironing,  
secretarial services, pre-school,  
food, clothes, acrobatic lessons,  
etc. The co-op now has twelve  
members which is the maximum  
number we have set for  
membership. When we first got  
started, our husbands by and  
large thought we were slightly  
unbalanced, to say the least.  
When they heard us say things  
like “I’ll give you this ham bone  
with lots of ham on it for two  
co-op credits”, there were  
certain that the diagnosis was  
accurate. Now, however, we find  
that their tune is changing. Our  
husbands are beginning to catch  
the disease. A few months ago,  
my husband became our twelfth  
member. He's a family  
practitioner and exchanges his  

Gay Coalition Needs Help

The Denver Gay Coalition at  
1450 Pennsylvania St. has  
formed a committee to draft a  
broad anti-discrimination bill to  
be presented to the Colorado  
State Legislature during its next  
session. The bill would ban  
discrimination on the basis of  
sexual preference, marital status  
and age in the areas of job  
discrimination, housing, state  
certification, admission  
programs to educational  
institutions, child custody, and  
prisoner rights.

Any interested persons who  
would like to work on this  
committee, please contact Marge

“Women in the People’s  
Republic of China have achieved  
social, economic, and political  
equality with men," said Ms.  
Susan Klonsky, who recently  
headed the American Women’s  
Friendship Delegation to that  
country.

At a free public meeting on  
March 14, at the University of  
Colorado (Denver Center) Ms.  
Klonsky presented  
approximately 100 slides  
concerning the changes which  
have taken place for Chinese  

women since the socialist  
revolution in 1949.  
Just one generation ago  

women there were practically  
slaves in their families, had no  
legal rights, were sold into  
prostitution, and had their feet  
bound not for beautification, but  
to keep them from running  
away from their masters.

The purpose of Ms. Klonsky’s  
delegation, which consisted of  
about 14 women ranging in  
political persuasions from the  
National Organization of  
Women to the October League,  
was to “investigate changes in  
the lives of people—especially  
women—since the socialist  
revolution.”

Hold Leading Positions

“Women in China,” stated Ms.  
Klonsky, “have progressed from  
having practically no power  
whatever to holding leading  
positions in government,  
industry, education, and cultural  

institutions.”  
Chinese women are not only  

employed in almost every  
conceivable job position  
(doctors, welders, farmers,  

industrial mechanics, etc.), they  
also have control along with  
male workers to organize and  
oversee their jobs. One factory  
employing mostly women even  
shut down production for a year  
while the women there designed  
a way to protect themselves  
from lung (a disease  
common to U.S. mill workers).

“Institutions in China today,”  
explained Ms. Klonsky, “are  
geared to serve the people rather  
than to make profits.”  
(Complete health coverage, for  

example, may be purchased for  

as little as a dollar a year.)

Today there are only about  
four kinds of jobs which Chinese  
women are not permitted to do  
and these include coal mining,  
operating heavy equipment, and  
being exposed to temperature  
extremes. “The reason for these  
restrictions,” explained Ms.  
Klonsky, “is that there is a great  
emphasis on family life and it is  
feared that such jobs might  
possibly damage women’s  
reproductive organs.”  
Not Pressured To Marry  
The pressure to marry, however,  
has been taken off Chinese  
women today by making full  
employment available. Abortion  
is free on demand and child care  
centers are provided all over the  

country. Divorce is also free and  
there is no alimony to pay, but  
couples wishing to end their  
marriage usually go before a  
kind of criticism committee first  
(composed of townspeople) to  
help decide if the marriage can  
be saved.  
Women Martyrs  

Women in China are not only  
actively engaged in running the  
country today, they also played  
a large part in overthrowing the  
old system which enslaved them.  
They fought alone and with men  
in the Red Army and there are  
many pictures on display in  

Conference Held  

consenting adults for inter-  
course to occur.

The conference was split  
into four groups in the after-  
noon: counselling, health  
care, education, and legisla-  
tion.

The education group dis-  
cussed a mass media cam-  
paign to begin around April  
19. People from Denver Un-  
iversity will be making  
posters, pamphlets and other  
materials will be printed.  
There will be a speakers  
bureau set up in which  
research will be done, a  
slide-show will be made and  
people will learn to speak in  
front of a group.

The persons in health  
care agreed to develop an ad-  
vocacy program whereby a  
woman could be “on call” —  
when a woman is raped, the  
woman on call will go to the  
hospital to give emotional  
support to the victim.

Use Sexuality  

In the legislative group,  
the top priority was changing  
the prior chastity rule. At pre-  
sent, the victim's past sexual  
experiences can be used  
against her in an open court;  
whereas, the activities of the  
accused cannot be  
presented.

In the counselling area,  

the group decided to es-  
tablish a crisis center to coor-  
dinate health care services  
including counselling, court  
procedures and police. Also  
to keep the woman informed  
of her case.

The conference is only  
the beginning. The coalition  
has hopes of sponsoring  
more of these in different  
parts of the city as part of the  
educational area. All of this,  
of course, is going to take  
knowledge, concern and a lot  
of hard work, especially on  
the part of women.

Anyone interested in  
working with the Coalition or  
in more information, please  
call Dr. Katherine Saltzman  
or Julie Stark at 321-8192.  
Also, if you have been raped  
and would like to talk to  
someone call 321-8191  
(between the hours of 9 a.m.  
and 9 p.m.).

Editor's comment: In addi-  
tion to the measures taken  
concerning rape discussed  
by this conference, we think  
just as much emphasis  
should be placed on  
establishing and en-  
couraging self-defense  
courses for women. An  
ounce of real prevention...

China honoring women martyrs.  
Today there is much emphasis  
on equal physical training for  
both girls and boys and both  
women and men receive training  
in the People’s Militia.

Added Ms. Klonsky, “the U.S.  
military maintains 14,000  
women to repair its uniforms,  
but in China the men must do  
this task themselves."

Lesbians in China  
After the slide presentation  
Ms. Klonsky answered questions  
from the audience concerning  
her talk. One woman asked  
about the condition of lesbians  

STEREOTYPES  

in China. Ms. Klonsky explained  
that although lesbians were not  
persecuted outright or sent to  
institutions to become  
heterosexually-oriented, their  
sexual preference was looked  
upon as a “political deviation  
because of the emphasis on  
family structures.”

A man expressed his opinion  
that “there shouldn't be any  
question of male chauvinism in  
China because women had  
always been taught to respect  
and obey the men.”

To this utter tripe Ms.  
Klonsky said, “Well, I can think  
of about 400 million Chinese  
women who would very much  
disagree with you!”

Stereotyping Conf.  
Big Disappointment  

Randi Lornelli  

One of the problems of  
any mass movement are the  
inevitable differences in  
stages of consciousness.  
While some women are well  
along the way of developing  
totally new lifestyles, others  
are just beginning to wonder  
if maybe hubby shouldn't  
pick up his own clothes in-  
stead of leaving them where  
they fell.

Unfortunately, the Con-  
ference on Stereotyping in  
Education, held at Colorado  
Women’s College on March  
1, seemed to be aimed at  

those people who are getting  
the first faint glimmers that,  
(sexual, ethnic, religious)  
stereotyping does exist.  
Perhaps they found the con-  
ference enlightening but  
anyone who already had  
some awareness was bound  
to be bored. Who really needs  
to be told that girls are taught  
to please men rather than  
themselves?

The conference ran into  
problems from the begin-  
ning. Pre-registered par-  
ticipants had to wait as long  
as forty-five minutes to pick

Utopia in China?

So let's forget about the Women’s Movement here and
move to China. Women there, it is claimed, have achieved
social, political, and economic equality along with the men and
can supposedly even grow up to take a place on the Central
Committee someday.

While we do not intend to minimize the tremendous
strides that have been made in the interests of Chinese people
today, we would seriously question the premise that the sexes
are now really “equal” there. Certainly the Chinese govern-
ment has giant-stepped the U.S. in its efforts to combat sexism

and racism and to build a decent place to live and work for all
the people, but to assume that women have achieved the ul-
timate in what women can achieve would be a drastic mistake.

Underlying Levels

Despite the visible gains for Chinese women today, no-
thing is ever mentioned about how or if the underlying levels of
male oppression are ever dealt with or even, in fact, con-
sidered. It is these underlying levels which perpetuate a male
state where male culture and male absurdity still abound — the
kind of state that still forces women to have to ask for so-called
“equality.”

Said Ms. Klonsky in her talk Thursday night (see article,
page 3) “Go out and do it. Prove you can do it. Women have
gained respect by doing it in China.” Gained whose respect?
Proved what to whom? Why men of course. And there we are —
back at getting male approval for our existence again. And real-
ly, what is so revolutionary about that?

Granted, Chinese women are taking an active part in many
facets of the country’s operation, but “taking part” is only that.
When it comes right down to it Chinese men are still occupying
the real positions of power in China and are still making the
decisions about women’s destiny there — women occupy only
about 12% of government positions. (We'd be interested in see-

ing just how long women’s equality would last if they demand-
ed an equal share in running the government from the top
echelons.)

Who else but males would decide that women can’t be
employed in certain positions because it would “damage their
reproductive organs”? (a doubtful as well as blatantly sexist
conclusion anyway). What of the woman who doesn’t want to
have children or the Chinese lesbian, or the woman who just
might want to do one of those jobs?

Political Deviation?

Who else but men would say that homosexuality is really a
“political deviation” (just a more sophisticated way of saying
sick) not understanding that “homosexuality is a category of
behavior possible only in a sexist society characterized by rigid
sex roles and dominated by male supremacy”? (Woman Iden-
tified Woman). In spite of all Ms. Klonsky’s attempts to explain
away gay suppression in China by talking about how important
the nuclear family structure is there, the fact remains that

where gay people do not have real expression, the country is
still a sexist one underneath all its pretty layers of
achievements.
Yes women have come far in the People's Republic of China
but they also still have a long way to go.

Dear Editors:

(Re: Experience with
Separatist Dykes at March 25
NOW Meeting.)

The things I went to the
mountains to do, I’ve done.
Now I want to be with other
feminists and Lesbians, so
I've been spending a lot of
time in Denver lately.

As I listened to the state-
ments of the separatists
Monday night, I began to
wonder if I was exchanging a
positive energy environment
for a negative one. Although
I thought many of the points

I am a woman who identifies
herself as a Lesbian. For the
past year and a half I have
been living in the mountains
in semi-seclusion,
sometimes not seeing people
for days at a time and work-
ing on my own head. A lot of

Letter Continued

made by the separatists were
valid, I could not ignore the
negativism, the hatred, the
double-think and the double-
talk.

As I listened to the rap
about clothes and hair —
appearance in general — I
felt they weren't interested in
my development as an in-
dividual, my identity, or my
self-expression but only in
my indoctrination. I have long
hair and I don't feel that it’s a
cop-out; I’m not hiding my
Lesbianism from anyone. In
one way it makes things
more difficult because I have
to tell people I'm a dyke —
they can’t assume it from my
appearance. And I do tell
them — personal confronta-
tion — I prefer that to the lack
of personal contact. In one
sense cutting your hair short
is copping to the man, who
has defined woman’s
appearance. Short hair is not
traditionally feminine, and
that’s why it can be used by
Lesbians as a political state-
ment. Personally, I don’t give
a damn what anyone looks
like. I wear my hair long
because I like it and because
it happens naturally when I
leave it alone. And that kind
of thinking seems to me to be
a lot closer to freedom than
simply instating a new
stereotype is.

And work? The state-
ment was made that “we
don't work with men and we
don't work with women who
work with men” along with
statements about being the
only women where they
work. What? They don't work
with men and they are the only
women in the shops. Is there
a third sex I don't know
about? And aren’t these
Lesbians putting profits in
the pockets of the man? Now
just where are they really at?

The separatists also
spoke of classism within the
movement and about how
this divides women. I think
that’s true. But I also feel that
antagonism and hatred are

Hot Times at NOW Meeting

“THE BAD FAIRIES WHO CAME TO THE CHRISTENING
UNINVITED”

Time: Early evening, March 25th. Setting: A very polite meeting of the
National Organization for Women. Subject: Lesbianism. Par-
ticipants: Three nice Lesbians on a panel, five bad fairies, and a room
full of bewildered observers. Purpose: “To educate the public” (??!).

Panel Dialogue: We are Lesbians. We are doing our own thing. We
are living authentically. We think Lesbianism is an important issue
because NOW just formed a task force on it. We have come to
educate... 1.) I belong to the Gay Coalition and I believe in human
rights for everyone, regardless... 2.) I am a member of the Lesbian
Resource Center in Boulder and I believe I'm a Lesbian.... 3.) I am really
Cinderella... (Question: Will the real Lesbian please stand up?)

Bad Fairies: We are five women in Denver who call ourselves
Separatist Dykes. We don’t work with men and we don’t work with
women who work with men and we don’t work with anybody but
ourselves. (Question: We don’t fuck and we don’t screw and we don't
go with the girls who do?) We hate all of you straight chickies who
have long hair and wear earrings and fuck us dykes over by existing.
We get shit every day because we're dykes who are proud and strong
(not because we're loud and obnoxious) and who aren’t afraid to say
we're better than everybody else (and say it and say it and say it ad
nauseam). We never smile. We know Karate.

Audience Response: And what are you five a coalition of? ... belch...
Gee, isn't it swell that we girls can all get together like this and have
controversy in this nifty organization? ... What do you Lesbians do in
the daytime anyway? ... I'm not telling you to shut up ... shut up...
Could you tell me where the Ladies' room is please? ... Get them out of
here ... But what can we do to help you? ... Women must stop fighting
each other! Join NOW! (applause) ... Hey, I really came here to raise
money ... Pass the hat around. Throw in a dime for the dykes.

Interpretation: All kidding around aside, we realize that not everyone
has exactly the same views about Lesbianism, the political importance
of Lesbianism, or even the understanding that Lesbianism is vitally
connected with feminism. A group of women known as the
Radicalesbians wrote a statement in 1970 called Woman-identified
Woman which has been one of the most important articles ever
written on these relationships. Since they said it better than we can,
we'd like to reprint some excerpts from this statement here:

A Lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explo-
sion. .

Those of us who work that (coming to understand what this sexist
society has done to her and why it is functional and necessary for it to
do so) through find ourselves on the other side of a tortuous journey
through a night that may have been decades long. The inner peace,
the real love of self and of all women, is something to be shared with
all women — because we are all women... .

It should first be understood that Lesbianism, like male homosexuality,
is a category of behavior possible only in a sexist society
characterized by rigid sex roles and dominated by male supremacy.
In a society in which men do not oppress women, and sexual expres-
sion is allowed to follow feelings, the categories of homosexuality
and heterosexuality would disappear.
But Lesbianism is also different from male homosexuality, and serves
a different function in the society. “Dyke” is a different kind of put-

Big Mama Rag Born Out
of Frustration, Success

Elissa Meyer

Big Mama Rag was born out
the need for expression,
women’s expression. She began
as an idea conceived at a
women’s festival in Denver and
was published for the first time
nine months later, in October of
1972.

The women who worked on
the paper and grew with Big
Mama have learned the depth of
meaning involved in expression
and communication. The paper
has become much more to some
of us than a form of mass media.
We have learned to share the
frustrations and successes of
creation, to start with nothing
and replace the emptiness with a
reality.

In the beginning the
excitement of actually seeing
those finished and folded pieces
of newsprint, the paper that told
our stories and reflected our
emotions, was sufficient to

enhance the dedication of our .

group. Most of us had full-time
jobs in institutions or with
children, We met and worked on
the paper in the evenings and on
weekends, and although we
encountered many difficulties in
trying to create a newspaper
given our time limitations, we
managed to publish pretty
consistently every two months
for over a year.

Recent Grant

Being proud and encouraged
by our accomplishment, we
pursued alternative modes for
continuing and supporting the
publication of Big Mama. In
January of 1974 the Aton
foundation granted us a small
sum of money to back the paper
for six months. This money
provides for one full time salary
of $350 per month, which we
now split three ways among the
co-editors, and for office
expenses and some promotional
money.

Recieving this grant really
marks a transitional period for
Big Mama Rag. She has evolved
from a feeling to a full-fledged
periodical. And now the women
who make up the staff are
tackling the task of making Big
Mama a sucessful business. Not
in the sense of making a profit,
but we do want the paper to
become a_ self-supporting

venture.

A great part of reaching this
goal depends on how much the
women’s community of Denver
shares our enthusiasm for this
means of expression and
relationship with each other.
The paper’s longevity depends
largely on continued financial
and volunteer support, in the
form of subscriptions,
contributions and work. ~

We have continually kept ears,
eyes and hearts open for ways to
raise the necessary money. We're
looking forward to having a

May 11, and we would ask any
woman who would like to
exhibit arts and crafts and share
the proceeds with us to call
Becky at 623-3423 and join us.
We also welcome any other
fund-raising suggestions as well
as the energy to carry them
through.

Thanks for Existing

As the paper has developed
throughout the last two years,
the lives of those of us on the
staff have changed, matured and
mingled with each others’. And

‘when we stress the continuation

of Big Mama we emphasize this
process. Each time we receive a
letter that says, ‘““Thank you for

existing. | live in Aurora (or
Lakewood, or Golden, or
Kansas), and when | see Big

Mama Rag | realize that
Feminism is active and growing
and even reaching out here. | am
delighted and encouraged.”

Every time BMA elicits that
kind of response, the staff's
sense of responsibility deepens.
We grow in our commitment to
one another and to the larger
women’s movement. The
recognition that women need to
relate, to express, to exchange
our stories and experiences has
added significance to Big Mama
as a paper and to our lives as her
creators.

Because of this commitment,
the paper’s reputation is growing
nationally. Presently, Big Mama
Rag is ranked among the most
successful women’s papers in the
country, along with Ajin’t / a
Woman, Off Our Backs,
Women’s Press (to name some).
We are grateful to our readership
and to the many women who,
have helped with the papers’
production.

With this same kind of
support, we will stay around and
will continue to touch the
spaces where women = are
growing stronger, where we are
beginning to realize our
potential as individuals, where
women are emerging in affection
and unity as Feminists. Because
wherever this is happening our
potential for social change is
limitless.

Working Girl Mystique

Lynda Hartman

Have you ever heard of the
“working boy mystique’? Well,
neither have |. In the business
world, there is a very definite
“working girl mystique” where
women are treated as girls.

The mystique can be
recognized by several
characteristics. Men in offices

are always looking for “‘girls’’
who will nurture them. It is not
uncommon to be asked where
supplies are; get me a pencil!
“I'm helpless,” they say, ‘serve
me.”

Many men are also always
fookingfor ‘‘girl’s” asses to pinch
or trying to look at their legs

and breasts. The shortest
dresses, lowest cut tops (of
course not too low) are

excellent forms of dress. The
men sometimes start competing
amongst each other for the
cutest “‘girl.”” To call a female a
woman often brings sexuality
into full force. Men do
not/cannot want to face up to
the fact that the women in the
office have their own sexual
feelings, which go beyond being
treated as “‘girls.””

| have had sexual feelings
towards the people | see eight
hours a day. The difference for
me is that | do not feel a need to
compete with the other women
for the men. | do not need to
say how | have brushed* up
against a man’s penis or looked
at another woman’s breasts. |
have had fantasies ‘about some
of the men in my office, but |
see them as only fantasies and
nothing more. | can enjoy
flirting with these men when
both of us knows all along that
we are just playing a game, and
we have no further intentions. |
can also appreciate compliments
on my appearance when it is

done as an appreciation of my
sexuality, and not as a pretty
‘girl’ fulfilling someone
else’s needs,

Often the mystique role also
comes out when one sees
women carrying coffee to their
male workers. How often do you
see a man carrying two cups of
coffee? ‘’Girls’’ carry coffee as
part of their job. They are
considered indispensible, It is
easy to find another coffee
carrier! Also of course the
female does all the kitchen work
at home, so she can do it in the
office. Many women today are
calling kitchen work a job that
should be shared by everyone
who eats.

It seems to me that if office
people of both sexes cannot even
share very simple tasks, that we
have a long way to go before
people will be on a more equal

basis in offices. All office
workers are basically
interdependent upon one

another. The tasks of all cannot
be done without the other
people in the office. We are all
people who have to work to
survive. Unfortunately, until
women are treated as women,
equality will not be seen in the
business world.

The “girl mystique’ in the
office must be changed.
Nurturing, sex objects, poor
pay, lack of privacy and
respectability of work all lead to
the “girl mystique.” Let's not
forget or let people put us in
another place; we're women!

Work Not Important?

The “girl mystique’ comes
into play in terms of physical
set-up of office space. Women
are not given offices, they don’t

892-1172

need privacy. ‘’Girl’s” work is
not considered important
enough for them to have the
respect of their own office. | am
now sitting in an area that was a
secretary area in the entrance
way to several offices. | am
asked questions about the
whereabouts of the men in the
area even though they are in
different departments and |
rarely work with them.

Salaries are another ‘‘girl
mystique”. “Girls’’ do not need
to earn much money. They may
be supporting children and are
sole heads of a household, but

they’re “girls.” Also the single
woman feels the salary
discrimination. The trend in

business seems to be that single
women do not need to earn
money! For more on women
and job positions see BMR (No.
6 April, 1974).

The “girl mystique” includes
the fact that “girls” cannot
make decisions on their own,
They present the problems,
bring up the solutions, and the
male bosses make the decisions.
This of course frees the “’girls”
from having the responsibility of
making a wrong (bad) decision!
Heaven forbid! Of course it also
frees them from making a right
decision. Part of the mystique is
saying that ‘girls’ cannot make
decisions, so why worry their
little heads!

Personal defense classes are
being held every Thursday night
at 7:30 p.m. downstairs in the
Unitarian Church at 14th and
Lafayette. Classes will continue
through June. The instructors
both hold high degrees in
Taekwon-Do but will teach a
variety of martial arts with
emphasis on personal defense.
They teach other self-defense
classes in Denver. There will be a
minimal but not mandatory fee
for the purchase of mats and
pine boards. The boards will be
used at a party at the end of the
course. All people welcome. The
exercise that the class stresses
really gets or keeps the body in
shape in addition to increasing
physical self-confidence.



Big Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 7

Brass Plum: Birth, Life of a Co-op

Carol Lease

wondered  
what happened to all the energy  
that dissatisfaction generated in  
the early seventies when the  
rhetoric was fading and people  
were “getting into themselves”?

Have you ever

Did anger creating its own  
frustration seek comfort in  
drugs whose banal highs eventually  
descended to religious ex-  
perience?

Many people recognized  
opportunity in the marketing  
potential of the dissatisfaction  
of “young” consumers, rounded  
up capital and invested in  
counter-culture profits. Some  
people wanted an alternative  
structure to live and work in  
that would not alienate their  
convictions from their necessity  
to survive in a city. And a few of  
these people looked around  
until they saw a store on 17th  
Street across from a small island  
park for rent and took their  
energy and made a co-operative  
for artists and craftspeople to  
make and display and sell their  
work.

The Brass Plum opened in  
December of 1970 when about  
thirty people decided that they  
wanted to work and sell their art  
and crafts through a co-opera-  
tive business structure. Annie  
Wood, an original member of  
the co-op, recalls, “a lot of  
different people were into social  
change at that time... high  
school kids from some kind of  
street academy helped build in  
the store, their teacher really  
liked the idea of a co-op and let  
them stay in the store instead of  
a classroom.

Co-op Did Well

“We opened before Christmas  
and did really well. There were  
workshops taught by co-op  
craftspeople in the part of the  
store that is now the Denver  
Free University’s coffeehouse.  
Then came the after Christmas  
sales slump and some people left  
when their work didn’t sell.

Meanwhile we learned that too  

many open doors and too many  
people wandering in and out led  
to thievery which, along with  
our lack of business experience,  
put us into debt. Our organiza-  
tion was too loose.

The Brass Plum then began to  
change from a counter-culture  
fling to a stable co-operative  
venture. Members learned that  
there is seldom instant return on  
their work, that being in a co-op  
means accepting responsibility  
not only for yourself but for the  
entire structure also through  
cooperation with each other.  
“The co-op lets each of us forget  
100% of the hassles of owning a  
store individually because we're  
all in this together and we  
support each other,” according  
to Annie.

Having the opportunity  
to meet people who buy your work  
is another advantage of the  
co-op. The artist doesn’t have to  
deal with high consignment  
rip-offs that push up prices and  
discourage sales. In a co-  
operative business the money  
exchanged for work is much  
closer to the true value of that  
work than in a profit-seeking  
business due to the absence of  
the middleperson and their in-  
come.

Co-ops Respected

People respect co-ops. A man  
stole a candle from the Brass  
Plum but brought it back with a  
quarter and an apology when he  
found out that he had ripped off  
a co-operative business.

The expenses of the co-op  
such as rent and utilities are paid  
by monthly dues and new  
membership fees. If any money  
is left over it is used for  

advertising, something that  
Bette Warren, a dressmaker in  
the Brass Plum Co-op, thinks is  
sorely needed. “No one knows  
we're here. In the past we  
haven’t done as much adver-  
tising as we would have liked to.  
We hope that the Street Fair this  
spring when the Folklore Center  
moves up to 17th and Park,  
right across from our store, will  
help us become more visible to  
the community.”

The co-op holds bi-monthly  
meetings at which business deci-  
sions are discussed and decided  
through consensus or vote.  
Every three months a new  
chairperson of meetings, secre-  
tary, treasurer, custodian, and  
advertiser are chosen. This way  
each member experiences every  
aspect of the co-operative busi-  
ness structure. Nobody wants to  
be the leader and nobody can  
become a controller. There is no  
need for a boss because cooper-  
ation tends to level the heights  
that people tend to rely on for  
survival.

Members help each other out,  
according to Jim Bednar a  
potter from Castle Clay Co-op.  
“When I started to sell things I  
wasn't very confident. People at  
the shop were friendly and  
encouraging and now I make a  
significant part of my income  
through my craft.”

Open for Change

Even though the co-op is  
always open for changes and  
suggestions, it has basic written  
rules that are adhered to because  
it's “too messy without rules,”  
insists Annie. Being the store-  
keeper twice monthly is such a  
rule. Working two days a month  
in the shop is not as inflexible as  
it may seem. Members can work  
half days and Saturdays if they  
have other jobs and can even  
make arrangements with friends  
to work in the store for them.  
Co-op members can trade off  
days for long periods of time so  
that a member can go on long  
trips. Deals can be made as long  
as the work rule is obeyed.

As for the future Annie says  
that the co-op “takes it as it  
comes. The reason we’re here is  
that this is the logical way to go  
about doing something you  
want to do while being in an  
atmosphere with other crafts-  
people and artists.”

There is no distinction within  
the co-op between the ten women  
members and the three men  
members. Collective action  

keeps the store going, not sexist  

stereotyping.

When asked if she experi-  
enced problems at the Brass  
Plum because of her sex, Annie  
replies, “In the co-op, no. In  
life, yes.”

Different Position

The position of a woman in  
any profit-motivated business is  
radically different from her  
position in a co-operative busi-  
ness. In the former she must  

have credentials—material and  
emotional, social and psycho-  
logical—that are indispensable  
parts of getting a job. Her life  
becomes fragmented and is split  
into the behavioral expectations  
of the boss and the customer  
and the secretary and the  
accountant. Individuality is ana-  
thema in this type of economic  
structure. Going home from  
work temporarily dulls the alien-  
ation but only change creates  
permanent relief that especially  
affects a woman who is in the  
double locked jail of capitalist  
sexism.

In the latter each member has  
specific responsibilities in the  
co-operative store. Duties are  
cycled so that the absence of  
any co-op member cannot  
inhibit the operation of the  
entire co-op. The possible lack  
of experience that a woman (or  
anyone) may bring to the co-op  
is unimportant. Everyone learns  
and changes and hopefully  
grows thus creating growth in  
the structure and function of  
the co-operative. A woman who  
works in a co-op isn’t seen as  
being any different from any  
other woman because she isn’t  
any different.

Theory Shattered

She shatters the “unique-  
woman-pulls-herself-out-of-  

the-baby-bottle-ghetto-theory,”  
which, like its racist counter-  
part, keeps the oppressive laws  
and practices alive and denies  
women their rights but most of  
all life.

Some of the work on sale at  
the Brass Plum Co-op includes  
photography, pottery, jewelry,  
plants, clothing for infants to  
adults, candles, toys. The store  
accepts merchandise on consign-  

ment from people who do not  
wish to become members of the  
co-op. Their consignment per-  
centage is the lowest in town.  
Anyone who may want to sell  
their work at the Brass Plum  
should bring a sample to a  
general meeting held on the  
second and fourth Wednesdays  
of every month at 5 in the  
evening at the store.

If you want to become a  
member of the co-op you  
needn't worry about elitism and  
hidden power structures. This  
co-op functions on an equali-  
tarian basis. This co-op denies  
shiny, slick, chic stores addi-  
tional income from high consign-  
ment image peddling. It destroys  
the parasitic relationship be-  
tween sellers and buyers and  
producers, insures the buyer  
high quality work and fine craft  
work at half the price, and  
dilutes the fragmentation and  
mystery of the artist's life.

Women Must Control  
Own Medical Destiny  

Barbara Hume  

The other day I picked up  
Milestones in Midwifery  
expecting to find this book  

filled with all sorts of wonderful  
things about those women  
throughout history who have  
given so much of what little  
medical care there was. Instead,  
once again, I was face to face  
with the reality of life as a  
woman. This 1967 book from  
England, a country where  
females still play a central role  
in midwifery, is by a man about  
men. Why does this book  
mention only two women? What  
can we do about it? And what  
implications does this hold for  
the Women's Movement in  
general? The answer to why this  
book is so male oriented is  
subtly provided by the author,  
Walter Radcliffe, himself. Both  
surgical techniques and  
education were the carefully  
guarded rights of men only  
historically. Of forceps,  
Radcliffe says: “...the young  
surgeons who wanted to be in  
the fashion by taking up  
midwifery...wanted to know all  
they could about the new  
forceps, which gave them a  
skill—and a weapon—which the  

midwives could not claim.”  
Though forceps and other  
surgical techniques certainly  

played a crucial role in barring  
women from the changing field  
of obstetrics, such a simple  
explanation alone does not  
satisfy why Radcliffe can claim  
all the milestones for men.  
Women were excluded from  
education at all levels. This  
meant that most midwives could  
not read or write, and so could  
not communicate their learning  
to the educated world of men.  
Thus Radcliffe is able to claim  
the use of ergot as a milestone  
for men though the female  
midwives had been using it for  
centuries before some man  
finally noticed and published his  
“new” discovery.  

No Credit  

Ergot is a parasitic fungus which  
grows on grain and in its refined  
forms is still one of the most  
important drugs in obstetrics. It  
hastens prolonged labors and  
helps the clamping down of the  
uterus after delivery to slow  
hemorrhage. Even Radcliffe  
admits that German midwives  
used it in prolonged labor, but  
he gives the credit not to the  
women who long saved lives  
with it, but to the man who  
wrote about it. We can help put  

women back into their properly  
central role in the care of their  
bodies by correcting these two  
still existent problems. This  
century has seen no increase in  
the number of women in  
medical school. Sometimes I  
think this is because women are  
too intelligent to submit  
themselves to the inhumane  
atmosphere of medical  
education today. However,  
reality dictates that as long as  
the doctor is the power  
possessor in the medical world  
instead of one member of a  
good team, we need female  
doctors—lots of them. We need  
female doctors to help reverse  
the servant roles now so much a  
part of the hierarchy. We need  
female doctors who know the  
feeling of uterine cramps as  
directly as male doctors who  
know the ache of a scrotal  
injury. We also need male  
nurses. What of that majority of  
women not in medicine? There  
is nothing which keeps medical  
personnel more alert than a  
well-informed patient who asks  
intelligent questions.  

Publish or Perish?  

The what to do about  
“publish or perish” is clearly  
important in the female-male  
battle as well as in the more  
strictly academic world.  
Education is fairly open to us  
now. Individuals and women’s  
groups can use this tool to  
rewrite the history books and to  
research more effective and  
humane techniques in women’s  
medicine, and medicine in  
general. Barbara Ehrenreich and  
Deirdre English have begun to  
counter the male version of  
history in their pamphlet,  
Witches, Midwives, and Nurses.  
This extremely important bit of  
historical research reveals for  
instance that at the time  
midwives were outlawed in this  
country, it was not as we have  
always been told, because these  
uneducated women were less  
competent. In fact, a study by  
Johns Hopkins professor in 1972  
indicated that most American  
doctors were less competent  
than the midwives. Not only  
were the doctors themselves  
unreliable about preventing  
sepsis and ophthalmia but they  
also tended to be too ready to  
use surgical techniques which  
endangered mother or child. If  
anyone, then, deserved a legal  
monopoly on obstetrical care, it  
was the midwives, not the MDs.  
But the doctors had power the  
midwives didn’t.  

The self-help groups  
around the country;  
groups of women putting out  
such fine materials as Our  
Bodies, Our Selves; groups  
lobbying for less restrictive  
legislation of nurses, midwives  
and other paramedics; groups  
like the La Leche League who  
daily combat questionable  
obstetric and pediatric  
practices—these are the primary

up registration packets. The  
keynote speaker, Ms. Mamie  
Moore, Assoc. Director of  
Women and Minority Affairs  
of the Day Care and Child  
Development Council of  
America, began half an hour  
late and took an additional  
ten minutes to tell us about  
the gas lines in the East,  
(perhaps she thought there  
are no newspapers or  
televisions here in the West).  

Wrong Place?  

When that ended, my  
group was told we were in  
the wrong place. A  
messenger from the  
organizers came running in  
to assure us that, no, we  
were not in the wrong place,  
and if we would stay put we  
would be entertained/educated  
with a movie. Except there was no  
sound for the movie. And  
when they got sound, it was  
so scratchy we could only oc-  
casionally understand it. If I  
were just a bit more cynical  
than I already am, I would  
have deduced that those  
stereotypes are right: women  
really are incapable of run-  
ning things.  

The morning/afternoon  
discussion groups that I  
either participated in or  
heard reports about ran the  
gamut from the ludicrous to  
the boring. Again, my more  
charitable side says that  
some people, women and  
men, may not have ever  
thought about stereotyping  
and its concomitant problem  
of discrimination. I didn't  
happen to run into any of  
those people.  

The day’s highlight, and  
only bright spot, was Rep. Pat  
Schroeder's lunchtime ad-  
dress. Congresswoman  
Schroeder is a delight to  
listen to, for her boundless  
enthusiasm and energy if no-  
thing else. Congress is one of  
the more stultifyingly serious  
institutions around. To hear  
an actual participant joke and  
laugh about it, while also  
learning about the position of  
pro-women legislation, was  
gratifying.  

Point for Trying  

The conference  
deserves some points for try-  
ing. Coordinators, Jules  
Loventhal and Dr. Sara G.  
Zimet, obviously put a  
tremendous amount of work  
into planning: some twenty-  
one local, state and national  
organizations “provided  
either or both financial and  
moral support.” We were  
given some helpful pamph-  
lets on Denver resources in  
overcoming stereotyping and  
on the national laws on dis-  
crimination in educational  
institutions. A couple of dis-  
cussion groups on dis-  
crimination and the law held  
some promise, although I  
was unable to find anyone  
who attended them. Twice as  
many people (more than  
600) attended than had been  
expected. Yet on the whole,  
the conference was a crush-  
ing disappointment.  

The Women’s Defense Com-  
mittee was formed on January  
12, 1974, at a meeting held at  
the Gay Community Services  
Center in Los Angeles. Activities  
on the committee include mem-  
bers of the Tide Collective,  
National Organization for Wo-  
men, Westside Lesbian Femin-  
ists, The Gay Community Ser-  
vices Center, and the Gay  
Sisterhood at UCLA.  

The purpose of the WDC is to  
raise money for court cases  
dealing with Lesbian and Femin-  
ist oppression, and to build  
public support toward these  
causes.  

The committee is presently  
working on two separate cases.  
Lynda Chaffin has lost custody  
of her two daughters, ages 11  
and 13, to her parents because  
she is a Lesbian. Marie Nunes  
lost her job because she could  
not maintain her security clear-  
ance when it was discovered she  
was a Lesbian.  

Support is needed in the form  
of money, publicity, and women  
who can give their time. Anyone  
interested in donating money,  
please send checks made payable

Harpies Bizarre

Rita Williams as Rinso White.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 7

Sharon Niederman expounds upon welfare motherhood.

“We wanted to hit them pow, pow, pow, pow,” explained one of
the performers, relaxing and still out of breath following the
rehearsal. And Harpies’ Bizarre, which played at the Changing Scene in
early April, did exactly that. 

Comprised of eight brief segments, the play barraged its audience
with statements about women and women’s roles.

The performance of Harpies’ Bizarre marked the debut of the Great
Grand Daughters of the American Revolution (GGDAR). The group,
made up of local feminists Marilee Long Saxe, Sharon Niederman, and
Rita Williams, wrote, directed, and performed the play.

Costumed in vibrant hot pink leotards and multi-colored
patchwork skirts, the trio sang, danced, and presented their poetry to
Denver viewers. With action that ranged from straightforward to
highly stylized, they focused first on one woman’s problems then on
another's pride.

Mother and daughters, wives and waitresses expressed themselves
through Harpies’ Bizarre. Three monologues, “Welfare” by Nieder-
man, “Waitress” by Williams, and “Mothers” by Saxe, provided
glimpses of disillusioned women who were either out of work or
bitter about their jobs.

Relying on a minimum of props and a maximum of energy, the
segment “Rinso White” became effective satire on women as
girlfriends, mothers, and housewives.

Somewhat more abstract, the “Ashgrove” and “Hist ye Gossips”
explored woman through poetry. These segments dealing with the
moods and sensitivities of women seemed somehow to wrap the
others into perspective and the play into an aesthetic, cohesive whole.

Harpies’ Bizarre, GGDAR explained in a Denver Post interview,
consists of “our own thoughts and views of the world.” But even
more, they emphasized, the play is an example that women can create
successfully together.

The group indicated that they are available for performance,
though they do require payment.

Hot Times...

down from “faggot,” although both imply you are not playing your
socially assigned sex role... are not therefore a “real woman” or a
“real man.” The grudging admiration felt for the tomboy, and the
queasiness felt around a sissy boy point to the same thing: the
contempt in which women—or those who play a female role—are
held. And the investment in keeping women in the contemptuous
role is very great. Lesbian is the word, the label, the condition that
holds women in line. When a woman hears this word tossed her way,
she knows she is stepping out of line. Lesbian is a label invented by
the Man to throw at any woman who dares to assert the primacy of
her own needs.

Divides Humanity

“Lesbian” is one of the sexual categories by which men have divided
up humanity. While all women are dehumanized as sex objects, as
the objects of men they are given certain compensations... Should a
woman confront herself by confronting another woman, there are
fewer rationalizations, fewer buffers by which to avoid the stark
horror of her dehumanized condition. Herein we find the overriding
fear of many women toward being used as a sexual object by a
woman, which not only will bring her no male-connected compensations,
but also will reveal the void which is woman's real situation.
This dehumanization is expressed when a straight woman learns that
a sister is a Lesbian; she begins to relate to her Lesbian sister as her
potential sex object, laying a surrogate male role on the Lesbian...
For women, especially those in the movement, to perceive their Lesbian
sisters through this male grid of role definitions is to accept this
male cultural conditioning and to oppress their sisters much as they
themselves have been oppressed by men.

Women in the movement have in most cases gone to great lengths to
avoid discussion and confrontation with the issue of Lesbianism....
But it is no side issue. It is absolutely essential to the success and
fulfillment of the Women’s Liberation Movement that this issue be
dealt with. As long as the label “dyke” can be used to frighten a
woman into a less militant stand, keep her separate from her sisters,
keep her from giving primacy to anything other than men and family—
then to that extent she is controlled by the male culture. Until
women see in each other the possibility of a primal commitment
which includes sexual love, they will be denying themselves the love
and value they readily accord to men, thus affirming their second

class status. As long as male acceptability is primary—both to in-
dividual women and to the movement as a whole—the term Lesbian
will be used effectively against women.

... It also should be said that some younger, more radical women
have honestly begun to discuss Lesbianism, but so far it has been
primarily as a sexual “alternative” to men. This, however, is still giving
primacy to men, both because the idea of relating more completely
to women occurs as a negative reaction to men, and because the Les-
bian relationship is being characterized simply by sex, which is
divisive and sexist. On one level, which is both personal and political,
women may withdraw emotional and sexual energies from men, and
work out various alternatives for those energies in their own lives. On
a different political/psychological level, it must be understood that
what is crucial is that women begin disengaging from male-defined
response patterns. In the privacy of our own psyches, we must cut
those cords to the core. For irrespective of where our love and sexual
energies flow, if we are male-identified in our heads, we cannot
realize our autonomy as human beings.

Self-Hate

... The consequence of internalizing this role (of male-defined sexual
and family functions) is an enormous reservoir of self-hate. This is not
to say the self-hate is recognized or accepted as such; indeed most
women would deny it. It may be experienced as discomfort with her
role, as feeling empty, as numbness, as restlessness, as a paralyzing
anxiety at the center. Alternatively, it may be expressed in shrill
defensiveness of the glory and destiny of her role. But it does exist,
often beneath the edge of her consciousness, poisoning her ex-
istence, keeping her alienated from herself, her own needs, and
rendering her a stranger to other women. They try to escape by iden-
tifying with the oppressor, living through him, gaining status and iden-
tity from his ego, his power, his accomplishments. And by not iden-
tifying with other “empty vessels” like themselves. Women resist
relating on all levels to other women who will reflect their own oppres-
sion, their own secondary status, their own self-hate. For to confront
another woman is finally to confront one’s self—the self we have
gone to such lengths to avoid. And in that mirror we know we cannot
really respect and love that which we have been made to be.

... It is very difficult to realize and accept that being “feminine” and
being a whole person are irreconcilable. Only women can give to each
other a new sense of self. That identity we have to develop with
reference to ourselves, and not in relation to men. This conscious-
ness is the revolutionary force from which all else will follow, for ours
is an organic revolution.

For this we must be available and supportive to one another, give our
commitment, and our love, give the emotional support necessary to
sustain this movement. Our energies must flow toward our sisters,
not backward toward our oppressors. As long as Women’s Liberation
tries to free women without facing the basic heterosexual structure
that binds us in one-to-one relationships with our oppressors,
tremendous energies will continue to flow into trying to straighten up
each particular relationship with a man, into finding how to get better
sex, how to turn his head around—into trying to make the “new man”
out of him, in the delusion that this will allow us to be the “new
woman.” This obviously splits our energies and commitments, leaving
us unable to be committed to the construction of the new patterns
which will liberate us.

... It is the primacy of women relating to women, of women creating a
new consciousness of and with each other, which is at the heart of
Women’s Liberation, and the basis for the cultural revolution... We
see ourselves as prime, find our centers inside of ourselves. We find
receding the sense of alienation, of being cut off, of being behind a
locked window, of being unable to get out what we know is inside. We
feel a realness, feel at last we are coinciding with ourselves. With
that real self, with that consciousness, we begin a revolution to end
the imposition of all coercive identifications, and to achieve maximum
autonomy in human expression.

We would again like to re-emphasize that both Lesbians and straight
women are in different stages of consciousness at different times.
Consciousness raising must be done with this difference in mind,
remembering that there are countless ways to reach the objective of all
women’s culture and all women’s efforts should be encouraged in this
direction.

divisive. I'll take issue with
anything my sisters say that I
feel is a misconception, but I
don’t hate women for these
misconceptions—only the
misconceptions themselves.
Denouncing someone per-
sonally because of their
thinking is, I feel, very much a
male trait. We must re-define
and re-think the world within
our own minds, our own lives
and our own experience—
and in our own terms. And if
we can’t do it positively and
with love, why are we doing it
at all?

While these women
speak of separatism, I
challenge their separatism
and their feminism. I live in a
house that I have built
myself, heated with wood
from trees I have felled
myself, loaded, hauled, saw-

ed and split myself. I service
my own car and work for a
company that is owned and
operated by a woman and
staffed almost exclusively by
women. And I don’t like being
told that I'm not as good a
dyke as they are because I
don’t hate and don’t cut my
hair.

In short then, it’s alright
to not listen to what you say,
but to miss what you're doing
leads to trouble. Separatists,
where are you really at?
Where are we all? And how
do we bring it to where we
want it to be? Not without
love.

In sisterhood,

Dear Sisters,

Nothing aggravates me or
frustrates me more than being
ripped off on repairs or work
done on my car because of my
sex. Well, it’s happened again
and this time it's particularly
depressing since it was to the
tune of $103. I’ve truly had it
and shed enough tears this time
to do something about it. But
first of all let me share some
things with you and warn you.

I've related my recent
experience to several male
friends who have told me of gas
station attendants who used to
brag about how when a woman
came in, they would disconnect
some wire or other and charge
her $10 just to stick it back in.
As for checking the oil, many of
the ladies who asked an
attendant to check it were told
the car was down a quart when
it was actually on full—then an
empty can would be brought
out, pretending to put it in and
collect the money. My
roommate and I were rapping
the other night and she told me
of a gas station she had been
going to for well over a year and
knew the people in a friendly
fashion. She brought her car in
for engine work and was ripped off by these “friendly”
dudes who replaced a part not
needed to be replaced.

I could go on forever. My
friends, please, please take the
time to at least learn the
minimum about your cars. It’s
time we stopped being ripped
off by these dishonest,
conniving fellows who as far as
I'm concerned are the lowest.
Take no one’s word for anything
and have things checked by two
or three different people before
making any major repairs
(mistakes).

I'd really like to hear from
you about any suggestions for
me (us) in taking care of my car
myself or what to watch for in
being ripped off as you may
have also been.

God bless all in our struggle
for equality and peace and
liberation. Peace,

Patty Kemmeter

Women and  
the Arts  

The apathy of the Denver  
public, galleries, and museums is  
stifling potential creativity; and  
offering, virtually, a dead-end  
road to women.  

In cities responsive to art,  
women have been able to  
successfully fight the  
mainstream and have built a  
creative and competitive force.  

Womanspace, a Los Angeles  
art center for women, was  
originated by L.A. women in  
January, 1972. According to the  
Women’s Survival Catalogue,  
this is the first comprehensive  
West Coast exhibition space for  
women.  

Womanspace has members  
from all over the states, and  

offers unprecedented services  
and nurturance to Feminist  
artists. For twelve dollars a year,  
Womanspace members are  
offered: a slide registry,  
exhibition and voting  

privileges; and a subscription to  
Womanspace Journal.  

Other benefits available to  
L.A. women include lectures,  
workshops, and exhibitions in  
all of the fine arts. Sometime in  
the future Womanspace may  
also put on traveling exhibitions.  

Another organization outside  
of Denver which is beneficial is  
the Slide Registry. A woman  
may send up to four slides of  
her work to the registry along  
with information regarding her  
work and herself. This  
information then becomes  
available to participating artists,  
galleries, and curators. The  
W.E.B. (West-East Bag) area  
representative maintains the  
registry. Our area rep is the art  
department at the University of  
Colorado.  

Women’s art centers,  
collective and non-collective in  
membership, have sprung up in  

many cities, including: the  
Chicago Women's Graphic  
Collective, Powerhouse in  

Montreal, Women’s Art Center  
in St. Louis, AJI.R. in New  
York, and centers in  
Connecticut, Ohio,  
Pennsylvania, California, and  
Massachusetts.  

The  

non-collective  
charge a twenty to thirty per  
cent commission on works sold.  
(The average is 40 per cent.)  
Along with the art centers a  
good number of film, video, and  

theatre collectives have  
blossomed. All of these help  
bring women’s art into the  
community where it belongs.  

Denver is far behind these  
towns but some constructive  
effort is being made.  

The Thread Co., a group of  
five Denver women who pooled  
their resources and minds,  
consists of Nancy Campbell,  
Susan Cole, Nancy Deveraux,  
Pauline Olsen, and Karen White.  
These women have taken all  
kinds of fibers and turned away  
from conventional crafts to fiber  
sculpture.  

A Denver collective is now  
also being organized. They meet  
weekly at 1895 Lafayette St.  
Call Kim at 355-8950 or Ghigui  
at 756-4377 for detailed  
information.  

Although it is hard for any  
kind of serious fine art to  
blossom in Denver, it is good to  
know that a few women are  
accepting the challenge and are  
getting down to work instead of  
complaining.

“I'll Be a  

Banker”  

In working-class Irish  
Catholic Boston, even today a  
Feminist is a woman who  
asks her husband to dry the  

dishes sometimes. Few of  

the daughters in that white  
ghetto where I grew up es-  
caped; when I am in Boston  
visiting friends and relatives I  
find my childhood friends all  

living just blocks from their  

parents and sending their  
children to the same  
parochial schools they went  
to.  

To most of them, I am a  
Radical Feminist. They are a  
long way, both geograph-  
ically and emotionally, from  
my woman friends here in  
Denver who are exploring the  
possibilities of self-recognition.  
The one question I have  
been asked by both groups of  
women is why I have chosen  
to try to break into finance.  
The answer doesn’t come  
easily.  

Painful Choice  

In a few months I will  
graduate from the University  
with a degree in finance and  
have put out the first feelers  
toward a position as an of-  
ficer in a local bank. It was a  
painful decision at best to  
make that choice and I can  
only trace its making back a  
year to another night in April  
when I listened to a strong  
and courageous Feminist talk  
about power.  

I went to interview  
Florynce Kennedy with other  
BMR staffers there and in-  
stead of an interview got an  

amazing dose of realism. I  
had spent my few years as a  
Feminist listening to people  
talk about collective vs.  
hierarchies and group  
strength vs. individual  
power, but in Kennedy, I was  
confronted with a woman  
talking about personal power  
being used to open doors and  
about the foolishness of  
denying one’s strengths to  
help each other.  

For the first time I un-  
derstood why I felt cheated in  
classes where the professor  
had opted out of a leadership  
position in the classroom.  
Because, (let's face it), they  
still gave out the grades all  
the while they were denying  
they had anything to teach.  

One of the basic truths of  
life may be that the strength  
to help other people is direct-  
ly proportional to the  
strength you have to help  
yourself. It may seem like a  
very simple truth but its  
application changed my style  
of life.  

Soc-Fem.-Maoist?  

I have found it threaten-  
ing to have someone ask  
what my politics are. The  
people who ask this question  
all seem to expect simple  
definitive answers which I  
don't have. I have long wish-  
ed I had a ready answer like,  
“I, my friend, am a Socialist-  
Feminist with Maoist  
leanings.” (I heard someone  
describe herself like that  
once and couldn't decide  
whether I was impressed or  
scared).  

It's not a problem,  
anymore. I am a woman who  
believes in the power and  
strength of women, who  
would like to see America as  
a female culture. I see no  
dichotomy between that and  
my wish to work toward that  
end by opening doors for  
others with my own personal  
money-achieved powers. To  
those who have asked me  
what I will do, “after the  
revolution,” I answer again,  
“I'll be a banker.”  
Revolutions, contrary to a  
widely-held daydream, do  
not turn countries into  
agrarian paradises. CPAs,  
bankers, pilots, mothers, file-  
clerks, and grocery checkers  
need apply.  

Dropping out is not the answer;  
fucking up is. Most women are  
already dropped out; they were  
never in. Dropping out gives  
control to those few who don’t  
drop out; dropping out is  
exactly what the establishment  
leaders want; it plays into the  
hands of the enemy; it  
strengthens the system instead  
of undermining it, since it is based  
entirely on the nonparticipation,  
passivity, apathy, and  
non-involvement of the mass of  
women. Dropping out, however,  
is an excellent policy for men,  
and SCUM will enthusiastically  
encourage it. — Valerie Solanas,  
Scum Manifesto.

High School Women:  
Denver Career Fair Sexist  

Becky Bohannan  

A Career Exploration Fair  

descended upon Denver March  
11-15. Its purpose was to give  
high school and junior high  
students a chance to discover  
what they want to do in life.  
The information booklet that  
was available to students stated,  
“Career education...will help  
you know yourself better. What  
are you like? What do you want  
out of life?” These worthy goals  
ended up on the floor of  
Currigan Hall along with soda  
cans, straws and papers to be  
swept into trash cans and  
eventually buried. For Explo ‘74  
as it was called, did not allow  
students to answer the question  
“what shall I do with my life?”  
But instead things went more  
along the line of, “Since I am a  
girl what shall I do?” and “Since  
I am a boy what shall I do?”  

Little Effort  

Little noticeable effort was  
made to interest teenagers in  
any career outside their  
traditional roles.  

The information booklet  
students received was blatantly  
sexist. Throughout the booklet  
were sketches of persons in  
various occupations. On the  
front and back cover were  
construction workers, a taxi cab  
driver, a doctor and many others  
all of whom were male. Not one  
woman was on the cover. Inside  
the booklet women were  
depicted in the usual role of  
nurse, secretary, model,  
stewardess, and housekeeper.  
Possibly the worst sketch  
showed a woman standing on a  
chair, raising her skirt and  
screaming at a mouse on the  
floor. The sketch above it  
showed a man exterminating a  
bug. How are we ever going to  
successfully combat sexism  
when students are supplied with  
information such as this? At the  
fair booths and displays were set  
up with representatives from  
practically every imaginable  
occupation. I talked with people  
in careers traditionally occupied  
by men. All those I talked with  
were men and any pictures at  
the displays of people in that  
particular field were of men.  
This also held true for fields  
generally occupied by women. I  
first talked with a man from a  
large engineering firm, who told  
me that only three women at  
the Denver plant held positions  
other than secretarial work.

kind of engineer he replied,  
“Well, if you want to become a  
lab technician...” Of course lab  
technician is about the only  
occupation in the field of  
engineering that employs  
women to any extent. He then  
said only two “girls had been  
by to discuss engineering with  
him and they were school  
teachers, one of whom was just  
collecting information to give to  
her class. He went on to say that  
usually when girls walk by a  
display that’s full of engineering  
equipment, they don’t know  
what it is so they're not  
interested. At the brick laying  
exhibit the man I talked with  
said no women were actually  
laying bricks but of course they  
did have secretaries. Three  
women had applied for a job  
though only one was called and  
she made no response and so  
lost it. When asked what he  
would say to a teenage girl who  
wanted to become a brick layer,  
he answered, “A lot of people  
think brick laying is just laying a  
brick but she’d have to be able  
to lift heavy brick slabs. And the  
language men use on the job  
isn’t always the best.”  

Men Entertained?  

Insurance is a more open field  
for women, according to the  
man I talked with. He said a  
number of women worked in  
each department but, only a  
couple were department heads.  
Few women were in his position  
though which was senior  
marketing representative. The  
reason he said was that married  
women don’t like to travel on  
business. I asked him if he was  
married. He said he was. He then  
went on to say that many men  
find it uncomfortable to be  
entertained by a woman on  
business. “But,” he added, “if  
you’re intelligent, we want  
you.” I asked two veterinarians  
how many women in the Denver

area are veterinarians. They  

started counting on their fingers,  
“Oh...two...three...who's that  
other girl...?” They finally came  
up with six definitely and  
maybe seven or eight. They  
admitted that it’s more difficult  
for women to get into Colorado  
State University’s veterinary  
school. But the situation has  
improved in the last few years  
with the number of women  
rising from three or four to  
twenty out of about ninety in  
the School of Veterinary  
Medicine. Many young women  
expressed interest in the law  
display. That field has opened  
up some in the last few years.  
One of the lawyers at the  
display was a woman. This was  
the only male dominated  
occupation that made any effort  
to reach young women. After  
experiencing so much sexism, I  
was extremely happy and  
surprised to learn that the  
Denver Women’s Resource  
Center had a table where  
information and counseling was  
available. Right next to it was a  
table with information on  
women's studies classes being  
held at various local colleges.  
This small oasis was a much  
needed respite from the sexist  
atmosphere at the career  
fair.  

Traditional Roles  

Few of Explo’s organizers and  
career representatives tried to  
reach students and interest them  
in occupations outside of their  
traditional roles. But even those  
that made an effort got little  
response (except law). It would  
have been possible to tolerate all  
the chauvinistic remarks and  
sexist displays if the students  
themselves had rejected it. But  
instead they did just the  
opposite. Young women  
crowded around the  
cosmetology, modeling and  
secretarial displays while the  
boys were at the engineering,  
construction and automotive

booths. The majority seemed to  
accept their traditional role with  
no noticeable rebellion. What is  
going to happen to this  
generation of teenagers? Will we  
be content with our parents’  
world and do nothing to change  
it? If this career fair was any  
indication, that’s exactly what  
we are going to do!  

Free To Be  

The career fair could have been  
a celebration of freedom. Free-  
dom to be what we want to be  
and do what we want to do  
instead of what society dictates.  
Unless teenagers are encouraged  
to break out of their roles, the  
majority of them are going to be  

content to stay where it's  
comfortable. Then just like  
many of their parents, years  

later they'll regret they didn’t  
do more with their lives. Explo  
'74 had the chance to be  
something great. Something  
never before done. Instead, it  
would have been better if it had  
never happened because now a  
few students who maybe were  
contemplating breaking out of  
their role have been reassured  
that such a drastic move is not  

necessary.

forces pounding away at the  
narrowness of U.S. medicine  
today.  

Working for these groups,  

researching and developing an  
even larger body of knowledge  
with which to change what is  
poor but keeping the best parts  
of medical knowledge, will  
continue to shape the medical  
care we receive tomorrow. Both  
the organization and the  
scientific content of medicine  
are open to challenge. If a  
women’s group develops a new  
idea (like vacuum extraction of  
menses) we should not just  
accept the discovery without  
question, but should keep our  
minds open to exploring both  
the positive and negative aspects  
of the new discoveries. By  
continual self-criticism and  
education we will revolutionize  
our health care and be ready  
with a better system if our  
government is ever replaced with  
a system in which better ideas  
can flourish. In this as in other  
areas of the Women’s  
Movement, knowledge is the  
first step toward gaining power  
to control our own lives. It is  
much more difficult for a doctor  
to treat you poorly if you know  
enough to ask pointed questions  
at the crucial time, or to  
recognize an omission or error.  
It is much more difficult for the  
legislature to pass poor health  
programs or prejudicial licensing  
acts if a large body of informed  
women is questioning their  
actions. It is more difficult for  
men to retain power in any area  
if we know how and why they  
attained that power or  
position.
