DULUTH WOMEN

by Pat Monaghan

Down the alley behind the  
Duluth YWCA, there is a small  
building--no more seedy-look-  
ing than most in that time-  
worn neighborhood--with a  
barn-red door.

Inside, stairs lead to an  
airy office and lounge. The  
freshly-painted walls are  
still bare; a desk, several  
chairs and a few bookshelves  
are scattered across the  
wooden floor. The high win-  
dows look over grey downtown  
Duluth to the historic aerial  
bridge.

Because Duluth is a city  
where I spent some important  
years, and because I still  
have a sore spot in my heart  
for that unfashionable old  
city, my curiosity had been  
piqued when a friend (dis-  
dainfully noting that she  
"didn't need that sort of  
stuff") told me that Duluth  
had a struggling women's cen-  
ter. So on my next northern  
visit I located the center  
and its coordinator, Kay  
Slick.

She began apologetically,  
explaining that things had  
"just been a mudpie" all sum-  
mer, and that the center was  
just beginning its fall pro-  
gramming. At her office in  
a corner of the center's  
front room--the rest is work-  
space and a rudimentary li-  
brary--Kay described the  
center's history and plans  
for the public opening next  
month.

It has been nearly two  
years since Duluth women  
first recognized a need for  
a women's center, Kay related.  
The idea was tossed around by  
local women’s groups and  

concerned individuals; a  
successful women's confer-  
ence last year gave added  
impetus to the proposal.  
Then, last year, activist  
Kris Nelson began organi-  
zing the center through EPI  
EPIC (Educational Project  
Involving Consumers), a fed-  
erally-funded program oper-  
ating out of the Duluth med-  
ical school. When Kris left  
EPIC, Kay took over the po-  
sition and continued agita-  
ting for a center.

Last spring the YWCA of-  
fered use of the roomy but  
run-down Decker Building on  
a rent-free basis for a year,  
with rent to be negotiated  
thereafter. The building  
seemed too big for the pro-  
posed center, but another  
group volunteered to use the  
downstairs for a day-care  
center, and the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center became a tan-  
gible reality.

Repairs--originally esti-  
mated at nearly $1600 for  
materials and labor--were  
executed at enormous saving  
by Duluth women who sanded  
floors, painted and other-  
wise assisted the renovation  
effort. Since that flurry  
of activity, however, the  
center has been struggling.

"I wouldn't say there's a  
high feminist consciousness  
in Duluth," said Kay Slick  
wearily. "There's a need for  
advocacy, a need for rape  
counseling, a need for var-  
ious referrals. But there's  

nothing here yet that women  
can identify with as a wo-  
man's thing."

Kay sees the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center as offering “an  
alternative to women who  
see themselves as being  
locked in" to traditional  
female roles, but admitted  
"it's hard to reach those  
women--they're still afraid  
to come here."

To Kay, part of the prob-  
lem in generating support is  
"the exceptional woman thing.  
I know a lot of women who are  
personally strong, but they  
don't see themselves as need-  
ing the center." Nonetheless  
she feels that “the city does  
need a women's center. We  
just don't know who the wo-  
men are that need us, or wh  
where they are."

Projects begun by the cen-  
ter, in addition to con-  
sciousness-raising sessions  
and related groups, include a  
weekly radio program, a dance  
class, and an ad hoc referral  
service for lawyers and doc-  
tors.

Kay described abortion  
counseling as "shallow,  
fragmented and underground”  
in Duluth, pointing out that  
only one abortion had been  
performed there since the Su-

preme Court ruling last win-  
ter. Duluth women must seek  
abortions in the Twin Cities  
area; younger women have dif-  
ficulty finding birth con-  
trol services as well.

Kay Slick feels isolated,  
"bleak but not really dis-  
couraged," she explained.  
"Women here still see the  
women's movement as being  
external to their lives. Right  
now we're still really into a  
self thing, heavy self-exam-  
ination, thinking about how  
being a woman is affecting  
our lives. But we need the  
women's center, even if its  
function is confined entirely  
to offering personal support."

STAR? FEMINISM HAS NO STARS!

Two Letters Respond to  
Minnesota Feminist Article  

IDEALS OF FEMINISM DIE  

Dear Sisters:  

I read with interest the article "Pro-active  
Women--Minnesota Feminists Born" in the  
August issue. As an active member of Minn-  
esota Feminists (formerly University of  
Minnesota Women's Liberation) who is also  

in the Young Socialist Alliance, I feel I  
must counter certain biases presented.  

The spokesperson for Minnesota Feminists  
stated Minnesota Feminists was formed be-  
cause "there were the negative feelings of  
the group (Women's Liberation) being a YSA  
front, a clique that was meeting the needs  
of only four or five women." There were  
several allegations in the article that Wom-  
en's Liberation was not responsive to the  
needs of women. A brief review of last  
year's activities is needed:  

University of Minnesota Women's Libera-  
tion won the fight with the University  
Health Service, winning pap smears and preg-  
nancy tests at no extra charge, abortion re-  
ferrals and counseling, an ombudsperson, and  
in-service staff training to make health  
service employees more sensitive to women  
and the need to treat us in a non-sexist,  
non-patronizing manner.  

We continued our work with women's stud-  
ies--an idea that originated in our group  
and grew into the existing women's studies  
program.  

We picketed two public hospitals which  
refused to give women abortions.  

We sent speakers to high schools, college  
classrooms and community groups.  

We sponsored "The New Feminism Conference:  
Cultural, Political and Educational Impli-  
cations", which involved almost 30 pro-fem-  
ale groups in the city--10 of which directly  
participated in planning meetings, along  
with individuals from high schools and the  
community. Over 300 people attended the  
conference.  

We sponsored a women's fair and film fes-  
tival with over 100 people attending.  

We presented various educationals through-  
out the year.  

Now, just whose needs were not being met?  
Certainly, Women's Liberation was responsive  
to the needs of campus and community women  
by leading struggles for better health care,  
better education and abortion rights.  

To say "the number of women's needs being  
met were almost nil" implies a serious dis-  
agreement on what the needs of women are.  
The "needs" of women can only  
be interpreted, in light of the article, to  
mean the individual needs of women in deal-  

ing with personal problems that arise from  
living in a sexist society. Individual  
needs are important--no one wishes to deny  
that. Women's Liberation has always made  
attempts to include consciousness-raising in  
the organization--some were successful, oth-  
ers were not.  

C-R and self-awareness groups are important  
factors in developing an understanding of  
our oppression, but they must not become  
isolated from activity--activity which also  
leads one's consciousness to higher levels.  
No woman, no matter how high her conscious-  
ness, or how deep her self-awareness, is  
free in a sexist society. Society's insti-  
tutions, be they religious, judicial, legis-  
lative, educational, medical or commercial,  
discriminate against women and promote the  
myth of our inferiority. To attack women  
(such as women in the YSA) who focus most  
of their energy on the broad, societal iss-  
ues that face us, is to lack perspective of  
the scope of the feminist struggle. Our  
fight goes beyond the level of individual  
solutions of coping in a sexist society: A  
tremendous amount of power must be generated  
to make society meet the needs of over one-  
half of its members.  

This is the basic issue of disagreement:  

How do we best build the women's movement?  
Is it by C-R and self-awareness groups or by  
organizing women around the issues that aff-  
ect our lives. Certainly, women who support  
the former are sincere in their beliefs, but  
I believe history will prove the latter stra-  
tegy correct--as it has in other struggles  
of the oppressed, such as the suffragist move  
ment.  

It is absurd to think that women who want to  
build a powerful women's movement would dis-  
courage anyone who is interested in belong-  
ing to a feminist organization and anyone  
who wants to develop organizational skills--  
skills that are vital in building a movement.  
Every woman is desperately needed to be a  
leader.  

Anyone who has taken on organizational re-  
sponsibility will understand problems org-  
anizers have: getting people to share re-  
sponsibility, to follow through with their  
commitments and to actively participate in  
the boring day-to-day survival responsibil-  
ities. People who have had such experiences  
will recognize the fallacy in the argument  
that organizers won't reach out to new  
people and won't teach new people skills--  
be they making leaflets or spending evenings  
on the phone raising money to writing press  
releases and holding news conferences. I  
was not born with any of these skills. I  
learned them from "older" members in Women's  
Liberation who were eager to develop new,  
continued on page 5 :

young leaders. Sharing organizational skills
and responsibilities is a two-way process—
people must want to learn. That desire
comes from a very real sense of the magni-
tude of the feminist struggle and the will-
ingness to dedicate much of one's time and
energy to tedious chores. That, in essence,
is the key to leadership. People who do not
fully understand the pressures and intrica-
cies of organizational work (because they
have not been in that position) obviously
cannot appreciate the perspective of active
organizers. The only way for them to learn
is to get their hands dirty with the chores
of responsibility—not just talk about ideas.
Implementation is the only standard by which
to judge the correctness of ideas and cor-
rectness makes for respected leadership.

Minnesota Feminists has inherited a fine
history of activism from Women's Liberation.
Strength and the ability to work effectively
around the issues that affect campus and
community women come from unity, not from
divisiveness on personal and political diff-
erences. My feelings at this point are ones
of extreme sadness. The feelings of many
women have been hurt. Some are YSA or Soci-
alist Workers Party members; others are wom-
en who also have been excluded from two
months of Minnesota Feminist meetings be-
cause they were considered to be too close
to members of the YSA on either a personal
or political level. That is not my defini-
tion of sisterhood. I think it's time this
divisiveness stops. We must concentrate our
efforts and energies on our real enemies,
not on each other.

Sincerely,

Becky Bohan

IDEALS OF FEMINISM DIE

I am not and have never been a member of
the Socialist Workers Party. Nonetheless,
I was lumped with the arbitrarily chosen
scapegoats, boxed in, and shoved out. I am
the victim of a purge of University of Minn-
esota Women's Liberation. My hopes about
sisterhood and the moral superiority of wom-
en have flown out the window. One whom I
once saw as a beloved sister, I now see as a
tragic power tripper.

The organization now called Minnesota Fem-
inists was not started this summer by twenty
dissatisfied women, as Jackie Byrd alleges.
It was started in 1971 during the student
strikes, under the name of University of
Minnesota Women's Liberation. Its purpose
was to meet and discuss the special needs of
women, which were not being met by the male-
dominated New Left, which Robin Morgan ref-
ers to as "The Boy's Movement." The organ-
ization has been extremely active and has
maintained its radical feminist line during
apathetic and hellsapoppin' political times.

One cannot accurately claim we met the
needs of only four or five women; or the
Socialist party. We have sponsored speak-
outs on rape, abortion, and day care. In the
1972-1973 school year we held campaigns for
legal abortion and exposed some of the
incompetent and dehumanizing gynecological
care women were getting at the University
health service. We demanded and got, with
the help of hundreds of righteously angry
women, pap smears at no additional charge,
pregnancy tests at no additional charge, and
an end to moral harassment at the hands of

certain gynecologists in the employ of the
University. In the same year, we sponsored,
with MWAAC, a conference and march for legal
abortion, both of which were attended by
several hundred people.

This past year our area of concentration
has been Women's Studies. Another victim of
exclusion, also not a socialist, developed
the idea for a course called "Feminism and
American Intellectual Life." The course
reached large numbers of women both in the
classroom and at the public lectures. One of
the seven speakers at the lectures was Robin
Morgan. Women's Liberation obtained a
Women's Studies Program at the University of
Minnesota, and we are determined to remain
available to agitate for more classes.

Women's Liberation has organized CR
groups and Women's Coalitions to lead anti-
war marches. Individually, we have been
involved in lobbying and letter writing cam-
paigns for the ERA, abortion, and we have
been involved in the political campaigns of
candidates from the Democrat and Socialist
parties. This spring we sponsored a confer-
ence featuring the great Flo Kennedy. (Who,
by the way, told us, "If you want to kick ass,
you've got to learn to aim high." She warned
us about "horizontal hostility," that is,
hostility toward one's equally oppressed
peers.) We also put on a Women's Fair and
Film Festival, providing an outlet to many
local female artists.

The activities we have sponsored have been
well attended and have turned thousands of
women on to the beauty of sisterhood. I
hope I have adequately illustrated that the
organization is not being run in the in-
terests of a few witches on red broomsticks
or some potentate in the Kremlin.

If things continue the way they have, the
organization may now be run in the interests
of one. It is amusing to the point of apop-
lexia to have Jackie declare, all innocent
of irony, "It doesn't do to have an organi-
zation that excludes women that are
different from us or doesn't think exactly
the way I think or someone else thinks."

Jackie Byrd met secretly all summer with
twenty women loosely connected with, but not
active in, Women's Liberation. The struct-
ural changes developed in these clandestine
meetings were not really changes, as I shall
illustrate. What was new was the undemo-
cratic way they were accomplished. Formerly
there had been a constant struggle to keep
the group non-exclusive. Not surprisingly,
some of the staunchest defenders of the
policy of non-exclusion were socialists.

With one exception, none of the ideas they
came up with were original. Task forces had
functioned most effectively on the issues of
the Health Service, Day Care, and Women's
Studies. As I already stated, Women's Lib-
eration was in favor of consciousness
raising groups and has sponsored them in the
past. We unfailingly held steering commit-
tee meetings to set policy and make the
agenda for meetings. The difference is that
then anyone who wanted to was encouraged to
attend. Now only elected CR 'representa-
tives' may attend! The one change which I
will remain opposed to is the institution
of "Star"

That these two women gained
fame through not seeking it

well, for those born under

with direct self-assertion.
Born under the zodiac's
sixth sign, the cautious and
hesitating Virgo woman is
further encouraged by social
conditioning to subject her-
self to others. The Virgo-
born are perfectionists who
seek order in their surroun-
dings; for the Virgo woman,
this often takes the form
of fanatic housecleaning and
slavish devotion to her fam-
ily. Society encourages the
Virgo woman to perform this
role; because it fills some
of her own needs, she
accepts it.

Q,

Virgo woman is encouraged to
develop her most negative
qualities: to sublimate her
passions, to dedicate her-
self wholly to others, to
modestly aid her "superiors"
without aiming at advance-
ment. This kind of Virgo
woman makes the perfect
secretary, nurse or house-
wife; she is neat, orderly,
restrained and unassuming.
She is also vaguely dis-
content, although not often
able to articulate her com-
plaints.

Looking over the impres-
sive list of Virgo women who,
while not household words,
established themselves as
leaders in their field, we
find that--like Sanger and
Addams--they chose fields
which fulfilled their need to
serve while not restricting
them to the file cabinet or
dust mop. There's Margaret
Anderson Watts, who founded a
home for indigent women; ed-
ucator Celestia Susannah Par-
rish; kindergarten organizer
Margarethe Meyer Schwez;
children's writer Rachel
Lyman Field; Sophia Smith,
founder of Smith College. An
impressive list, and one
which suggests that the Virgo
need not restrict herself to

by arcotts

servility, that the rendering
of service need not be done
at the expense of self-res-
pect.

The Virgo woman's sexuali-
ty is strong, though in our
restrictive society it is
often unexpressed or inhibi-
ted. An earth sign, Virgo's
reputed "barrenness" is that
of fields after harvest;
hers is a full and settled
sexuality that can lie dor-
mant until the proper con-
ditions present themselves.
Fastidious and sensitive
to nuance, the Virgo woman
can be discouraged by care-
less love-making; her sur-
prisingly strong sex drive
can then be sublimated into
an exaggeration of her Virgo
traits, producing a neuroti-
cally puritanical attitude.
In a society which encourages
her to develop her least
affirmative qualities, the
Virgo woman faces a challenge
indeed.

Other women born under
Virgo include "Grandma" Mo-
ses, Anna Ella Carroll, Irene
Lewisohn, Alice Stone Black-
well, Caroline Hamilton Pier,
Dame Edith Sitwell, Hilda
Doolittle (HD) and Mary God-
win Shelley.

talking to one strong woman in the group and
calling her 'president', etc. The idea
seems to have lost some humor in the transi-
tion. There were to be three stars, who
were picked by lottery, and they were to
have no vote as to the policy they represent.
Amazingly enough, the only person who cared
to be the star was none other than Ms. Byrd.
She has violated the spirit in which Minne-
sota Feminists accepted the idea, and
furthermore has been out of town for a week
at a time when the press wished to reach
her. We may as well be calling her Madame
President. Because the whole idea is oppos-
ed to the democratic ideals of feminism, and
because its power has been abused from its
inception, I am opposed to it.

We have all learned many lessons from
this power grab. Partly that the Women's
movement is not immune to cheap political
shenanigans, and that victims tend to come
from a time-honored list of outgroups: pick
your own scapegoat. We must continue to
struggle to keep the women's movement non-
exclusive, because too many of us are poten-
tial victims of exclusiveness. The big
lesson I have been forced to accept from my
formerly beloved sister, is that a woman's
politics have nothing to do with her inte-
grity.

There's going to be a "cooperative" con-
ference on Sept. 28-30 in Mpls. People from
all over will be there and who knows what
will happen. Most of the workshops will be
planned when everyone gets to the People's
Center, 20th and Riverside, on Fri. night.

I work at a food coop and the only reason
I'm planning to go is because some women
will be organizing, probably around noon Sat
(place to be arranged). We are hoping that
we can meet each other and share our experi-
ences as women working in coops.

There are lots of women doing lots of hard
work in the coops. There are lots who used
to work in coops. And there are women who
have intentionally stayed away from coop
involvement. From what I know, even though
many women want to work cooperatively, the
coops are still traditionally sexist and may
keep many women away. I find this showing
up especially in the way people at our coop
talk to each other at meetings.

Although there is a lot more that I could
say, as a feminist, about my own coop exper-
iences, I would rather not write about it by
myself. I would like to talk more to other
women and then write collectively. It would
be exciting if through the conference we
could get together a group of women from
every coop to analyze sexism in coops and
what we can do about it. Maybe we could
then write a thing for "Gold Flower."

For information about places and times call
any of the coops listed in this issue. The
conference is open to anyone and gay care
is provided.

Men Star in

Women’s

Only six men and many more women came to
the performance of “Lysistrata" which I saw
at Dudley Riggs' Experimental Theater Co.
on Washington Ave. A pity for both sexes.
More men should have come to enjoy the fami-
liar male buffoonery which clutters our mo-
dern stage. The women should have skipped
this chance to see a mythical heroine in
action, and rather stayed home that evening
to watch a very real Billie Jean King dis-
patch another Riggs.

For those few readers who are curious
about what "Lysistrata" is like as a man's
play, I'll recite the transformation. The
men are introduced as crippled, yet still
operative wind-up soldiers in an extended
scene which opens this adaptation. (In
Aristophanes' "Lysistrata," the opening
scene belongs to the women.) When the women
are finally brought on in this misbegotten
production, Lysistrata talks like a carni-
val barker, a female Professor Harold Hill.
The rest of the women are twittering cheer-
leaders. Remember, I recite; I don't ex-
plain.

The women agree to deprive the men of
the sexual access until the men settle on
a peaceful compromise. Lysistrata incites
her unlikely troops to storm the Acropolis.
They throw the men out and the separation
begins.

The rest of the performance concentrates
on the men's sexual agonies as they attempt
to wrest their women from the seat of power
and hustle them back to hearth and home.

A sausage-shaped pink balloon is used as a
battering ram and returns limp from the
fray. The men clutch their crotches, wail
out their desires, and beg for a normal life
in which women and war are compatible plea-
sures.

This clowning was intermittently funny,
but these laughs should not have belonged to
the men. It is the women who recognize
their husbands and protectors as comedians.
The comedy is sharpest when the women dis-
parage their men's military pretensions.

Library Positions

The American Library Asso-
ciation/Social Responsibili-
ties Round Table/Task Force
on Women maintains a roster
of women interested in admin-
istrative management and
specialist positions in lib-
raries.

Women who desire to
be placed on the roster fill
out a standard form, which
includes such basic resume
information as educational
and employment background,
type of library and responsi-
bilities preferred, geograph-
ic restrictions. On the
basis of this information,
profile forms are screened and
matched to incoming employer
requests for resumes.

The goal of the women's
roster is to increase the
opportunities for women in
librarianship at a time when
fewer women are being chosen
for high level positions than
was the case twenty years
ago. Currently, 73 women are
listed on the roster and over
100 library employers have re-
quested resumes either for
general affirmative action
use or for specific job open-
ings. The roster has been in
operation since spring, 1972.

A Review

Referring to Rogers' translation of the
Greek comedy, I find the lines:

LYSISTRATA. Now in the market you see them
like Corybants, jangling about with
their armor of mail.

Fiercely they stalk in the midst of the
crockery, sternly parade by the cabbage
and kale...

STRATYLLIS. Lately I witnessed a captain
of cavalry, proudly the while on his
charger he sat,

Witnessed him, soldierly, buying an omelet
stowing it all in his cavalry hat...

Off runs a shop-girl, appalled at the
sight of him, down he sits soldierly,
gobbles her fruit.

The women in the Experimental Theater Co.
production have no lines like that. They
are continually and deliberately upstaged
by the men. Lysistrata is nearly a minor
character. I can only suppose that the
director, James Monitor, slanted the pro-
duction toward the only kind of humor and
heroics he understands. "Lysistrata" is
simply not his play, and once he got his
hands on it, it could not be ours either.

By the play's end, the antiwar humor has
been drowned out by a deluge of sexuality.
The men are "hot" and a painted sun glowers
down on them. What do they do on this
sweltering day? They eat donuts -- linger-
ingly, lovingly. No doubt every hole is
supposed to be a vagina, but as I watched
one soldier shove his staff through this
tight little pastry, the resemblance to an
asshole was unmistakable. Monitor's over-
zealous attempts to emphasize a heterosex-
ual tension sometimes take strange turns.

"Lysistrata" ends, of course, with peace
and a nominal victory for the women. But
it's the men, always the men, who are
smiling.

Feminist Poets to Read in October

The Women Poets of the Twin Cities, a  
loose confederation of local poets which  
sponsors readings of women's work and  
poetry workshop sessions, will host two  
readings this fall. One, to be held in  
mid-October, will feature poets Jenne  
Andrews, Patricia Hampl, and Carolyn Vo-  
gel. At the other, local women will read  
poetry concerning women's fears of, and  
reactions to, the crime of rape; the  
reading is a benefit for a member of the  
organization who was attacked and beaten  
this summer. Dates and places of the  
readings have not yet been announced.

Jenne Andrews, whose book "In Pursuit  
of the Family" will be published soon,  
grew up in New Mexico and studied  
creative writing at Colorado State. Dur-  

ing her two years in Minnesota, her work  
has been published in Ms. and many poetry  
magazines.

Carolyn Vogel of Red Wing majored in  
writing at Vassar, then turned to teach-  
ing high school English and speech. Until  
moving to Minneapolis last year, Vogel  
was an investigative reporter and women's  
editor for the Red Wing newspaper.

Patricia Hampl edits the KSJN publica-  
tion "Preview" and co-edits the poetry  
magazine "The Lamp in the Spine." A St.  
Paul native, she studied creative writing  
in Iowa and is currently at work on a  
series of essays on women writers and an  
article on Minnesota feminist Meridel  
LeSueur.

I would crawl in your wet flesh and sleep.

Dainty June Only Peeks  
Through Wings of “Fly”  

by Mary Hastings  

Deeply-felt farewells are always eloquent to  

Lee Allen as Bunty Brads essays an energetic,  
the lover and the beloved.  

if drunken, roller skate dance.  

However, outsiders rarely can perceive the  
private beauty of these leavetakings and of-  
ten grow restive, embarrassed and, sadly,  
bored.  

After the "Montage," however, the play loses  
its vitality. Ms. Havoc's characters suffer  
human weaknesses and are victims of cosmic  
cruelties. But the author does not engage  
the audience's sympathies.  

Such is the case with June Havoc's farewell  
to vaudeville, "I, Said the Fly," which had  
its world premiere September 20 at the Guth-  
rie Theater.  

Alma Marvel is pregnant and can't stop  
taking dangerous pratfalls because her hus-  
band/partner can't carry their act alone.  

The play, subtitled "A Souvenir," consti-  
tutes Ms. Havoc's remembrance of her life  

in vaudeville, which began when she was two-  
year-old "Baby June" and continued through  
her incarnation as "Miss Dainty June, the  
tiniest toe dancer in the world."  

Fanny Brad agonizes over Bunty's increasing  
dependence on the bottle.  

But I could perceive these dilemmas only at  
one remove--as though the author had anes-  
thetized her characters' pain.  

Vaudevillians and Geeks  

In "I, Said the Fly," Ms. Havoc presents the  
plight of a company of shopworn vaudevill-  

ians--Fanny and Bunty Brads, Big Gurn, Harry  
and Alma Marvel "And Company."  

Only Kenneth Welsh reached me in his por-  
trayal of Big Gurn, a second-rate performer  
who sadistically brutalizes "And Company,"  
the untalented young woman who assists him  
with the rats and guinea pigs who co-star  
with Big Gurn.  

The group is stranded in a mid-western tank  
town, struggling to avoid the fate of "geek  
acts" (performances in which animals are tor-  
tured and killed for the audience's edifica-  
tion).  

Welsh is repellant and convincing when he  
taunts "And Company" with her inability to  
commit suicide.  

Moths and Acrobats  

The group receives notifications from their  
agents that booking offices are closing:  
vaudeville is dead.  

The author mixes the dreamy, rather abstract  
quality of the "Montage" with the melo-  
dramatic "realism" of the second act.  

The finest moments in the production come at  
the beginning. A "Montage" of vaudevillians  
parades before the audience before the story  
begins.  

From time to time, silent tumblers and  
acrobats appear and mime a routine while  
the play's action goes forward. These  
attempts at surreal symbolism fail, as does  
the introduction of a moth-like figure in  
pink gauze who wafts across the stage dur-  
ing scene changes.  

Meet the Family  

The audience meets Bunty Brads and Family  
(Ms. Havoc plays Fanny Brads). In this re-  
creation of an old vaudeville routine, Ms.  
Havoc gives the audience the most fulfilling  
moments of the evening. Although she is  
well into middle age, she retains an econom-  
ical dancer's body and the confidence that  
must come from performing since infancy.  

Although "I, Said the Fly" is only as good  
as the "Montage" which opens it, the appear-  
ance of June Havoc is impressive.  

Seeing this talented, widely experienced  
woman was justification for my evening. I  
hope her next play is worthy of her.  

The "Montage" has a cinematic, "Felliniesque"  
quality. And, Barbara Byrne intensifies  

this mood as Alma Marvel, a sweet clown in  
baggy pants--very reminiscent of Giulietta  
Massini.  

Performances of "I, Said the Fly" continue  
with matinees and evening performances  
through September, October and November.

First, You Put the Key in the Ignition

by KATE LIGARE

"I mean, do you know any-
thing about your car?
Beyond how to start it?"

--St. Paul administrator
to "Gold Flower" reporter

KKK KKK KK kkk

The fall I turned sixteen, my
father took me out to the gar
age and made me change a tire
on the family station wagon.
If I was going to drive, I had
to be able to take care of
the simple emergencies. The
fall I turned 22, I bought my
first car and my father and

I spent another session in
the garage reviewing jumper
cables, carburetors, spark
plugs, and heater hoses.
Which was not much in terms
of the infinite number of
things that can go wrong with
a car, but it was more than
most men and women know about
the vehicle they depend upon
so heavily.

Peculiarities

It always seemed peculiar to
me that in a school system
which taught me how to brush
my teeth, use a compound mi-
croscope, and shoot a bow
and arrow I was never taught
how to do something as sim-
ple and essential as change a
tire on a car. But then,
neither was my brother. Auto
repair and maintenance essen-
tially remains a mystery to
us both.

Male Fantasies

That's why most Auto Mechan-
ics classes in the Twin

Cities area assume at the be-
ginning that students don't
know anything about cars "and
most of them don't." And,
according to South Community
School Director Gary Soule,
automobile classes designed
specifically for women oper-
ate on an assumption that is
totally erroneous. "The idea
that boys start in Auto Mech-
anics with more background
than girls is just not true
as far as we're concerned."
Apparently, men just bring

in a few more pet fantasies;
fantasies which are quickly
dispelled once work on cars
really begins.

Courses in the Twin Cities
to help people better under-
stand their automobiles range
from elementary classroom in-
troductions to full scale
work on a variety of engines
and specialized problems.
Offered at a reasonable cost
in well-equipped facilities,
such night courses are popu-

lar among both sexes and
appear well-organized and re-
sponsibly taught.

The interest and ability of
women to work on cars is
accepted, respected, and
highly encouraged at most
community schools. Although
some schools like South teach
all coeducational courses,
other schools offer a few
courses exclusively for wo-
men to encourage them to en-
roll. And although no wo-
man has ever been used as an
instructor, Stan Baraga, Dir-
ector of the Minneapolis Adult
Education Program, states
emphatically that "if we had
a good female mechanic, we'd
use her for sure."

Top People

In general, "women are sur-
prised by what they can end
up doing," reports David
Barkmeier, Auto Maintenance
Instructor at South High.
According to Barkmeier, women
tend to take the course more
seriously and are therefore
more meticulous and successful
in their work.

"Three women were my top
people in last year's Auto
Maintenance class. Between
them, they tuned up eight
cars—they brought in the
cars of neighbors, friends,
everybody."

Fun Tune-Ups

Barkmeier tries to not only
teach the basics of Auto
Maintenance in his course, but
give students a feeling for
reasonable repair charges and
suggestions for cutting costs.

Nancy Moody, one of Bark-
meier's star pupils, was also
glowing in her description of
the course.

"My girlfriend and I de-
cided to take the course be-
cause it was so expensive to
have the car fixed all the
time. My husband did a lot
of our car work and had some
of the tools, but I was tired
of just helping him. I wanted
to get beyond just tagging a-
long."

"It was really fun. We got
into doing tune-ups, install-
ing new shock absorbers, and
packing wheel bearings. I
learned some things that my
husband didn't know and we got
good advice on tools and eq-
uipment to invest in."

"There were 15 people in the
course and maybe half were
women. Some girls tended to
play down their ability and

Auto Mechanic, cont.

ask guys for help; other wo-
men wanted to do it on their
own and resented help. On
the whole, though, women
seemed more patient and thor-
ough!

"I guess the best thing I got
from the course was the confi-
dence that if something went
wrong with my car, I was not
at the mercy of someone else.
Even if I don't want to do
the work myself, I know what
is involved and what to ex-
pect from a garage."

Instructor Barkmeier echoes
Nancy Moody's thoughts. "Most
of the women we get really
want to learn how to do it
themselves. They don't want
to rely on husbands or boy-
friends and they don't want
to be taken in by filling
stations and ripped off every
time they have to take their
cars into a garage."

95% Curious

Girls are also enrolling in
high school Auto Mechanics
courses during the day. As I
talked with Barkmeier and a-
nother instructor at South
High, three girls in the back-
ground were taking a test on
ignition systems, along with
fifteen high school boys.

"I suppose 95% of the girls I
get here during the day are
just curious," stated Bark-
meier. "They think it's a fun
class to take. But at the
end of the course, I'll make

recommendations to anyone who
I think has the capability to
become a good mechanic." So
far, he hasn't run across a
woman with such aspirations,
but he feels there have been
a few who had the ability.

Options, Options

Another option open to Twin
Cities residents who wish to
work on their own cars are
do-it-yourself garages.
Community Garage, 344 East 19th
St. (335-0663) is a
loose club-school organization
of about 150 people, almost
50% of whom are women. For
$10 a year, members are free
to use garage space and equip-
ment and enlist the services
of their personal mechanic.
Do-It-Yourself Auto-Repair at
701 West Excelsior Blvd. also
offers garage space and tools
on an hourly rental basis. A
mechanic consultant is avail-
able, as well as the service
of analyzing a potential used
car for a buyer.

Despite the fact that I still
wouldn't know what to do if
smoke started billowing out of
my engine on Highway 94 during
rush hour, it is comforting
to know that in terms of opp-
ortunities, Twin Cities real-
ity is far more encouraging
than the myth.

For the past few years the store has

energy from a loose and changing col-

to reestablish Amazon Bookstore in a

store would be open longer hours and

A Funeral

It was the first funeral I had ever been
to in my life. People I have known have
died before, but no one this close, and so
I took a day off work to go to her funeral
and to try and work into my system the fact
of her death. She was only 33. The thing
about death is, you can't take it piece by
piece and absorb it gradually. It has to

be swallowed whole. I have never seen a
dead person before either, so the shock of
the open casket was hard for me. I hadn't

really cried about her death yet, but when
the man in a grey suit carefully closed the
lid over her face, I did cry... And as I
looked around I saw many old friends, men
and women, crying. The whole service was
full of moments like the closing of the cas-
ket -- triggering off sobs or muffled weep-
ing. The principal of my old school spoke
for the majority of the time, and he calmly
recalled events, characteristics, jokes
about her life in the school and in the
world. And there were moments during the
service when we laughed, too. Maybe this
was one of the finest tributes to Barbara --
we couldn't think about her without smiles
because she brought so much humor into our
lives.

When I think back on the funeral and the
hours I spent afterwards in the Junior High
where I had taught the year before, I am
struck by a new warmth and tenderness in the
experience which never existed so strongly
and openly before with those same people.
And when I narrow it down even further; I
think it had to do with the fact that men
cried openly, touched more and expressed

all ranges of emotion without self-conscious-
ness. Funerals and deaths appear to be the
only times men are given the freedom to cry
like this, to sob openly, to put their arms
around one another, or women, without feel-

ing uncomfortable.

When I went into the school, I also felt
a new kind of communication. Something en-
tirely new had happened to everyone there.
The same guys who often sat in the lounge
with sour expressions were softened and
open and hungering for talk, for descrip-
tions of how I felt when I heard the news,
for memories of times with Barb. And men
who had always been sensitive were concern-
ed about my present situation of loneliness,
in a job where I went through the day feel-
ing numb and sad, and no one else was exper-

iencing this with me. I found myself able
to tell my principal about a time when Barb-
ara had cried in the teachers' lounge. I

had never been able to talk of those things
with him before. I recalled Barb and my-
self sharing a similar astonishment at the
luck we had in marrying the men we did, and
the principal understood.

I walked out of the school sensing that
something very fine had been let loose in
everyone there. And I guess, the sight of
the tear-streaked faces of the men stays
with me most vividly. At the time there
were no behaviors assigned to men and women.
We held each other that day. We often
touched and we talked a lot. I hope it
does not take a funeral or a death to bring
about this kind of openness and freedom, but
that men and women can experience it simply
because it is the richest and fullest way
to learn about ourselves.

The next "Gold Flower" meeting will be
