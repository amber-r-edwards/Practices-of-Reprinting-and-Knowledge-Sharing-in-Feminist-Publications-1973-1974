Dear sisters at Gold Flower;

Although I found your last issue gener-
ally quite good and was especially pleased
to see the gay women's groups in your cal-
endar, I felt that the article on Gloria
Steinem paid insufficient attention to one
specific problem lesbians are faced with con-
sistently—that of being ignored or slighted
by predominantly straight women's groups.
Steinem is highly praised despite the fact
that she “touched on every feminist issue
except abortion and gayness." As it is
stated that she made some remarks on abor-
tion later in the day, it seems the only
issue she neglected was gayness. To me and
my thousands of gay sisters in the area, this
is no slight omission, but a major weakness
in her presented views. Steinem and many
other straight feminists have really got
their heads together on many things, but
until they start including gay women in their
thinking, they will remain seriously lacking.
We are tired of being ignored—men generally
try to pretend lesbians don't exist and it's
a double blow when we receive the same treat-
ment from our straight sisters.

~|Where We’re At In

BY ADDIE MATTSON

In a sector of our society
that prides itself on pro-
gress and leadership, we all
as women, from the filing
clerk to the tokenism of the
boardroom, are confronted
with a deeply entrenched
mythology....A doctrine that
says that the woman in busi-
ness is a "girl", relegated
to the unsatisfying, dead-
end jobs - all the boring
stuff that no man would do
at any price; and then they
under-pay us into the "bar-
gain".

One by one we must destroy
the old, hard-line "facts"
of the business world and
lay them out for the dead
myths they are. We cannot
again be party to these
fallacies.

The first "fact" we face is
that "it's a waste of money
to train women for increased
responsibilities because they
will quit and have babies
when they marry anyway." More
and more women are not marry-
ing at all (this is now true
of 10% of all American women).
In the event they do marry,
women are having few chil-
dren, spaced closer together,
and are returning to the
labor force for 30 - 35 years.
In that time, a company will
profit many times over from
money spent training a
woman. At the very worst,
the return on investment
will be postponed a few
years.

Absentee Rates

Then, they tell us it costs
more to employ women because
their rate of absenteeism is
higher. This is false.
Women do have more frequent
absenteeism, a day or two

at a time -- but it's men
who are struck by major
surgeries and sicknesses
that cause long periods of
absence from work, and large
claims to group insurance
carriers as well.

Labor Department statistics

tell us that, overall, women
miss an average of 5.3 days

per year, while men miss 5.4
days per year. The figures

are very close, but they are
also in our favor.

These statistics do not even
reflect the fact that most
women work in repetitive
jobs that take their toll in
days missed from sheer bore-
dom. There are very few
women working in challenging
high-level jobs that have a
far smaller rate of absen-
teeism.

Known as the "Pin Money
Fallacy", one of the most
evil myths of all is the one
that says - women only work
for "pin money" or "to help
out", and that to promote a

woman over a man, or to
equalize her pay, isn't
right because a man has a
family to support.

This is the cruelest hoax of
all - more and more families
are headed by women. Nearly
50% of the women who work
today are those who are
heads of their families, whe-
ther through death, divorce,
separation, or those who are
single, or whose husbands
are disabled. One-third of
the families headed by these
under-paid women live in ac-
tual poverty with median in-
come ranging from $4000 to
$5600. This is substanti-
ally and shamefully below
the $8200 median income for
a family with only the male

partner employed!

Further, how can it be in
the best interest of a pro-
fit-making enterprise to de-
cide compensation and ad-
vancement on the basis of
family status rather than
individual merit?

Promotion Doubts

Very closely related to the
"Pin Money Theory" is the
one that says that promoting
a woman doesn't work because
men don't like to work for
women. This is purely and
simply a crock of rot --
most men have never worked
for a woman and have no ex-
perience on which to base
their prejudice. In fact,
the Labor Department says
that in cases where men have
worked under a woman super-
visor, better than 70% are
willing to work for other
women. But then, who needs
a fact when a good, old,
time-worn preconception will
do?

However, it is in this area
that the business world must
come face to face with a
cold hard fact of life. In
five years there will be one
million less men in the op-

timum managerial age group
(35 - 45 years) than now, at
the same time the demand for
managerial skills will be at
a historic peak. It is of
course deplorable that an
actual demand for women in
decision-making positions is
so contingent on the male
population, but women must
find ways to prepare them-
selves now to step into po-
sitions of real power in the
business world. It would
seem that we will be at last
having time and numbers on
our side.

At this point we confront

a myth perpetrated as much
by women as by men - the
idea that a woman must
either be a "femme fatale" or
a battle-axe" to achieve
success in business. Women
who make it to the top in

Business

the business world have had
to succeed against all of
these ingrained prejudices
in addition to mastering the
technical aspects of her job.
Too, a woman will have more
likely than not made the
grade without the invaluable
personal counseling that one
man will offer to a younger
man in the organization.

She will probably have not
had the advantage of a feel-
ing of support and encour-
agement from her own female
co-workers either. As yet,
we women have not learned to
be supportive of each
other's success. We are
still hung-up on the compe-
tition for a man's favors -
and this is as true in the
office as it is at a cock-
tail party.

Moving In, But Not Up

“Women are moving in, but
not up". This is a fact.
While more and more women
are entering the business
world (we now compose 38% of
the total labor force), the
wages/salaries paid women in
business have declined. "The
median wage in 1970 for wo-
men was 59.4% of the median
wage for men -- a decrease
from nearly 64% in 1955."
(Labor Department statistic)

We are still by and large
the same secretaries and
clerks we were when women
first started entering the
business world in meaningful
numbers in the early part of
this century.

Not only are women mostly
involved with low-paying,
tedious jobs, but in cases
where women have managerial
level jobs, we are usually
paid less than men doing
identical or closely related
work.

Only 5% of top managerial
positions are held by women
and only 7% of them earn
salaries in excess of
$10,000. Not only that - a
woman in a managerial posi-
tion will in most cases be
more highly qualified -
academic rating, post-gradu-
ate training, self-disci-
plined, and harder working -
than her male co-worker -
because she has to be or she
wouldn't be hired to be paid
less than that male co-worker
in the first place.

And, that is where we're at
now. Most of us are still
clerical workers, still paid
less than men, still being
passed over for promotions,
still "the girls at the
office”.

Statistical data taken from
November, 1972 Staff Recom-
mendations, Research Insti-
tute of America.

I was asked to write a col  
umn about Christmas, on the  
assumption that it is a holi-  
day of the "matriarchal  
witch cult" which has been  
"stolen" by men. It is not  
true that Christmas was a  
witch cult holiday, nor did  
they celebrate the winter  
solstice. Christmas has far  
more significance to women  
than that, and though the re  
quest caught me rather un-  
prepared, I'd like to write  
about the significance  
Christmas has for me. These  
ideas are based on mythology,  
and so are rather incomplete  
and subject to some modifi-  
cation as more information  
becomes available.  

Christmas is essentially  
celebrating the birth of a  
divine child, a recurrent  
motif in ancient mythology,  
but not apparently a feature  
of the witch cult. Informa-  
tion about Stone Age (ca  
50,000 BC for the period con-  
sidered here) religious  
practices comes from two  
sources—meager archeological  
finds, and the traditions  
preserved in the witch cult  
(Margaret Murray, The Witch  
Cult in Western Europe). No  

by the Madonna and child.  

In Crete, where female-  
oriented society probably  
lasted to about 1500 BC,  
there was preserved the leg-  
end of the mother goddess  
Rhea and the birth of her  
divine child, the Cretan  
Zeus. Rhea bore him in a  
cave, surrounded by female  
and male votaries. The fe-  
male votaries were semi-  
divine nymphs who assisted  
at the birth and became the  
child's nurses. The male  
votaries were the Telchines,  
the smiths who used the  
cave, and the Kuretes,  
youths from nearby towns.  
The Cretan Zeus never over-  
shadowed his mother. “The  
Greeks later gave Rhea to  
the male god Kronos as wife,  
but on analogy with other  
divine mothers, the birth  
was parthenogenic. The  
birth of Kore (a female) to  
Demeter, and of Hephaistos  
(the smith-god) to Hera are  
other examples of the birth  
of divine children to mother  
goddesses. (Mythological in-  
formation is based on a good  
deal of reading, and largely  
on H. J. Rose, A Handbook of  
Greek Mythology.  

doubt the witch cult had  
added to its original dogma  
through the centuries. For-  
tunately, in some aspects  
archeology and witch-cult  
records agree. The Paleo-  
lithic practitioners of the  
witch cult buried their  
dead with grave goods, in-  
dicating a belief in an  
afterlife; they believed in  
a dual-sexed divinity which  
could become present in a  
person or animal, and which  
might have been killed and  
eaten as "holy communion."  
The medieval records do not  
discuss a mother goddess or  
a divine child, though the  
female face of the dual  
divinity was worshipped.  
Archeology reveals the Stone  
Age Venuses, statues of very  
pregnant females. These  
were associated with fertili-  
ty.  

And The Male God Disappears  

It is possible that the  
witch cult originally con-  
tained the concept of a  
mother-goddess who gave  
birth to all living things,  
nourished them, and took  
them back to her in death.  
However, it appears that  
this concept came to great  
prominence in the early agri-  
cultural communities. At  
Catal Huyuk (James Mellaart,  
Earliest Civilizations of  
the Near East) the male god  
virtually disappears. It is  
also at Catal Huyuk (ca  
7000 BC) that the goddess is  
shown delivering and nursing  
a child. These mother and  
child figures were continual-  
ly popular around the Medi-  
terranean, and were replaced  

By Her Own Power  

The stable at Bethlehem  
was a cave. When Mary had  
given birth, the shepherds,  
who also used the cave, came  
to see. Angels, in some  
legends, also assisted at  
the birth. Mary gave birth  
parthenogenically. Feminists  
sometimes speak disparaging-  
ly of the "Virgin" Mary, and  
some Biblical scholars would  
have the word mean "young  
girl." Yet the virginity of  
Mary is an important symbol.  
The mother goddess brought  
forth children by her own  
divine power. When the  
power of the Greek patriarchs  
had increased to the extent  
that they gave Hera, the  
Argive mother goddess, to  
Zeus and made him the father  
of most of her children,  
they were forced to concede  
that she renewed her virgin-  
ity by bathing in a magic  
spring. The mother goddess,  
originally, was never domin-  
ated by men. Mary, too, was  
in a unique position vis a  
vis male domination. In the  
patriarchal Jewish-Roman-  
Greek society in which she  
lived, women were controlled  
by the father while they  
lived with him, and by the  
husband when they were mar-  
ried. Mary was not living  
at home, but travelling to  
Bethlehem with Joseph. Nor  
was she married. She and  
Joseph were betrothed—some-  
thing more formal than an  
engagement, but apparently  
not containing any contract-  
ual vows of obedience.  
Comparing Mary with the  
mother goddess should not  

A Christmas  

disparage Christianity.  
Rather, it should be enrich-  
ing to see that Christianity  
contains the best features  

of an older belief. If one  
believes that Christ's birth  
was arranged by God, is it  
not significant that God ar-  
ranged these parallels with  

a female-oriented religion?  
Is it not reasonable that  

God should reveal herself/  
himself to a female-oriented  
society as a mother, and that  
the birth of the divine child  
should be an important fea-  
ture of this revelation?  

Nor am I saying that Mary is  
a goddess. Her humanity is  
important in Christian trad-  
ition, for she represents  
the perfection we shall all  
attain. Never in ancient  
mythology did a human mother  
bear a fully divine child.  
This emphasis on humans do-  
ing divine work is integral-  
ly Christian.  

At any rate, whether we  
are Christian or not, we can  
see in Christmas a celebra-  
tion of birth. Of course,  
our biology has been deter-  
mining our destiny far too  
long. But Mary became preg-  
nant by her own choice, and  
delivered her child free of  
male domination. Whatever  
else we might want to do, it  
seems to me that feminists  
must begin to emphasize that  
the things women do, and  
have done for millennia, are  
vital, worthy of respect,  
sacred. In our patriarchal  
societies, the most idiotic  
things men do, like fight  
wars, are important, respect-  
able, even sacred, because  
men do them. The things wo-  
men do are unimportant, ridi-  
culous, obscene, because wo-  
men do them. Feminist inter-  
pretations of Christmas  
might emphasize the import-  
ance of birth as a symbol  
for all traditional "women's  
work.”  

The second facet of Christ-  
mas symbology is also relat-  

Meditation  

ed to the mother goddess.  
The story of the dying vege-  
tation god who is also the  
sacred king, dying for the  
people, apparently developed  
in the early days of patri-  
archy. The earliest known  
dying god is Sumerian Dumuzi  
who was cast into hell by  
his wife Inanna when he fail-  
ed to fall down and worship  
her. This is obviously pre-  
patriarchal, but Dumuzi is  
not a vegetation god. The  
more patriarchal Semites  
picked up the motif of the  
dead god and applied it to  
the seasonal death of vege-  
tation (they pronounced his  
name Tammuz). The death of  
Tammuz and his fellows—  
Attis, Osiris, etc.—are  
said to reflect the habit of  
king-killing to ensure fer-  
tility. This was probably  
not a pre-patriarchal habit.  
Yet from it comes the idea  
that the divine child is the  
savior-king who will die for  
the people.  

Not Son, But Lover  

In the Egyptian legend of  
Isis and Horus, the divine  
child saves the people from  
the drought god, Set. The  
divine child Horus does not  
himself die for the people,  
but his "father" Osiris did.  
Phrygian Attis, divine child  
of the mother goddess  
Kybele, does die. Adonis,  
another dying god, is not  
the son but the lover of the  
great mother. Evidently, in  
patriarchal times, the  
legend of the king who dies  
to save the people was  
grafted onto the legend of  
the divine child. This  
prefigures the Christmas  
story, as the baby Jesus is  
the savior and king who will  
die for the people. The  
earlier dying savior-kings  
were never "quite" divine in  
legend and cult. They seem  
to have been people who were  
"taken over" by a god.  
Christ is considered as God  
incarnate.  

The actual date of Christ-  
mas was taken from the pa-  
triarchal Druidic feast of  
the winter solstice, when  
the sacred mistletoe was cut  
from the oak (symbol of the  
supreme god, not goddess),  
and human sacrifices were  
offered to ensure the return  
of the sun. The Druidic  
religion also embodies the  
tradition of king-killing,  
which we have seen as a pa-  
triarchal addition to the  
myths about the mother god-  
dess. It seems unfortunate  
that this date was chosen,  
and that such customs as the  
Yule log and mistletoe were  
adapted from the patriarchal  
feast.  

I don't know to what trad-  
ition Christmas gift-giving  
might be ascribed, though  
it seems likely that a  

divine child would be given  
gifts. The Telchines are  
said to have given the Cre-  
tan child things to play  
with. I like to reflect on  
the countless women who  
sacrificed time and energy  
to make Christmas gifts and  
bake Christmas goodies. I  
would not like to say such  
efforts were foolish. Fe-  
male artists have worked  
with thread and yarn and  
dough for millennia. They  
have been ignored and derid-  
ed for millennia. Will we,  
feminists, also deride their  
work? Cooking is something  
women do every day, but male  
chefs do as a creative pro-  
fession. Yet the tradition-  
al Christmas recipes were  
each invented by some woman  
acting creatively in one way  
that was open to her. So  
too with needlework. The  
male who changes skirt  
lengths is a creative pro-  
fessional; the woman who in-  
vents a new design for a  
quilt or a sweater is just  

a housewife.  

Now that we look forward  
to new ways of acting out  
our creativity and our love  
for others, I look back at  
Christmastime to the valiant  
women who kept alive the  
fragile coals of independ-  
ence. Much of our heritage  
has been lost. We shall  
never recreate the old fe-  
male-oriented religion.  

BY HELEN VICTRY  

But, perhaps because women  
surrounded the feast with good  
food and presents and merri-  
ment, the Christmas cele-  
bration preserves for us the  
mother and the divine child,  
a deliberate link with that  
older religion. Perhaps  
from such links we can in-  
fuse the religions of our  
culture with reality, fem-  
inist reality.  

There is a lot to change  
in Christmas. From artful  
handcrafts and creative  
baking, we have unfettered  
materialism. From the cele-  
bration of birth and the im-  
portance of women, we have  
office Christmas parties.  
Some say the whole affair  
should be junked. I would  
rather fight to keep Christ-  
mas as our ancestresses kept  
it. We must not only create  
our own holidays, we must  
renew what was ours. We who  
are creating a new world  
ought to remember at Christ-  
mas those who have gone be-  
fore: those who lived in a  
female-oriented society who  
made the legend of the  
divine birth; those who  
lived in a male-dominated  
society who kept alive this  
reminder that women and what  
they do are important and  
worthy of respect; those who  
used Christmas as a focus  
for creativity and intelli-  
gence when all other  
channels were denied them.

LESBIAN CENTER OPENS

Gay women in the Twin Cities area will be  
opening a Lesbian Resource Center in Minnea-  
polis this month to better serve the speci-  
fic needs of lesbians here. We have found  
that Gay House, due to its male orientation,  
and existing women's groups, due to their  
straight orientation, have given us secon-  
dary, if any, consideration. This has re-  
sulted in having to fight a sense of invisi-  
bility for years. We are now coming out  
completely, affirming that we are here and  
that we can no longer be ignored.

The center will serve several purposes,  
with the goal of building a lesbian communi-  
ty in the area. A small but exclusive li-  
brary exists which will eventually contain  
all periodicals and books concerning les-  
bians. There will be a lounge to allow wo-  
men to drop in, look at the literature and  
meet other women. One important function  
will be that of acting as a clearinghouse  
and facilitator for any groups, activities  
or actions which women want to do - provi-  
ding a place to meet and find other women  
who are also interested. We will also be in  
contact with other gay women's organizations  
across the country to provide an exchange of  
ideas and support.

The storefront we have found is at 710 W.  
22nd St. (just west of Lyndale), but it will  
not be vacant until December 18. At that  
time we will be moving in, painting and  
shelf building. Soon after that we will be  
in full operation. Gay women in the area  
who have ideas, want to see what is happen-  
ing or just want to drop in should come by  
then. For a start our hours will be 12-9,  
Tuesday thru Saturday. And keep looking in  
Gold Flower for further specific information,  
including our phone number.

communicate the special problems and needs  
of these sisters whose existence is doubly  
oppressed - that of being a Lesbian and a  
mother. I can state some realities which  
these women face, but the frustrations,  
struggles, and experiences they must cope  
with daily can only be expressed by them-  
selves.

Some realities: The courts which too often  
rip off their children because these women  
love women; the mental health profession  
with the "expertise" to label Lesbians as  
"unfit mothers", again because we are  
committed to and love women; the suffering  
the children of gays receive at the hands  
of the straight world; the pressures to con-  
ceal one's identity from friends, family,  
employers, and children; the rejection from  
other Lesbians without children; the myth  
of motherhood which only perpetuates the  
sacrificial rite of leading a double or even  
triple life; economic survival in a society  
which discriminates against single women/mothers and  
twice over those who love another of the  
same sex; the isolation and lack of models  
for those who reject the hetero-nuclear  
family; and the anguish, fears, guilt, and  
pressures which these women share.

Because of these conditions, a need has been  
expressed by Lesbians with children to get  
together, discuss problems, and lend one  
another support. The group's direction is  
its own--whether political, social, sup-  
portive, or any combination, it will be a  
beginning.

Depending on numbers, two groups are  
forming--Mondays at 4 p.m. and Tuesdays at  
7 p.m. Groups start the second week of  
January and, of course, children are more  
than welcome.

Dear Les,

As for me, becoming Gay  
has been a recent, agonizing  
tho beautiful process; a  
gradual, explorative, per-  
sonal struggle to effective-  
ly express yet accept my-  

self. To somehow come to  
terms with and survive the  
radical shifts in feeling  
and the meaning of my fami-  
ly, friends, job change, and  
sexual responses. In short  
a total shift of life-style  
and self-definition. There  
do not seem to be any "instant  
Gays." The shift--if  
it takes place--may be said  
to progress slowly thru  
three stages each shading  
into the other two. *

1. Being open  

2. Being able  

3. Being committed  

I would like to add a fourth  
experience but am a bit  
unsure at this time--it re-  
minds me somewhat of the old  
saying about whistling in  
the graveyard. So OK, HERE  

GOES.  
4. Is that all there is?  
etc. HO-Hum.  

D. W. Cory once wrote "No  
teacher but life itself  
could have convinced me that  
homosexual passions do not  
come and go at will, but  
cling relentlessly to the  
last breath of life. When  

I awaken today and feel de-  
void of the drive that has  

dominated my personality, I  
smile and merely await its  
inevitable return."  

Now who am I? I am a mid-  
dle aged Lesbian, sober  
Alcoholic, Mother--a contri-  
buting, productive member of  
society and one of God's  
children regardless of my  
sexual preference.  

Heedless of any other ethic-  
al verdict I do not accept  
the label of Queer or per-  
vert as applying to me or us  
=<=“if you will,  

With consideration and  
truth we have struggled thru  
the crisis of self-accept-  
ance to relearn our Moral  
A B C's in a fashion more  
painful than any Straight  
ever thought of. We have  
also learned the hard way  
that self-hatred is merely  
the refracted result of  
society's rejection. There  
may be many cautious Gays  
around but there are darned  
few cowardly Gays because  
honesty and courage are the  
natural byproducts of all  
who survive this shift.

‘Vaginal Politics’ Rejects  
Blood, Birth, and Death  

by Mary Hastings  

Woman is victim. And no institution  
has tested the culturally approved martyrdom  
of women more than the American health care  
system.  

In Vaginal Politics (Quadrangle Books,  
Inc.: $6.95), Ellen Frankfort explores the  
daily horrors of women's victimization by  
the medical establishment as well as its all  
encompassing oppression of poor, black and  
female.  

Frankfort delineates this area in which  
women are uniquely suited to effect a change  
in our society. For in health care nothing  
less than a revolution will do.  

She offers the example of the Los Angel-  
es Self-Help Center as one alternative to  
the existing health care quagmire.  

The Self-Help Center can be regarded as  
an "extreme" reaction to the mortifying  
experience that all women endure at the  
hands of the OB-Gyn specialist:  

Frankfort saw women reacting radically  
to the often dirty, embarrassing ritual of  
being draped and "guarded" by a harried  
nurse when "...Carol, a woman from the Los  
Angeles Self-Help Clinic slipped off her  
dungarees and underpants, borrowed somebody's  
coat and stretched out on a long  
table..." to insert a speculum into herself  
so that each of "fifty women present could  
take a flashlight and look inside."  

By this action, women rejected the male  
gynecologist's cold, insulting examination--  
a situation in which the woman somehow feels  
that she should apologize for her sex, in  
which the gynecologist is a high priest ob-  
viating the “blood, birth and death" that is  
woman.  

The reader could argue that the Self-  
Help Center's suggestion that women repeated  
ly dash the hated drape to the doctor's exam  
ination room floor is unnecessarily violent,  

but then the treatment women have suffered  

at the gynecologist's hand is unnecessarily  
violent.  

Frankfort also reports on the "period  

extraction” method advocated by the Los  

Angeles Self-Help Center. This procedure  
employs a syringe and tube device that  
allows a woman to extract her menstrual  

flow by herself, in five minutes. Period  
extraction is the opposite pole from Freud's  
assertion that "Anatomy is Destiny". For  

in this procedure lies the final and  
complete control of woman over her body.  

There is great merit in Frankfort's in-  
itial reaction to period extraction:  
"...concern about the immediate dangers or  
risks of a totally new device being tried  
out by man or woman ...."  

Naturally, the medical profession re-  
acts violently against the concept and has  
marshalled its considerable forces to argue  
against period extraction.  

Frankfort asserts that she still fears  
for the safety of women who attempt period  
extraction "...at this date...." But she  
also notes that the method is "truly orig-  
inal". And like all original concepts, the  
establishment flails at it.  

Frankfort's present fears for women's  
use of period extraction seem well-founded;  
indeed one might very seriously question  
the motivation for this procedure. Per-  
haps many women have bought wholesale the  
male concept that to be female is to be  
dirty, sexually menacing and inferior  
because of the menstrual cycle. The claims  
of males that females are ruled by their  
"cyclical natures" is nonsense.  

Thus women should closely examine their in-  
terest in period extraction.  

Possibly even more important than  
Frankfort's report on the "revolutionary"  
activities of the Self-Help Center is her  
vividly written account of women's (and  
all minorities') treatment at the hands of  
the American Medical Profession.  

The author reports on women and psy-  
chiatrists. At the outset psychiatrists  
were the only persons to whom women could  
reveal their dissatisfactions with their  
domestic universe. However, the male psy-  
chiatrist maintained and elaborated on the  
power relationships that rule male society.  
(Frankfort wryly notes the baroque device  
of psychiatrists' maintaining separate en-  
trances and exits so patients would never  
meet one another, a trick contributing to  
the mystique of the all-mighty male.) She  
feels psychiatry failed so many women  
"...Partly because, while the technique of  
psychoanalysis might have something in  
common with consciousness-raising, the the-  
ory was filled with assumptions about women  
based on the limited experiences and in-  
sights of one man...." Freud.  

Frankfort is kind to Freud. She be-  
lieves that were he alive today he would see  
the error of his "Anatomy is Destiny" dic-  
tum. That is doubtful but irrelevant. For  
now women are not afraid to question the  
sacrosanct rituals of the psychiatrists and  
may be able to truly free themselves  
from the pressures of mediocre analysts,  
trying to mold women into HAPPY super-con-  
sumers or domestic servants.

“Politics. .-  
continued from page 8  

Frankfort devotes entire chapters to:  
Abortion, Drugs, Cancer and VD. But one of  
the most enlightening sections deals with  
Dr. William Nolen's best-seller, The Making  
of a Surgeon. Frankfort fully reveals the  
moral void that is the American Medical Es-  
tablishment. In the Chapter, "Do Unto  
Others", she reports on Dr. Nolen's "in-  
sider's" report on the development of a  
jejune medical student into an august  

_attending staff man.  

There is Dr. Nolen's jocular admission  
that physicians actively solicit surgical  
patients (frequently among those who re-  
quire nothing more than a programmed diet).  
The scramble for surgical engagements  
springs from the doctor's desire to break  
the magical $100,000 per annum mark.  

Dr. Nolen's book details the elabor-  
ate machinations of interns to avoid being  
caught in an error. One patient, critically  
ill with cancer of the bowel, developed  
staphylococcal enteritis following surgery  
and treatment with antibiotics that destroy  
infection-fighting bacteria.  

A young intern "who liked wild ideas"  
treated the patient with an elixir chiefly  
composed of another patient's bowel move-  
ment.  

Then began the game of hiding the  
exact nature of the potion from the intern’s  
resident, who in turn closed his eyes and  
hoped the patient would survive so the  
attending staff man would not learn of the  
unorthodox medication.  

As the intern sagely noted: "If Mrs.  
Swan doesn't make it and anyone hears what  
we've done, we'll be castrated (underlining  
is the reviewer's). Don't write a word on  
the chart about this and keep your mouth  
shut.

In this anecdote lies the dilemma of  
Americans and their doctors. We have cre-  
ated a group of often ill-educated elitists  
who, WITH NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, are more con-  
cerned about consulting the ever-growing  
roster of "physicians' management" journals  
than in keeping abreast of their profession  
or reforming the bankrupt health care sys-  
tem.  

These management journals are an om-  
inous sign that doctors will become more  
entrenched in the system if allowed to  
contemplate the problems of budgeting on  
a $90,000 annual income. (One recent journal  
actually carried such an article.)  

Certainly, women are in the very best  
position to know of the inequities of our  
health care system. And since women are  
the major consumers of prescription tran-  
quilizers, diet pills, etc., since women  
have suffered the most consistently at the  
hands of physicians, it seems appropriate  
that women should effect the reform of  
American health care.  

To forestall the inevitable cries that  
many physicians are dedicated, socially-  
conscious individuals, let it be noted that  
Frankfort reports on fine and concerned  
older physicians and a growing and dedica-  
ted group of young, "radical" physicians.  
It is the system that Frankfort indicts.  

A one-time medical student, she is  
well-qualified to report on the politics  
of medicine. She is a health columnist for  
the "Village Voice" and was recently hon-  
ored with an award from the Media Workshop  
for being "the first writer to combine  
health issues with feminist politics".  
Frankfort's book reflects exhaustive  
research and personal dedication to the  
dilemma of American women--and American  
society--trying to get well with the help  
of sick medicine.

REVOLUTION ...

or only Turn-around

Movement, it's pause and
reflect time. Are you really
revolutionary, rejecting the
white, male values of
society; or are you a reapp-
lication of those old, un-
acceptable values?

Ideally, your strength
would be self-respect; it
would show itself in a
strong love for all human be-
ings. You would strive for
full human rights for every
person. You would renounce
the self-serving expediency
of the Great White Father.

Movement, you are failing
to live up to your ideals
in two ways. One is in hat-
ing men. We must realize
that men can be a danger,
that they share the power
that has kept us subservient
for so long. We must view
them with some suspicion.
But we must realize that
they, too, are victims of
society, cast into roles, and
deprived of the freedom to
be fully human; and that
women, too, perpetrate the
male chauvinist mistake.

Mothers buy dolls for
their daughters as much as
fathers do. Women respond
to female supervisors as bad-
ly as men do.

In hating men, you are
claiming that men are infer-
ior--you are prejudging. Need
I remind anyone of how in-
human pre-judgment can be?
We are familiar enough with
blanket hatred of groups to
recognize that hatred is a
sign of a weak, small person,
and that hatred is emotion-
ally disabling to the hater.

People who hate find their
abilities to respond with
love to anyone atrophied.

Hatred of groups is the very
thing we're fighting against.
The movement message should
be that neither sex is in-
ferior; we are all equal.

Our other failure to ad-
here to our true humanitar-
ian goals is on the question
of abortion. How ironic
that a movement that pretends
to spurn white male American
values adopts them when it
serves their purposes! No
one can be anti-war and pro-
abortion. Both are murders
of convenience, disposable
people, the easy way out.
Unseen, helpless people, a
bother. Didn't we learn early
in life that violence solves
no problems?

Some say the fetus is not
really a person. They call
it a "growth", like cancer.
Yet the fetus' cells are
not homogeneous like any
other growth in the body.
The fetus has all the differ-
ent kinds of cells that you
or I have, or that a baby
two months after birth has,

or that a baby two months be-

fore birth, or four months
before, or six months be-
fore. In fact all
these cells are formed be-
fore you miss your first per-
iod. She (the fetus) is a
living person, though in a
different form than post-

natal life. 
Population control is

essential--so take the pill,
tie the vas, use the condom.
There are effective ways to

prevent conception.
The number of women who

die at the hands of quacks
is unforgivable; the num-
ber of babies who die as a
result of abortions is high-
er. Would we put bullet-

proof vests on the people
who are pointing the guns?

The backbone of the pro-
abortionist's argument is
that a woman should have the
right to control her own
body. I agree. But they
are closing their eyes to
the fact that (except for
nine months) it's NOT THEIR
BODY that is in question--
it is the baby's.

The pro-abortion and anti-
abortion movements are a
superbly ironic contrast.
The pro-lifers are mostly
rich, white, Establishment
males. They use the abor-

tion question as a politi-

cal issue to keep women down.
Pro-abortionists are just as
American in their own way,
determined to achieve their
own "freedom" at the cost of
anyone else's freedom or
life. No one, it seems, is
really concerned about the
person who is most con-
cerned--the unborn child.

It is a misplacement of
priorities to kill a prob-
lem rather than try to
solve it. We should be im-
proving ways to care for
children, not kill them. The
most liberated among us are
still not liberated from
American Establishment val-
ues.

Please, women, show me
that our revolution is a
revolution, a real rejec-
tion of old values, a human
movement tidal wave that in-
cludes women, men and un-
born babies.

Is denying the rights of
others the way to get our own?

Can we say, "Big White
Daddy can't hate or kill,
but we can"?

Some 200 women from Duluth participated in

an all day conference Nov. 11.

The conference

was planned by a group of women who have been
meeting together in a consciousness-raising
group every Wednesday night for the past two

years.

Child care provided,

Small group discussions were held,
and a feminist group from

Minneapolis presented a multi-media show called

“Where Am I Now That I Need Me?"
the Minnesota Women's Political

Women Voters,

The League of

Caucus, and the Women's Advisory Committee of
the State Department of Human Rights were co-

operating agencies.

LECTURES  
PLANNED  
ATU OF M  

Five prominent academic  
women will appear at the Univ-  
ersity of Minnesota this quart-  
er in conjunction with an Amer-  
ican Studies course called "The  
Effects of Feminism on Ameri-  
can Intellectual Life." (Am St-  
3-801).  

Anne Firor Scott, Carroll  
Smith Rosenberg, Jacquelyne J.  
Jackson and Carolyn Kizer will  
present public lectures as well  
as meeting with course partici-  
pants. The fifth speaker has not  
yet been announced.  

"We have sought women with  
respectable academic credentials,  
rather than first looking for  
feminist credentials," says  
course coordinator Elsa Greene.  
"They will address themselves to  
the question of whether others  
in their field are affected by  
feminism.  

"We will focus," continues  
Greene, "on the fact that the  
first feminist movement failed  
to acquire additional status for  
women—we can vote but do not have  
much power. This time, are fund-  
amental values being changed?"  

Historian Anne Firor Scott  
inaugurates the program on Jan-  
uary 15. Senior Fellow at the  
Johns Hopkins Institute of South-  
ern History, Scott is a special-  
ist in the history of southern  
women. Not a recent convert to  
the discipline, she has been a  
historian of women since the  
1940s.  

On January 31, Carroll  
Smith Rosenberg, assistant prof-  
essor of history and psychiatry,  
at the University of Pennsylvania,  
will discuss the history of psy-  
chiatric thought. Rosenberg has  
studied the hysterical woman from  
a historical perspective. She  
has also studied lesbian women.  
In addition, she has researched  
the development of women's hist-  
ory as a discipline, and its re-  
lation to psychological theories  
of women.  

Sociologist Jacquelyne Jack-  
son, associate professor of medi-  
cal sociology at Duke University  
and chairman of the Black Soci-  
ologists Caucus of the American  
Sociology Association, will speak  
February 14 on the relation of  
Black women to the dominant soc-  
iety and to feminism. A Black  
activist, she will also address  
herself to the effect of feminism  
on social theories.  

Poet Carolyn Kizer, director  
of the graduate writing program  
at Columbia University and author  
of "Pro Femina," appears Feb-  
ruary 28 to discuss poetry and  
feminist consciousness.  

All lectures are open to the  
public with no admission charge;  
all begin at 8 p.m. in Murphy  
Hall Auditorium, University of  
Minnesota Campus.  

COLLEGES EXPAND  

WOMEN’S  

While no college or univ-  
ersity in the Twin Cities area  
has yet announced establishment  
of a women's studies department,  
courses in that field are becom-  
ing more numerous, a recent sur-  
vey of local institutions of  
higher learning indicates.  

The following list, while  
not exhaustive, reveals that  
academic departments—especially  
English, history and sociology—  
have designed courses relating  
to women's attempts to define  
themselves, their culture and  
their history.  

Courses which are primarily  
geared to the study of racial  
minorities have also been includ-  
ed in this listing, which covers  
the University of Minnesota's  
winter quarter and the spring  
semester at other local colleges.  
Information on registration pro-  
cedures and tuition may be  
obtained from the colleges.  

At Hamline, courses in Ed-  
ucation and Cultural Diversity  
(Ed. 62, 12:30, MWF) and Racial

semester opening February 5, the  
following are offered: Exist-  
ential Woman (Fr 50-01, 3:30 MWF)  
Woman and Social Structure (Soc  
50-01, TBA); and Literature and  
Social History (Eng 50-09, 11:30

RAPE CENTER  
OPENS JAN. 13  

The Twin Cities Women's  
Rape Crisis Center, sche-  
duled to open on Jan. 15,  
is seeking volunteers for  
the 24-hour service.  

According to organizer  
Rita Gallagher, volunteers  
are needed to answer tele-  
phones and provide research  
assistance; training will  
be provided during the  
weeks before the center's  
official opening.  

The Rape Crisis Center  
will be a 24-hour telephone  
service; legal advocacy,  
self-defense classes, dis-  
cussion groups for rape  
victims, and abortion re-  
ferrals are among the ser-  
vices it will provide.  

Women interested in aid-  
ing the Rape Crisis Center  
can call Gallagher at 729-  
2779; the first training  
session is slated for the  
last week of December. Con-  
tributions are welcome.  

Women Speakers  
Outline Affirmative  
Action Plans  

A workshop to inform wo-  
men of the "affirmative  
action" provisions of fed-  
eral regulations is planned  
for late January.  

Beginning at 9:30 a.m.  
on January 27, the work-  
shop will feature speakers  
from the Departments of  
Labor and Housing and Ur-  
ban Development, as well  
as local women.  

There is no admission  
charge for the workshop,  
sponsored by the Minneapo-  
lis Model City program;  
the event is scheduled for  
Sabathani Community Center,  
32404 Let Ave. S.  

Mary Manning, regional  
director of the Department  
of Labor's Women's Division  
will keynote the workshop  
at 10 a.m. She will be  
followed by Joanne Munday,  
HUD Federal Women's program

Local attorney Ellen Dres-  
selheuis and HUD official  
Frances Boelter will also  
present information on  
equal employment opportu-  
nities under the new laws  
and regulations.  

After a bag-lunch break,  
the speakers will lead  
workshops in their areas of  
specialization. Department  
of Labor official Phil  
Grandquist will also be on  
hand to discuss employee  
rights in an afternoon  
session.  

All area women are wel-  

come to participate in the  
workshop, which is "inten-  
ded to introduce women to  
their rights, and to the  
ways they can take action  
if they feel they have been  
discriminated against," ac-  
cording to workshop organ-  
izer Frankie Quade.

PENTAGRAPHS  

By Arcotti  

More evidence of women's  
lost history: astrology  
reference books list only  
Betsy Ross, Ava Gardner,  
Loretta Young and Mrs. Cal-  
vin Coolidge as models of  
the Capricorn woman.  

But as Capricorn is famed  
for its ambition, we  
thought it peculiar that  
so few had apparently suc-  
ceeded. Researching fur-  
ther (in feminist journals)  
we found the following  
women born under the sign  
of the sea-goat: Lucretia  
Mott, Carrie Chapman Catt,  
Alice Paul, Abbey Kelley  
Foster, Simone de Beauvoir,  
Anne Bronte, Rebecca West  
and Joan of Arc. As impres-  
sive a list of feminists  
as we are likely to find  
in any sign of the zodiac,  
but oddly omitted from the  
official astrological list.  

Capricorn women have his-  
torically been active in  
the women's struggle: like  
Alice Paul, they are among  
the most persevering of  
feminists. Capricorn is  
steadfast, ambitious, de-  
termined; Capricorn is also  
astutely political, for  
natives of this sign clear-  
ly see the social ladder  
and innately know how to  
clamber up it.  

Unfortunately, this same  
driving ambition and shrewd  
practicality leads many Ca-  
pricorn women to seek sue-  
cess where they are most  
likely to find it--in the  
home, under the wing (thumb)  
of a promising, protective  
male. Hence many become  
"powers behind the throne,"  
women who demand that mate  
and offspring vicariously  
fulfill their own repressed  
ambition.  

Capricorn is the quintes-  
sentially social sign. Born  
when the sun (ego-energy)  
was at its yearly nadir, the  
Capricorn native gains per-  
sonal satisfaction from ad-  
hering to tradition, in a  
curious mingling of the per-  
sonal and the social. And,  
like R. Nixon, they are born  
politicians, canny and  
shrewd in their estimation  
of the lowest common social  
denominator.  

The Capricorn woman, if  
she abandons rigid adherence  
to women's traditional role,  
makes the best critic of  
that role--as is attested by  
the work of Simone de Beau-  
voir. Practical and clear-  
sighted, the Capricorn fem-  
inist deals with social re-  
alities in a comprehensive  
manner, never mistaking  
"ought to be" for "is."

as well as:

And though we allow

Early morning-morbid decrepit  
souls all around me  
The depression was  
nearly shock--  
The white man all  
around.  
Didn't know who to  
Learn to--  
Where to go--  
Herbie Mann jams  
loud & clear--I think  
he's really here--but there  
is no one.  
Flute, Flute, sound, of  
quiet beauty.  
My legs started to water  
wondering  
Why?  
I took a pause  
to look out the door  
Just to see  
if anything was going on.  
Then you walked  
through--Handcuffs  
Binding your powerful hands--  
a look of hatred &  
pity combined...  
Something rarely seen.  
The words flowed out of your lips  
like the tide--  
Happiness came  
to me--For I have looked for  
someone who was  
for real. Now  
I have found that one--

Early morning  
Beauty surrounds me.

Death’s Door  

Oh Mother Mary darkness is hard,  

My eyes are pinched circles  

Hiding in my skull.  

Get behind me monster, I say,  

(But it won't)  

Curled in a bundle of fright,  

Oh Mary you must save me  

From myself or before long  

My cell will have opened:  

A cage with no door,  

Simple apparatus designed for comfort  

For villains in strange shape,  

With hollow faces and icy limbs.  

I won't stir anymore then  

You'll speak to me in code.  

My heart is stone dear,  

Since I was eight, my chemistry changes  

Practicing secrecy became my game,  

Then essential to well being.  

Mother turned her back, I was too clever  

A child, and now sorrow, a slow spreading  
hate  

Eats away my bones.  

Mother Mary my prayers must be heard.  

Awful incantations hang inside my head:  

You wonderful creature, said the Third Voice  

Only an angel could be that blind.  

Tired of the kitchen, mops, and old bread  

Sickness is breeding,  

She's already half dead.  

I'll age you in silence, a dreadful  
surprise,  

You'll spring up mad  

Before their eyes.  

Her husband, the father figure for unknown  
females  

Worries over careers, occupations and thus  

Needs her for a victim in case he fails.  

O Mary Great Mother that you are  
You must see that this is all too futile  
Problems in domesticity  

While I crawl on the floor,  

Hoping for tranquility,  
Waiting at death's door.  

--Marlene Maynard  

Mother Why  

Why did you feed me lies  
And pour promises down  
My throat--  

{(Prying open my mouth  
With a meat cleaver  
When I grew unresponsive?)  
Assaulting my hope  
With giant decaying  
Sighs of doom;  

You grimly sought  

To mangle my appetites  
To suit  

Your taste.  

With great pressure  
You applied  

Spectre bandages  

To the wounds you  
Imagined I had,  

Until I had not  

Blood nor bone,  
Whereupon you slept.

“there's a certain thing that happens when you do a

concert that's very exciting. I get off on a good
concert. I mean, I get more pleasure from that than
I get from almost anything I can think of, except

a couple of things. It's about on a line with good
sex and really close relationships with friends.

It's very high. I couldn't go through all the agony
of all that traveling if it wasn't that great. You
know, it wouldn't be worth it.’

Judy Collins . Crawdaddy ... October 1972

There isn't much to say about Judy Collins that
anyone who's interested doesn't know already. Being
at one of her concerts tells the whole story. Those
of us who have been know; to those who haven't I can
only say go for heaven's sake the next time she's in
town. You will probably never spend a couple of
bucks on an evening that will be more enjoyable than
the live experience of her music. The only thing
that was a drag was paying $6 to sit in the 9th row
by the door because that's sort of big business es-
tablishment prices which deprive a lot of people from
a really nice experience. Joan Baez has the right

idea in minimizing the ticket prices at her concerts.
Why haven't other biggies taken the hint? Anyway, I

guess one must consider the entertainer. And then
one must consider the entertained. (hopefully) And
it could be put another way in these shriveled times:
sometimes it is relevant to consider the stars and
fans. I was of the latter malady for what I realize
as too many years. Oh yeah, Judy and me, we go way
back. Of course, she ‘doesn't know that but that an-
onymity is necessary for my fan identity. Annie with
her photo-genic memory remembers just when it was
that she and Peter and I trucked through the snow
for the first live J.C. experience. Something like
a 63 or 64 winter. Smack in the middle of the days
when you could tell just how hip someone was by the
way they pronounced Dylan. (die-lan?) (Zimmerman,
who's he?) Those were the Philly and Newport folk
festival years when the Beatles still knew their
place and cynicism was just an edge not a way of
life. And in talking about the days of folk, one
fails unless one mentions the Club 47 in Cambridge,
Mass. where supposedly it all began. Out here in
the north-midwest, I don't suppose that means much
(except this IS Zimmerman-country). But the 47 was
where folk was at and Judy Collins as well as Tom
Rush, Judy Henske, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Barbara
Dane, the Chambers Brothers as well as innumerable
others served their time as true folk-heroes, until

its demise several years ago because of lack of funds.

But the 47's memory looms fondly on. Yes, it was
there that N & I waited for hours in the drizzlings
to get first row seats to ensure the nurturing of
our compulsive habit of visually devouring J.C. to
bits. Of course, there are different levels of de-
vouring and absorption. As I found out later, N.
was plugging into the sexual fantasy trip a bit
more than I (if only in its acknowledgement) which is
only to say that she was somewhere between gazing at
and cruising J.C. (the demarcation zones of which
position have always been rather nebulous) and I
was just at the intent gaze stage. For myself, who
was born a bit too late to know instinctively about
ancient and virtually lost arts such as cruising
(old dykes and 40's lesbians ought to give classes
in that fine art of visual massage), the mere sugg-

gestion that my affection (affliction?) for J.C. might
border on anything but the spiritual was unheard of.

So back to the drizzlings...
It got so that the waiting line in the worst of
weather became some kind of perverse endurance test
for true fans and we, the faithful, got to know and
expect each other.

Sometimes I wonder what has happened to us. Crazy
Evelyn must be through with Boston University by
now. And Carolyn Berkowitz—whose husband's canteen
truck I drove for two weeks one summer in Chelsea...
Last time I talked with her she said as far as

music lately, she'd really gotten into Sergio Mendes
Brazil 66 and I guess it was never really the same
after that summer I lost her license at Newport which
I had borrowed to drink beer and had been afraid to
tell her but some guy found it and mailed it back to
her and she said I should have told her and I knew
she was right. We never really talked after that.
And there were the kids who always gave Judy red
lollipops.

I sort of sensed the imposition on her (J.C.) then,
always having that frenzied 10 minutes of clawing
fans, demanding her answers and signatures, to

look forward to after each concert. But we forged on
undaunted: jogging in a half-crazed New Year's Eve
train to be there for her first Carnegie Hall con-
cert; literally scrounging the East Coast for her
shows for several years. The first time it occurred
to me that possibly some stars might feel their fans
as more of burdens than gifts was upon hearing
Albatross, one of her songs, in which there are the
lines: you must barter your life, to make sure

you are living, and the crowds that have come, you
give them the colours and the wind and the bells and
the dreams.

That was probably early '68 and already the marked
decline in star value had begun. Someone said some-
thing about how when your own life becomes important
enough, the need to foster star images vanishes and
from then on I caught her concerts when I could —
averaging about one a year. Somewhere between those
steadfast vigils at the Club 47 to barely catching
that immodest concert last week in St. Paul, 7 years
later, the world has become less small and star and
fan trips have opted out for more humane pursuits
(?) and let me say that we deserve it.

The secret gardens of the heart
will they stay young forever

I see you shining in the night
in the ice and snow of winter

I went to my grandmother's funeral in Seattle and
drove by the house she used to live in. I saw the
house on the corner and was stunned—it's so little...
there's nothing.

It's a dumb little house on the corner in Seattle, but
in my head it's the most lush, florid, vivid, sen-
sual, pleasurable, complicated, marvelous place in
the world. In my memory, in my imagination.

And I realized as we went by that nobody knows that

Se: J.C... Crawdaddy... October '72)
Velleda-- --

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN

Simone de Beauvoir is a writer of defini-
tive works. When she breaks subject ground,
as she did with The Second Sex in 1949, she
does not stop excavation until a firm histor-
ical foundation has been made, nor building
until the structure of the present is sound.

While her books have been hailed as pion-
eer studies, her singular genius is choosing
subjects that are long overdue for a wide-
ranging, sensible analysis. She is not
ahead of her time; rather, she reminds her
contemporaries of the serious lags and lapses
in their understanding of the world.

Her latest book, The Coming of Age (Putnam,
$10.00, 585 pages) puts capital letters on
Old Age just as surely as her earlier mas-
terpiece did on Woman. With an organiza-
tional scope that encompasses science, an-
thropology, history, and the arts, in fact,
most of the basic avenues of knowledge, de
Beauvoir discusses old age as if it has
never been mentioned before....and it
scarcely has been.

Aging is a universal process which is
largely disguised or ignored. For all its
awesome implications, death itself is more
comprehensible to most individuals than the
prospect of an inevitable decline in their
mental and physical powers down into decre-
pitude. The elderly so often live in pover-
ty, ridicule, and lonely misery because
those with youth and power refuse any iden-
tification with their frightening condition.

In de Beauvoir's existentialist vocabulary
old people are the Other, the not-me, and
they are subjected to the traditional neg-
lect and cruelty that the "thems" of society
have always experienced.

Women have belonged to the ranks of "them"
all their lives, so their slide into old age
seldom assumes the catastrophic dimensions
of the male decline. A woman's reduction is

gradual, and her losses are spread through-
out her life: the passing of beauty, depar-
ture of children, menopause, the death of a
husband.

Before she had gone very far in her re-
search, de Beauvoir realized that aging is
considered a man's problem. "As a personal
experience, old age is as much a woman's
concern as a man's - even more so, indeed,
since women live longer. But when there is
speculation upon the subject, it is consider-
ed primarily in terms of men. In the first
place because it is they who express them-
selves in laws, books and legends, but even
more because the struggle for power concerns
only the stronger: sex...

"In public life women's status is always
the same - that of perpetual minors. The
masculine state, on the contrary, changes
with the passage of time."

The Coming of Age is a disconcerting book,
particularly when it is being read for re-
view in a feminist newspaper. Could a long-
standing ally really be saying that men de-
serve center stage in yet another sphere of
life, that women are, once again, as always,
of secondary importance? Not quite. The si-
milarities between her present endeavor and
The Second Sex are not simply ones of
approach and ambitiousness.

What she is calling for in both books is a
change in supposedly “natural” conditions of
life. If women and the aged of both sexes
are confined to powerless, sad existences,
de Beauvoir wants us to understand where
biological destiny stops and social and his-
torical forces begin. To folks who say,
"That's life," she answers, "Then we will
change it."

But she does not arrive at this conclusion
until her readers are ready to come with her.
For all her versatility, de Beauvoir does
not write polemics. The Coming of Age is an imposing, objec-
tive undertaking that follows the trail of
old age down through the centuries. It ends
at the doorsteps of admired, mostly male in-

dividuals who have managed to establish hon-
ored residences in historical annals. But
however much men like Churchill, Tolstoy,
Freud, and Einstein may have accomplished in
their youth and middle age, they seldom re-
tained their powers or personalities once
they acknowledged the intrusion of age upon
their lives. A few, like Michelangelo, pos-
sessed a genius that stayed with them until
death, yet they lost all pleasure in their
still great feats.

The only women discussed with any detail
are Lou Andreas-Salomé, a novelist and fol-
lower of Freud, Sophia Tolstoy, and Juliette
Drouet, the lifelong mistress of Victor
Hugo. Sophia and Juliette are cited as
cases of elderly female jealousy, women tor-
mented by their men's sexual and mental in-
fidelities. Lou's "twilight" years were
happier. She became a psychotherapist at
sixty, and it was not until she neared her
deathbed that she asked that unanswerable,
debilitating question: "All my life I have
done nothing but work. And really, when
you come to think of it, why?"

De Beauvoir tirelessly piles up evidence
which testifies to the bleakness of old age
through diary excerpts, sociological data,
and personal and historical accounts. What
emerges, surprisingly, from all this infor-
mation is the minor place physical illness
or incapacity holds in the catalogue of
elderly evils.

Much of the pain old people endure is im-
posed on them from without in the forms of
abrupt retirement, neglectful children, so-
cial isolation, and confining poverty. Feel-
ings of despair are often products of their
own minds which have been conditioned to be-
lieve that the aged are tiresome, useless,
and ugly.

Too often, old age is viewed as a dis-
abling disease, just as menstruation was in
earlier times. Samuel Johnson once commen-
ted, "There is a wicked inclination in most
people to suppose an old man decayed in his
intellects. If a young man or middle-aged
man, when leaving a company, does not recol-
lect where he laid his hat, it is nothing;
but if the same inattention is discovered in
an old man, people will shrug up their shoul-
ders and say, ‘His memory is going.'"

The fatal power of suggestion is not just
a saying; it works, especially when it comes
from all sides, when it results from a life-
time's indoctrination. Old age is a normal
condition whose leading characteristics are,
paradoxically and inescapably, well-estab-
lished abnormalities. Sound familiar,
feminists?

As long as we live in societies whose cur-
rencies are negotiable power and marketable
sameness, those who cannot compete on these
crudely laid grounds will suffer - the old,
the young, women, Third World people...the
"unusual." Simone de Beauvoir, now 64 years
old, has written a book that should convince
us to reconsider our rates of human exchange
and denial.
