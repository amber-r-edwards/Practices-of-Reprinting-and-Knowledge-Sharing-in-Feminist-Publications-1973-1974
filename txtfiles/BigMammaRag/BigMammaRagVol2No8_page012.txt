Poetry =

Up like a dream,  
a vision, a face  
it’s gone.

Another cloud,  
another dream,  
another fantasy takes its place.

Close my eyes,

past, present, future,  
happy, happiest, she and me.

Catch the minutes,  
collect the sunshine—  
the fun, the laughter,  
catch it all.

Close your eyes,

run through the fields with me.

Feel the cool wet grass beneath our feet.  
Feel the heat of the sun.

Try to remember the blue skies of early afternoon.  
Watch the sunset and wish you were an artist,  
dashing your brush across your canvas,

capturing the greys, pinks and oranges.

REMEMBER a love—

her smile,

her kind eyes,

her warm soft hands.

She held you against her breast.

She winked and you thought your every bit of being  
would burst with happiness.

Reach out with me,

Really try to touch.

You weren’t meant to touch it all

but believe you can and you may.

Get out of yourself now and share your happiness.  
Share your love

to your wealth.

Believe in your sister.

Give her hours of relief from pain, from worry.  
Give her love—understand.

Touch her heart with all your caring,

touch her mind with yours,

Touch her soft body and be ever so gentle.

Touch her

bring her face a smile in the morning sunlight.

Touch her and hold her in the darkness of late night,  
her sweet breath will sigh before sleep comes.

You'll feel her body come to a calm

and you'll feel peace in your arms

Sleep now,  
be there again tomorrow,

REALLY BE THERE.  
SHE'LL KNOW.

Fourteen hours

and Burma-close  
knapsacked

backs

from the Chao Phya  
by jeep

by elephant

by hope

and dream-come-true  
we were  
garuda-carried

up three hundred

red gold dragon steps  
blessed

by the smiley-eyed  
yellowed  
orange-robed

monk

underneath a bo tree  
the place of Buddha’s birth  
a lithe Thai said.

One wish

to Buddha

on stone-chapped knees  
two cents per wish  
and mine a dollar

just to be sure  
Siddhartha means  
every wish fulfilled  
One wish to gold-leafed  
Siddhartha

One love wish

for you and me

and fourteen hours  
down

to Bangkok.

A postcard

from you now

and then  
Remembering,  
laughing, when

we were eagle-carried  
to a dream.

There,  
and back again.

To An Anonymous Woman Disc Jockey  
from an anonymous university secretary

The only reason, frankly,

that I was up so early,

was to take a shower, prepare

my body for the daily sacrifice;  
they pay me to sit at a desk

for eight hours — food

for hungry birds who pick

me clean by five.

So usually I don’t crawl out

until after sunrise, thickly protected  
with sleep like a cheap coat

that unravels slowly as I dance

on top of my brown, wooden

desk and perform all kinds of marvelous feats for money.  
By five, I'm a bloodshot parody of myself.  
But, as I said, I rose early

and turned on the radio — music  
morning jazz a woman's  
voice something about

a sunrise and I opened my door  
and there was rose grey

yellow blue

thank you. —Jeanne Winer

OUR MOTHERS—OURSELVES

Last night, I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
with raging Army feet all cast in silver spurs and I threw up and  
over everything I lay there waiting to be tramped again  
into the floor

she only looked at me—the silver shining from her eyes  
gleaming Army boots inside

When I was young she always listened

fed herself into her young

and never made a sparrow of a noise

We tramped her in the living room

Marched upon her in the garden, buried her with tulip bulbs,  
We pushed her down the stairs

and stuffed her in the kitchen sink to drown.

One time she came around

brandishing a chair into our faces upside down

A Lion Tamer pacing round and round

jabbing at the air and stomping

stomping up and down until she cried

she cried/ran down/slumped down upon the hardwood floor  
Last night I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
The silver tears ran down her eyes

Until I couldn't see her anymore/no more/  

no more...
