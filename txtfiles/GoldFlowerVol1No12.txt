As Gloria Steinem pointed out during her  
recent Midwest visit, every woman is a poten-  
tial welfare case, often “just one man away  
from welfare."  

It is an unpleasant economic fact that few  
women can earn enough to support a family  
without financial aid, either from a man or  
from the state. And it is an unpleasant so-  
cial fact that women who are forced to obtain  
the latter form of aid are castigated in pop-  
ular stereotype as "welfare loafers" despite  
the lack of the daycare centers and adequate jobs  
that would make employment possible for them.  

Public aid, usually in the form of Aid to  
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) per-  
mits single mothers to devote themselves to  
child care, but women are stigmatized by re-  
ceipt of such aid. In light of a recent  
University of Minnesota study which proved  
stereotypes of the "welfare mother" to be  
without foundation, GOLD FLOWER interviewed  
three such mothers who described their lives  
on AFDC; their names have been changed in  
the following story to protect their privacy.  

The UM study of 100 randomly-selected AFDC  
mothers in Hennepin County revealed that one-  
third of welfare mothers are employed at  
least part-time, and that 80 percent desire  
to work despite the difficulties employment  
would present. Only one recipient in 20 has  
never been married, while three-quarters  
have been married only once. Most welfare  
mothers are white; few have received aid for  
more than three years. The three mothers to  
whom we spoke provide a representative cross-  
section of these women.  

Rhonda is in her early twenties. The mo-  
ther of two pre-school children, she works  
part-time at a day care center. She enjoys  
her job but worries over the children, es-  
pecially her son who demands daily reassur-  
ances of her affection.  

Annie, a 33-year-old former social worker,  
has an infant daughter. Her four older chil-  
dren live with her former husband, but Annie  
sees them frequently. She is active in com-  
munity affairs and is anxious to return to  
work when her child is older.  

Three of Sally's children live at home; her  
oldest son lives in California. Poor health  
has prevented her from working for two years  
but recent surgery, she hopes, has corrected  
her ailments. She too is eager to return to  
work; in her 40 years she has held jobs ran-  
ging from domestic worker to secretary.  

To Rhonda, who separated from her husband  
recently, finances pose the biggest problem.  
"I get $125 for rent, for a two-bedroom fur-  
nished apartment, $60 for food stamps--that  
means about $105 worth of food for the month  
--and about $6 for phone," she says.  

"Of course we get medical and dental care,  
too. But there's no allowance for a damage  
deposit on an apartment, or for deposit or  
installation of a phone. So many people  
that you run into don't understand how much  
-or how little--money we really get.  

"I'm getting bitter," she admits. "It's  
really more hassle to work than sit at home."  

Because of her part-time job, she must pay  
babysitting and carfare costs out of her al-  
ready-pinched budget. She estimates that  
she has "about $10 a month" left after she  
pays her family's basic living expenses.  

"I don't even have enough to buy baby as-  
pirin," she sighs.  

Her parents, she says, live far away and  
"don't have money themselves to help." They  
feel that she “shouldn't be living off the  
state, that the kids' father should support  
them." Rhonda's husband is an unemployed  
craftsman.  

Rhonda maintains that she has faced dis-

For Women on Welfare

crimination because of her financial status.  
"I’ve called up apartments where they wouldn’t  
rent to me because I'm on AFDC. One  
landlady even told me not to report her,”  
she exclaims. "And the neighbors are often  
unsympathetic--they always seem to know if  
you're on AFDC or not.  

"So many people think we're lazy, that we  
don't want anything else," Rhonda says. "I  
have talked to so many welfare mothers, and  
I know this is untrue. Or landlords will  
say, the ‘last AFDC mother I had here was no  
good--the attitude is, you're all alike so  
why give you a chance."  

She worries about her children and how  
their financial plight will affect them.  

"I'm torn between my children and working.  
I really love my job. I feel useful and  
feel I'm helping the city--but every morning  

my son asks me,  
'You are coming home, aren't  
you mom?'"  

Rhonda's eyes fill as she speaks of her  
son's uncertainty.  

"I understand what the name ‘welfare moth-  
er' means and what you go through. I try my  
best to help people to change their mind,"  
Rhonda says.  

Annie is wryly amused at her current situa-  
tion. "I worked with AFDC mothers for  
years," she recalls. "I was doing group  
work with AFDC mothers in 1958."  

She and her second husband separated while  
she was pregnant; when a promised social  
work position did not materialize, she ap-  
plied for AFDC aid.  

She complains that welfare workers are of-  
ten unfeeling or unkind towards their  
clients. "Before my baby was born, I asked  
for a crib. The worker said I would have to  
wait four months, and 'til then, just use a  
big cardboard box.'” Fortunately, a crib was  
donated.  

Annie feels that she is equipped to cope  
with most of her problems. “But I'm educa-  
ted, I've worked for years, I should be able  
to cope with people," she says. "I don't  
know how women without such resources can  
cope with the situation."  

Sally, a middle-aged black mother, lacks  
Annie's education but has successfully dealt  
with her plight. "I hate it, I hate being  
on it (AFDC)," she says. "It can be a good  
thing when you need it, so I really don't  
want to put it down. But I want to go back  
to work as soon as I am able."  

Health problems have handicapped Sally for

Letters to the Editor:  
Dear Goldflower:  

Although your name is  
that of a Chinese peasant  
woman, your position is that  
of the NOW women, liberal,  
professional, reform-minded—  
whose goal seems to be a  
mirror of the male world: we  
now see around us.  

This leaves out in the  
cold the women who want a  
complete change, who had en-  
visioned Women's Liberation  
as bringing about a new era  
in which compassion and  
human emotion would change  
all the structures that  
exist today so they could  
operate freely. When you  
talk about working women or  
the housewife or the Chicano  
or the Black women you  
talk about them, you make  
no effort to reach them.  
With the paper the way it is  
today, there is nothing in  
it for them.  

Your way, of course, is  
safe and you will make gains  
for the middle-class  
professional woman. The way  
I advocate has nothing to  
offer but struggle for an  
ideal. To open the minds of  
working women and housewives,  
to organize them, to build  
bridges to our sisters who  
have different colored skin  
will be difficult indeed in  
this time of official govern-  
ment repression and fear  
and hate. Yet this is the  
road, I feel, which will  
lead to real liberation, not  
only of women, but of men.  
This road, I believe, has a  
chance of ridding our coun-  
try of the twin cancers of  
war and racism. Does any-  
one besides myself want to  
follow it? Do you dare to  
print this letter?

I wrote to the Minneapolis  
Tribune that hasn't been  
printed as far as I know.  

Letters  
Minneapolis Tribune  
Minneapolis, Minn.  

Dear Editor:  

The December 26 article by  
George Vessey, "More women  
hitchhike; more are assault-  
ed," exposes some often-  
heard biases. Considering  
that U.S. females earn lit-  
tle more than half of what  
males do for regular employ-  
ment, that we are systemati-  
cally discouraged and kept  
from access to the technolo-  
gy of automobile maintain-  
ance (and of weapons by the  
way), and that walking and  
mass transit dangers can  
leave one quite vulnerable,  
is it not surprising young  
women have become only a  
quarter of those resorting  
to hitching to make their  
way around? (I assume an-  
other fourth is not old  
women.)  

Though I've had some won-  
derfully good experiences  
while thumbing (usually a  
neglected aspect), I really  
wouldn't have minded being  
able to own and transport  
myself in the white busi-  
nessman's late model Buick  
in which I had the most  
fearful experience. I've  
read that in a European  
country (Czechoslovakia?)  
those who take the opportun-  
ity to drive cars are ex-  
pected to report the number  
of people to whom they give  
rides for the gas that's  
used. Those here who once  
abuse the privilege of shar-  
ing should be banned from  
the roads, not the needy  
travellers.  

If young women are statis-  
tically more subject to vio-  
lent crimes, the response  
should be training in self-  
defense and in practical  
hitchhiking skills, rather  
than legitimizing them as  
objects of violence. This  
seems to be happening when  
young men see a police cap-  
tain quoted as saying we  
(female hitchhikers) "prac-  
tically invite rape"—by our  
very existence apparently.  
When you see that the  
streets belong to the men,  
cars belong to the men, law  
enforcement also, and news-  
paper stories, you realize  
you have a place someone is  
trying to keep you in.  
"They placed themselves in a  
position where it could hap-  
pen to them," another police  
quote. Let's then name the  
game when I do retreat to  
the safety of one man's side  
—in his car or his house.  
How much protection racket  
and how much free choice in  
an atmosphere of justice and  
equality?

A Glad  
Goodbye  

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN  

?  

There are men who muse about making accep-  
tance speeches, but letters of resignation  
are more often the stuff of women's dreams.  

Shortly after my initiation into the ranks  
of scurrying working women, I too adopted a  
characteristic preoccupation. It was not  
"How to beat the Boss," a little too opti-  
mistic for us in those days. Rather, and  

sadly, it was "How to keep the Boss from  
beating you."  

And really, there was only one way - to  
quit. Sure, you might see him on the street  

and be free to grin and disappear. Sure,  
you could do your slave bit for him at the  
office with a manufactured irony, hoping  
that he would notice and be ashamed.  

But these private tactics were too subtle  
to take any effect, and I repeatedly found  
myself imagining that I was not typing his  
letter, but my own, whooping out my glad  
goodbye.  

I didn't get around to actually doing it  
for months. There were bad days, and then  
not-so-bad ones, depending on how fast the  
hours went. When a better job loomed up,  
quite unexpectedly, I found that writing a  
resignation letter took only a few minutes,  
and didn't really resemble my precipitous  
practice runs.  

Riding on a small backwash of conversa-  
tional confidence, I thought I could say my  
parting views best in person, believing that  
a blood and flesh human being would be hard-  
er to ignore than a piece of paper. But it  
all depends on what kind of flesh that human  
being wears; the girl-flesh I was wearing  
did not exactly strike dangerous honesty in-  
to the heart of my well-protected Boss.  

Our Man in Personnel hesitantly accepted  
my request for an exit interview. I had the  
backing of several women who were not leav-  
ing, who hoped I could ease their coming  
days by dredging up their multiple discon-  
tents from the depths of the corporate con-  
science.  

As I was escorted into his office, I deci-  
ded to assume a tentative approach and  
phrased the broad problems of working women  
in the narrower terms of educated women  
within his company.  

I could have spared him my delicacy. One  
thing frontrunning feminists have brought on  
all of us is instant visibility; experienced  
men like this personnel Boss now scent out  
"liberated women" as eagerly as government  
committees once tracked down past, present,  
and future Communists.  

So the statistics flew from his corner of  
the room into mine, followed shortly by apt  
comparisons. We spoke “relatively“ for a  
time. Despite my lowkey opener, he hit me  
with the high notes, sounding out the cor-  
porate defense with rapid-fire trills of in-  

nocence: "We try...you just don't know...  
other companies...this is a business world.  
growth...you can't expect..."  

I sat tight, maybe too tight. I suggested  
that we not talk about the triumphant ap-  
pointment of a woman to head teller after  
she had held the job for five years but not  
the title. Maybe we should consider what  
happened to the average woman in the com-  
pany, I said, as compared to the average  
man.  

Not a valid comparison I was told. Let's  
compare women's positions in our institution  
to those of women in other companies.  

It wasn't as if I hadn't been in circles  
before. But my ears began to churn and my  
throat swallowed when I didn't want it to.  
How could all my forthright intentions and  
painfully acquired knowledge be swallowed so  
effortlessly, without even riling the Boss'  
digestion? We were both in corners of the  

room, but it was easy to see who had trapped  
who.  

I didn't get anywhere that afternoon, and  
I lost a dose of confidence somewhere in  
that predictable contest. We still cannot  
take men on in their own territory, where  
their rules go, and ours stay hidden or mis-  
understood.  

In parting, the Boss said, "I don't have  
to listen to you because you're atypical,  
coming here and talking to me like this."  

I said, equally in parting, "If I had been  
typical, and not come to talk to you, then  
you'd have to listen to me? Is that what  
you mean?"  

"Yes, that's about it."  

And so it was.

Psycho-Historian:

b]

History’s Muse Reveals 19th
Century Women’s Rebellions

BY MARY HASTINGS

The liberation of Clio, muse of history,
and Sigmund Freud has loosened the grasp of
male chauvinism on the study of history and
psychiatry.

Carroll Rosenberg, psychiatrist and historian,
traced the roots of women's rebellion
against male control to Victorian America in
the second lecture of the "Feminism in Amer-
ican Intellectual Life" series.

Rosenberg, a "psycho-historian" special-
izing in 19th century American history,
addressed approximately 150 persons at 8 p.m.
January 31 in the University of Minnesota's
Murphy Hall Auditorium.

She is on the staff of the University of
Pennsylvania.

Rosenberg conceded that she began her
studies as a general social historian, not a
feminist.

But then she "came across the Women's
Moral Reform Society of New York." In the
activities of this Society, Rosenberg found
repudiation of the "male slant" on history
and psychiatry.

Rosenberg declared that the "strength and
tenacity of sexual roles in society" has far-
ranging effects on history and psychoanalytic
theories.

She admitted that this was a "rash" con-
cept in the academic world but the power re-
cumbent in the Women's Moral Reform Society
made her re-evaluate the male point of view
in history.

"Historians have traditionally viewed the
Women's Moral Reform Society as amusing,
Quixotic or neurotic," she noted.

But the organization fulfilled a number
of female needs in the 19th century—a per-
iod of major change in women's roles, when
they were moving to urban areas and begin-
ning to seek roles outside their homes and
families.

The Reform Society was an outgrowth of
the 19th century's philanthropic, religious
movement, which "showed a deep-seated anger
toward men."

The Society offered women an exclusively
female group, which demonstrated female sol-
idarity. It provided a newspaper for comm-
unication among women and allowed them to
"save male sinners," thus giving them an
opportunity to control male behavior.

By the 1840s and 1850s, the Society had
chapters in most states of the Union.

Carroll Rosenberg

With Clio freed from the strictures of
male history, Rosenberg dealt with the lib-
eration of Sigmund Freud and the violence
done to women by the 19th century concept of
acceptable female behavior.

Freud's model for the libido was a male
model, Rosenberg said. "Although his first
and most important patients were women, he
based his theories on his own insights rath-
er than on those of his female patients."
Because of Freud's concepts, for three-quar-
ters of a century women have been viewed as
variants from a male model.

"They have been characterized by passivi-
ty, masochism, narcissism and envy," Rosen-
berg added. "Only through child-bearing and
rearing could women be fulfilled."

Today, psychiatrists are starting to ask
new questions, largely because of the Women's
Movement," she continued.

One of the most important new questions
being asked centers on the question of hys-
teria as female role socialization in the 19th

Hysteria as Protest

century America.

"Hysteria was considered to be a quintessentially female disease, linked to the reproductive system. It had an infinity of symptoms with no physical basis."

Rosenberg suggested that hysteria may have been a protest against the traditional role of women in the Victorian era.

"Women chose to be sick instead of overtly deviant." But doctors displayed a significant level of hostility toward hysterics. "They felt women weren't acting as women should—the doctors were baffled as physicians and men.”

How did hysteria relate to the way 19th century women were raised?

"Many 19th century women reached maturity retaining a child-woman mentality; women were discouraged from displaying competition or mastery of 'male' skills. Overt anger and violence were forbidden to women.

These strictures resulted in women having weak ego structures and forced them into menial functions.

"Such character formation would be considered dysfunctional in a man," Rosenberg noted.

Because of the weak ego structures of many 19th century women, they often adopted hysterical behavior patterns to deal with stress.

Rosenberg dealt with one final issue previously obscured by the male historical viewpoint: The question of intimate friendships between members of the same sex in the 19th century.

"Some critics have called these friendships latently homosexual,” Rosenberg said. "But they have not taken 19th century structures into account. A study of such friendships can help us to understand bisexuality and homosexuality."

Rosenberg explained that there was a widespread, culturally accepted behavior pattern of intense friendships between members of the same sex in the 19th century. She focused on intense friendships between women.

"Correspondence could play a large role in women's emotional lives at that time.

An emotionally viable female world emerges from these letters, in which men play only a shadow role." Nineteenth-century women lived in an all-female world and men even more so in an all-male world.

Relations between the sexes were difficult because of sexual taboos.

She noted that the 19th century pattern of intense friendships could help us to view sexuality as a continuum affected by social norms and cultural environment.

"The 19th century permitted easy movement across these sexual boundaries."

Rosenberg interprets such friendships in light of Freud's belief in all people's bisexuality and the sexual nature of all love.

As paradoxical as it may seem, Rosenberg concluded, perhaps the Victorian sexual structure was more supportive of individuals than our sexual mores. The third lecture of the series will be February 14 in Murphy Hall Auditorium. Sociologist Jacquelyne Jackson will speak on the relation of Black women to the dominant society and to feminism. All lectures are free and open to the public.

Solidarity Meeting

She added that such national women's movement leaders as Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug have been invited to participate.

The meeting will center on the international struggle for abortion rights. Mutnik said participants can also use the meeting as an opportunity to draw together reports about how the Supreme Court decision on abortion is being implemented throughout the country.

The March 10 meeting will convene in lieu of a previously planned weekend-long International Abortion Tribunal.

PENTAGRAPHS. *

The sea-green color that corresponds  
to the twelfth zodiacal sign could  
readily signify the envy which Piscean  
women inspire in their sisters.

But women born under the sign of the  
fish are more cursed than blessed by  
its astrological influence, for Pis-  
ces women satisfy our cultural re-  
quirements of "femininity" from the  
moment they open their liquid eyes.

Born under a sign not given to self-  
assertion, the Pisces woman is neither  
inwardly goaded nor outwardly guided  
to self-knowledge.

Pisces of both sexes are often lan-  
guid, purposeless beings, better  
dreamers than achievers, better poets  
than physicists. Alas for the Pisces  
man, for our society demands that men  
deny those tender qualities that char-  
acterize this sign; many a Pisces man  

has escaped into drink, drugs or self-

deprecation from this social pressure.  
Alas too for the Pisces woman, for her  
insidious conditioning merely rein-  
forces the worst traits of her signs:  
indecision, escapism, delusion, ro-  
manticism, qualities encouraged if not  
treasured by our society in its women.

With this negative reinforcement it  
is difficult for the Pisces woman to  
discover her potential and fulfill it.  
The sign's admirable qualities--imagination,  
empathy, self-transcendence--  
are so easily confused with its dele-  
terious traits that the Pisces woman,  
driven neither by inward nor outward  
demands, may never distinguish the pos-  
itive manifestations from the negative.

If Pisceans often evoke envy from  
other women, they must conversely be-  
ware of their conviction of feminine  
identity molded themselves.

Piscean women often fail to understand

Pisces is too often a victim looking  
to claim as "woman's place."

In this light it is instructive to  
consider Anais Nin's diaries. The Pis-  
ces writer was long in recognizing her  
own complex motivations; she enjoyed  
masculine acclaim for her "femininity,"  
even considering herself the mythic  
woman men told her she was. The slow  
painful mergence of self in Nin's  
diaries should prove an inspiring les-  
son for the Pisces woman.

Other women born under this twelfth  
zodiacal sign include Angelina Grimke,  
Edna St. Vincent Millay, Emma Willard,  
Mary Lyon, Rosa Luxemburg, and Eliza-  
beth Barrett Browning.

Abortions Legal,  
But Costly  

Northwestern Hospital, while  
Nora Shroeder of Mt. Sinai em-  
phasizes that “we will work  
with private physicians connec-  
ted with the hospital."  

Most other local hospitals  
have not yet announced their  
abortion policies.  

Recognizing that "most women  
would rather stay here," Ms.  
Johnson of WCS points out,  
"There's an overload here al-  
ready. Minneapolis doctors are  
not yet experienced in the pro-  
cedures. We are referring  
women who need salines or D&Cs  
(mid-pregnancy abortions) to  
local doctors, but under 12  
weeks we're still referring to  
New York."  

Welfare Pays,  
Blue Cross  
Hesitates...  

Women on welfare can have  
abortions without cost, but  
women covered by Blue Cross  
health insurance cannot.  

Executive Jim Keeler of Blue  
Cross has no comment as to that  
major health insurance agency's  
stand on abortion coverage,  
calling it “a volatile issue"  
and commenting that "the matter  
is under exhaustive study."  

However, a Feb. 8 directive  
from assistant director Frank  
Palmer of the welfare department  
read in part, "In inquiries re-  
ceived from recipients or from  
the medical community in refer-  
ence to payment for abortions,  
the staff response will be that  
abortion is a matter between  
the client and her physician.  

"If the physician recommends  
abortion," the statement con-  
tinues, “and we are billed for  
this medical service by a lis-  
censed medical vendor or medi-  
cal facility, payment will be  
made from Title 19 (Medicaid)  
fund."  

Welfare recipients, including  
women receiving Aid to Families  
with Dependent Children (AFDC),  
will be referred to welfare  
department counseling services  
should they seek abortion coun-  
seling, the statement further  
states.  

Despite the recent Supreme  
Court ruling allowing abortions  
up to six months after concep-  
tion, women in the Twin Cities  
will find prices high, doctors  
inexperienced and hospital reg-  
ulations obstructive, a recent  
survey showed.  

Three counseling services  
revealed that they will contin-  
ue to provide referrals to wom-  
en in need of abortions, al-  
though some will be advised to  
seek such medical aid in an-  
other state.  

"Things are changing so fast,"  
says Pam Johnson of the Women's  
Counseling Service, while Paula  
Wendt of Abortion Counseling  
Service says, "The Supreme  
Court Decision took us all by  
surprise."  

Both services--WCS at 827-  
3819 and ACS at 545-8085--  
are referring callers to local  
physicians associated with a  
hospital which provides facil-  
ities for pregnancy termina-  
tion.  

"But we are still referring  
about ten women a week out of  
state,” says Ms. Wendt. “We pro-  
bably receive 50-60 calls a  
week. Before the law was changed  
we saw that many women person-  
ally each week, but we aren't  
keeping a record of the number  
of phone referrals now."  

* Abortion Counseling Service,  
one of the first such agencies  

in the state, will close after  

the "transitional period," Ms.  

Wendt disclosed.  

Women's Counseling Service  
is still referring many callers  
to clinics in New York or other  
states with liberal abortion  
laws. According to Ms. Johnson,  
"It is still cheaper for many  
women to go to New York, parti-  
cularly under 12 weeks. We pro-  
vide about 20 referrals a week  
to New York clinics. The price  
is about $100 there, plus trans-  
portation--a total of about $217  
if you fly standby."  

She compares this to the $225  
announced price for abortions  
at Twin Cities hospitals.  

Another local counseling  
service, Planned Parenthood,  
will “maintain the referral  
policy for those who elect to  
have abortions," says executive  
director Thomas Weber. "And  
we will watch closely as health  
facilities begin to provide this  
service. After the health sys-  
tem decides what it will do, we  
will assess the care offered  
against Planned Parenthood  
standards and then make decisi-  
ons about local referrals."  

Weber says that Planned Par-  
enthood is still providing out-  
of-state referrals at this time.  

Several local hospitals, in-  
cluding Abbott-Northwestern,  
Hennepin General, and Mt. Sinai,  
have recently announced that  
they will provide facilities  
for doctors to perform abor-  
tions. "We are prepared to  
offer facilities to those of  
our medical staff who ask for  
and are approved for the priv-  
ilege," said Robert Miller of

"The wheel that creaks  
most gets the most oil,"  
Mary Manning of the U.S.  
Department of Labor told  
an audience of 150 women at  
last week's Equal Employment  

Rights Workshop. "Women  
must be knowledgeable about  
their rights, and make  
others knowledgeable.  
Otherwise we'll be put on  
the back burner for years."  

Ms. Manning, Regional Dir-  
ector of the Department's  
Women's Division, charged  
that women “are losing  
ground, not gaining it,"  
in the struggle for equal  
employment rights, noting  
that "40 percent of cases  
involving employment dis-  
crimination are brought in  
regards to sex discrimina-  
tion."  

Ms. Manning was keynote  
speaker at the Model City  
sponsored employment work-  
shop, held on January 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center.  
She described the cultural  
conditioning that “makes  
women show their hemlines  
but not their brains. To  

be intelligent or highly  
educated is unfeminine,  
though studies show that  
brain power is equally dis-  
tributed between the sexes.  
What is not equally distrib-  
uted is use of brain power."  
Ms. Manning maintained that  
women must take responsibil-  
ity for their career ad-  
vancement. “Women have  
waited for too long for Sir  
Galahad to come and save  
them--have waited, been stu-  
pid and been very quiet."  
She suggested that women  
make use of their legal pre-  
rogatives, for "if manage-  
ment can say that women  
don't care, the laws won't  
amount to much."  

Joan Munday, Federal Women's  
Program coordinator for the  
U.S. Department of Housing  
and Urban Development (HUD),  
described federal affirma-  
tive action regulations,  
pointing out that "the re-  
sponsibility for action  
falls on those most affected  
by job discrimination."  

“The role of women employees  
is therefore more than just  
doing their job," Ms. Munday  
asserted. "We must make  
things more equal for our-  
selves, our co-workers, and  
all women who apply for jobs  
at our company."  
Federal regulations demand  
goals and timetables to

SERRE  
® How to Have  
: Intercourse  

Without Getting  
_ Screwed  

Nonmethods  
of Contraception  

The following section de-  
scribes several methods that  
traditionally have been used  
to prevent conception, but  
whose failure rate is high  
enough to make them impracti-  
cal for people serious about  
practicing contraception.  
These “nonmethods" have a  
small advantage over using  
no contraception whatever,  
but they are poor substitutes  
for the more effective means  
discussed previously.  

Coitus Interruptus  

There exist three kinds of  
male-controlled contraceptive  
methods, all of which depend  
on the male's preventing the  
entrance of semen into the  
vagina during intercourse.  
In coitus interruptus, the  
male withdraws his penis  
from the vagina and vaginal  
area just before his orgasm  
and ejaculates outside of,  
and away from, the vagina.  
One disadvantage of this  
technique is its limited ef-  
fectiveness. Pregnancy may  
result, because sperm can en-  
ter the vagina in the follow-  
ing ways.  

1. Ejaculation in stages or  
withdrawal after some  
sperm has been released  
in the vagina. It is  
possible for a small a-  
mount of sperm to be re-  
leased in the lubricant  
secreted from the penis  
prior to and during in-  
tercourse. The male may  
not be aware of this.  

2. Failure of some men to  
withdraw in time, due to  
either carelessness or  
lack of ability to pre-  
dict time of orgasm.  

3. Ejaculation near the wo-  
man's external sexual

organs, permitting the  
sperm to migrate into  
the vagina after inter-  
course is completed.*  

4. In men who aren't circum-  
cised, sperm from a pre-  
vious ejaculation can  
remain alive under the  
foreskin and can enter  
the vagina later in an  
act of intercourse.  

Apart from its being an in-  
effective contraceptive meth-  
od, many physicians and psy-  
chologists question the  
psychic and physical effects  
on both partners of coitus  
interruptus. The woman may  
experience anxiety during  
intercourse, because she can-  
not be sure her partner has  
sufficient control to with-  
draw in time, or she may  
fail to attain orgasm by the  
time her partner must with-  
draw. Men also experience  
anxiety over their own con-  
trol and perhaps feel cheated  
of the full pleasure of an  
orgasm within the vagina.  

There exist two related  
techniques, neither of which  
is recommended as being eith-  
er effective or rewarding.  
Coitus reservatus is a method  
in which the male maintains  
an erection until his partner  
has an orgasm and then with-  
draws without having ejacula-  
ted. The second technique,  
coitus obstructus, calls for

firm pressure with fingers  
at the base of the penis at  
the moment of ejaculation,  
thus channeling the semen in-  
to the man's bladder rather  
than into his partner's va-  
gina.  

Rhythm  

The rhythm method of con-  
traception requires absti-  
nence from sexual inter-  
course during the woman's  
fertile period. While the  
efficiency of this method  
is lower than the others al-  
ready discussed, its use is  
better than no contraceptive  
practice at all. The major  
difficulty in using the  
rhythm method is correctly  
determining the time of the  
fertile period. It is advis-  
able to have a physician's  
assistance in this endeavor,  
but for those who want to go  
it alone, below is a brief  
outline of how to determine  
safe and unsafe times. A  
couple may use either of two  
methods, the calendar method  
or the basal body tempera-  
ture method. Both require  
record keeping for a long  
period in advance (several  
months to a year) in order  
to establish the individual  
patterns of menstruation and  
ovulation.  

Calendar Method. To prac-  
tice this method, a woman  

must maintain a record for a

*The petting behavior in  
which the male doesn't pene-  
trate his partner, but ejac-  
ulates between the outer  
lips of the vulva or between  
her thighs, can also lead to  
pregnancy from sperm's later  
swimming into the vagina.  
This can and does happen,  
even when the woman has nev-  
er experienced penile pene-  
tration.

This is the standard chart for the rhythm 23  
method, as prescribed by doctors for many 24  

years.  

To use this chart, a woman should 25  

keep a record of her menstrual cycles for a 26  

year, counting the day on which menstruation  

27  

begins as the first day of each period. 28  
Knowing the number of days in her shortest 29  
and longest cycles, she can find her first 30  

and last unsafe days from the chart.  

Thus,  

for example, a woman whose shortest period in 32  

the past year has been twenty-four days is  

safe until the sixth day of each new period; 34  
if her longest period during the past year 35  
has been twenty-eight days, she becomes safe 36  
again after the seventeenth day of each new 37  

period.

year to determine the length  
of her longest and her short-  

est menstrual cycles. She  
can then use the chart (Table  
3) presented here to deter-  
mine which days are "unsafe."  
For example, if her shortest  
cycle during the year lasted  
25 days and her longest  
lasted 31, the first unsafe  
day (counting from the first  
day of menstruation) would  

be the seventh and the last  
unsafe day would be the  
twentieth. Thus, it would  

be necessary for her to ab-  
stain from intercourse, or  

to use some other contracep-  
tive method, for the two-  
week period. The length of  
time abstention is required  
is directly related to the  
degree of irregularity in  

the menstrual cycle. About  
15 percent of all women have  
cycles so irregular that  

they cannot use the rhythm  
method at all.  

Basal Body Temperature  
Method. This method is bas-  
ed on the fact that the re-  
lease of a ripe egg is as-  
sociated with a slight de-  
crease in body temperature.  

A day or two after the egg  

is released, the temperature  
rises again to 0.5-1.0 de-  
gree above normal. The temp-  
erature then remains the  

same until the next menstrual  
period. (See Figure 5.) If  
the woman waits until three  
days after the temperature  
rise has taken place, she  
can be sure that the egg has  
decomposed and that it is  
safe to have sexual relations  
for the duration of the  
cycle. It should be noted,  
however, that the temperature  
reading must be taken at  
about the same time every  
morning, before the woman  
gets out of bed or is active.  
Slight physiological changes,  
such as illness or nervous-  
ness, and sleeping under an  
electric blanket can affect  
the reading. Because the  
difference in temperature is  
slight, use of a special BBT  
thermometer is advised.  

Disadvantages of the rhy-  
thm method are: (a) a lack  
of effectiveness: if a hun-

record of physiological func-  
tions for a very long period  
(up to a year) before one

Douching  

Probably the least effec-

methods is douching. It en-  
tails flushing out the vagi-  
na with a solution, such as  
hot or cold water in which  
two tablespoons of vinegar  
or lemon juice have been dis-  
solved or with some commer-  
cially prepared spermicide.  
To be useful at all, douch-  
ing must be carried out im-  
mediately after intercourse.  
Estimates are that sperm  
make their way into the uter-  

us within three minutes  

after ejaculation, and once

the sperm are in the uterus,  
they cannot be washed away.  
Therefore, the effective-  

ness of douching as a con-  
traceptive is so low as to  
make it almost useless.**  

In fact, a douche actually  
can have the opposite of the  
desired effect: the pres-  
sure of the liquid may force  
sperm into the opening of  
the cervix. If a diaphragm  
or a vaginal spermicide has  
been used, a douche can  
neutralize the protective  
value and therefore should  
not be used until six to  
eight hours after inter-  
course.  

Douching is not necessary  
for vaginal hygiene. The  
vagina keeps itself clean  
through normal vaginal dis-  
charge.  

If, after reading all this,  
you still want to douche,

Chippie

By K/T

“Hey, baby, break it up:  
I said break it UP!"

Pushing aside people gathered around the two women, B.D. grabbed Katie's arms, restraining her from lashing out again at Linda.

"Break it up," she repeated, quieter this time, holding Katie a few moments longer while Linda and her friends left the bar. Assured that the fight was over, for now anyway, B.D. gently patted the crying Katie on the shoulder and left her with another woman.

And Katie's cries of "But I LOVED that woman: I LOVED HER!" were nonchalantly accepted by the Saturday night crowd as a common reaction to another broken affair. It happened every week. Women might be different. But there were always broken affairs, jealous lovers, and an occasional fight.

And B.D., or "Big Daddy," knew how to handle just about anything that might happen. She'd been bartending at the Seafish Lounge for the past twelve years and commanded the respect of everyone who frequented it.

"Hey babe! How ya' doing tonight?" she yelled to a group of women who had just noisily entered. All loudly greeted B.D. as they searched for other familiar faces in the dimly-lit room.

One of them slowly made her way through the women standing and sitting around the bar to finally reach a seat in the corner that seemed to be waiting for her.

She was about thirty years old and carried herself with a quiet assurance.

Pausing briefly from mixing drinks, B.D. looked up, then leaned over the counter to kiss her lightly on the lips with a "Hi, babe."

Both talked to each other a few seconds before B.D. continued to make drinks for the ever-increasing number of women coming in.

Earlier that night somebody had asked her if she was in love. She replied with a very negative shake of her head, and noncommittedly added: "She's growing on me, though." B.D.'s most recent affair with Pat had been going on for just two weeks.

Now Pat observed B.D. as she performed behind the bar. "She's beautiful people," said those who knew B.D., and Pat's eyes reflected that thought as she watched her.

B.D. was at her best tonight... Saturday nights, the busiest nights, always seemed to bring out whatever it was that made her friends comment: "B.D., you're cool." She never forgot a name of anyone who came in, never forgot what they drank, and never forgot to greet anyone with a grin, or a "Hi, babe, how ya' doing?"

Saturday nights were B.D.'s most interesting and wild nights. They were the nights she drank the most, danced the most, smoked the most, and laughed the most. She was laughing now, as she sang along with a song blaring from the jukebox.

Head thrown back, hands cupped under her large, firm breasts, B.D. was singing: "Babe, I do the BEST THAT I CAN!" in a laughing, infectious voice that captured the attention of everyone in the bar. As the song ended, B.D. laughingly accepted the loud, good-natured applause given her by the women who shared and acknowledged the meanings of B.D.'s gestures.

At 2:00 A.M., ten minutes from now, B.D. got off work, and she began to turn the bar over to Sue, who worked the morning shift. Actually, the name “Big Daddy" was a name given B.D. as a joke. She was only 4'10" tall.

But with B.D.'s short haircut, and tough, firm stockiness, the name fit.

Having given last directions to Sue, B.D. handed Pat her purse, took her own billfold, briskly combed her hair, and walked from her place behind the bar to sit and relax beside Pat before walking to Sally's, another bar only a block away.

B.D. liked certain things at Sally's that the Seafish didn't provide: the pool table, the bowling machine, her favorite song "Amber Light." Most of B.D.'s friends spent Saturday nights walking from Sally's to the Seafish, from the Seafish to Sally's.

"Ready to go?" B.D. asked Pat, as she put out her cigarette, and glanced questioningly at her. Pat nodded. B.D. led the way to the door, yelled her good night to everyone and Pat followed her out.

"Amber Light" was playing as they walked into Sally's. B.D. took Pat's hand, led her to an open place on the floor, and started dancing. One hand encircled Pat's shoulder, the other held Pat's hand closely to her breast. The slow strains of "Amber Light" enveloped B.D. and Pat and seemed to soften and warm Sally's sinister, dark, and smoke-filled atmosphere.

Bells from both the pinball and bowling machines, pool balls cracking sharply against one another, a marijuana scent filtering from the women's bathroom, ice clanking against the sides of glasses, murmurs, cries, laughs from liquor-perfumed breath—all were sounds and smells that filled and pervaded the room every Saturday night.

As "Amber Light" ended, B.D. and Pat walked to the counter, ordered drinks, and began their “weekend drinking." "Rock 'n Swing" vibrated through the air now—a fast, hard tune—keeping them awake, moving, drinking, until later, much later in the morning, when they would finally leave the bars and go home to recover from their Saturday night drunken activeness.

(continued on page 11)

Bis

No song played from the  
jukebox now. And the stolid  
silence pervaded, permeated,  
everything in the room.  
Standing alone in the corner  
was the pinball machine, its  
lights sending oddly shaped  
shadows to dance and flicker  
eerily on the walls.  

She was sitting there,  
slowly smoking a cigarette,  
an empty Coke glass on the  
counter beside her. Her  
face was expressionless, but  
her half-closed eyes hinted  
at the depth of her weariness.  

Occasionally the stillness  
was broken by a low comment  
from one of the persons  
seated by the counter. Few  
people were there now. And  
all seemed to be absorbed in  
their own, individual  
thoughts.  

All except Billy, who de-  
cided to begin his nightly  
teasing.  

"Hey, B.D.," he said jok-  
ingly, "Get any pussy last  
night?"  

She turned to look at him,  
then replied: "Billy, fuck  
off," in a half-irritated,  
half-amused voice.  

Unperturbed, he continued,  
"B.D., you gonna chippie on  
her? She give you enough  
pussy?"  

"Billy, FUCK OFF," she  
replied, sharper this time.  
Getting up from her stool,  
she walked over to him,  
hands on hips, and glared  
into his chuckling face.  

"Watch yourself, Billy,"  
she said warningly, "You're  
already barred from Sally's,  
you know."  

"Aw, B.D.," said Billy  
plaintively, "I was only  
kidding."  

Then he paused, only to  
look up at her a moment lat-  
er with a grin on his face.  

"Ya' still love me, B.D.?"  
he softly teased.  

"I'd love you more if you  
you'd shut your motherfuck-  
ing mouth!" grumbled B.D.  

But Billy knew she wasn't  
angry with him. She rarely  
got more than slightly ir-  
ritated with his usual harm-  
less banter and he knew how  
far he could go with his  
joking.  

"Hey, B.D."  

"NOW what the hell do you  
want, Billy?"  

Frances Boelter, employment  
specialist with HUD's St.  
Paul office, reminded women  
of the need to document  
their efforts in relieving  
job inequities. "Get it in  
writing," she urged. "Ver-  
bal promises are not enough."  

Model City Human Environment  
Planner Frankie Quade ex-  
pressed satisfaction with  
the outcome of the work-  
shop. "We've had very posi-  
tive reactions from parti-  
cipants," she said,  
"though we realize that this  
workshop didn't meet the  
needs of all persons."  

According to Ms. Quade, the  
Model City Women's Task  
Force is planning further  
workshops in specific em-  
ployment difficulties.  

"Trust me for a beer, will  
ya?"  

"BILLY!" she yelled, faking  
her anger with him again.  
Then she looked at him, her  
eyes slightly twinkling, en-  
joying the mock fight be-  
tween them.  

"Billy, you know I don't  
trust anybody but myself,"  
she stated.  

"Nobody?" he asked, half-  
seriously.  

B.D. looked at him a long  
time, then finally turned a-  
way.  

"Nope, Billy, only my-  
self," she said, almost in-  
audibly, her eyes toward the  
window, gazing into the dark  
night beyond.  

Everyone had left the bar  
by closing time. And B.D.  
put out her last cigarette  
for the night. She automati-  
cally, almost mechanically,  
emptied the ashtrays, then  
rinsed out glasses left on  
the counter. She looked at  
the clock. 2:00 A.M. A  
faintly discernible sigh  
escaped from her as she  
looked around, before walk-  
ing out the door and lock-  
ing it. Another Tuesday  
night at the Seafish was  
over.

Anthropologist Elaine Mor-
gan has written a book de-
tailing her theories about
human evolution. Her ideas
are marked by refreshing
clarity and insightful cur-
iosity. This is in marked
contrast to books by most
male anthropologists, whose
premises seem to be based on
the common preconception that
all results of human evolu-
tion occurred either for the
purpose of making the Mighty
Hunter mightier or to make
the sex object sexier. Mor-
gan states, "The longer I
went on reading his own book
books about himself, the
more I longed to find a vol-
ume that would begin: ‘When
the first ancestor of the hu-
man race descended from the
trees, she had not yet devel-
oped the mighty brain that
was to distinguish her so
sharply from all other spe-
cies.'"

The Descent
of Woman

Morgan explores the one-
sidedness of most anthropo-
logy, beginning with a dis-
cussion of androcentric
speech, and leads into the
manly myths that dominate
the science.

She disputes the idea that
"woman is a distorted ver-
sion of the original blue-
print.”

For example—most male
anthropologists agree that
men became bipedal for pur-
poses of speed in the hunt,
even though quadrupeds run
faster than bipeds. Morgan
maintains that with the
drought of the 12-million
Pliocene era, the prehomin-
ids, former tree-dwellers,
took to the sea for protec-
tion when there were no more
trees to climb. They stood
upright to keep their heads
above water.

The Pliocene era is a
blank page in history; there
is little archeological ev-
idence pointing out where
prehominids were during that
time. Morgan submits that
they became sea dwellers.
There is little evidence be-
cause the weapons, pebbles,
were common on the beach and
worn by the water, and bones
washed to the sea.

Further evidence is that
we lost our furry hair to
aid rapid swimming (we would
have needed it to protect
our tender skin on land).

Also, we developed layers of
subcutaneous fat to keep us
warm in the water (it would
have added to the unbearable
heat on land). Similar hair
and fat evolution can be
seen in other mammals: the
walrus, porpoise, and hippo.

The reason she gives for
long hair remaining on the
human's head is that the
head would be the only part
of the body out of the water
and exposed to the sun; also,
a baby could grasp the mo-
ther's long hair and float
in the water.

Morgan explains why wo-
man developed larger
breasts than their primate
ancestors: with the loss
of chest hair, children
would have nothing to

hang onto. Babies whose
mother's breasts were lar-
ger survived more often,
and that physical trait be-
gan to predominate. We did
not develop larger breasts
to attract the Mighty Hunt-
er!

That idea, as she says,
is "a circular argument...
It's like saying that a wo-
man walks with a wiggle be-
cause this is attractive to
a male. In fact, she only
walks with a wiggle because
her children are so intell-
igent. The necessity of
passing a large-skulled in-
fant's head through her pel-
vic ring has prevented her
skeleton from adapting to
bipedalism quite as grace-
fully as that of her bro-
thers; and males only find
this defect attractive be-
cause they associate it with
femininity."

Other traits developed as
our aquatic visit length-
ened: webbing between fin-
gers and toes (we still have
vestigial webbing between
thumb and forefinger). Our
noses became streamlined to
keep out excess water. We
developed tear glands to

secrete salt. The ability
to frown began to protect our
eyes from the glare of
the sun on the water. 
Something else happened—

we developed large buttocks.
Contrary to androcentric
thinking, it was not for the
purpose of sexual attraction.
Females would sit on the
beach to nurse their babies.
The fatty tissue built up
and the vaginal orifice
moved in and forward for
protection from the sand.
This point introduces
three interesting chapters
in the book: orgasm, love,
and aggression. Morgan says
that as the buttocks built
up, the male could no longer
reach the vagina in the nor-
mal rear-mounting position.
In order to achieve coitus,
he had to switch to a front-
al approach. This had two
immediate consequences: the
female was terrified; and
she was unable to reach or-
gasm. Her body was designed
for sexual approaches from
the rear; a frontal approach
was understood as an attack.
Her sexual initiative was
met by violence and she was
confused.

Also, the penis was no
longer entering the vagina
at the best angle to
"scratch the itch," and she
experienced sexual frustra-
tion for the first time.
The third result of the
switch to the frontal ap-
proach: sex and aggression
became linked in the human
mind. For the male, sex
became associated with ag-
gression, for the female,
with terror. Also, more
aggressive males had more
offspring since they
achieved coitus more often,
and aggression spread in
the species.

Morgan concludes her book
with several chapters in
which she traces facts of
everyday life to prehistory
things like race memory,
the development of speech,
sex roles, the Tarzan myth,
and differences in politi-
cal inclinations of the
sexes. The last chapter
sums it all up with her
“state of the movement"
evaluation. She ends on a
hopeful note:

"It may be that for Homo
sapiens in the future, ex-
treme manifestations of the

The

“Recently, through the Les-  
bian Resource Center, a  
group for lesbian mothers  
was started. Our core mem-  
bers are presently in the  
midst of giving the group  
some direction and meaning.  

The problems of being a  
mother are numerous, whether  
the mother is straight, mar-

gay mother has the same  
problems as the straight  
mother plus the fact that  
her unconventional life-

triple bind. She is the  
minority of the minority of  
the minority. She is first  
a woman, then a gay, and  
then a mother. The need to  
relate to the life-style of  
raising children is great  
and immediate. This is why  
the group was started. We  
need support from women who  
are mothers and women who  
are relating to children.  
We need lawyers and other  
people who will rap with us.  
We need the moral support of  
others like us and the sup-  
port of other gay sisters.  

How does the lesbian be-  
come a mother? The same way  
any other woman becomes a  
mother. Some of us were  
married and came out after  
our marriages. Some of us  
gave life to children  
because families and society  
expected us to do this.  
Some of us wanted children--  
we never married but we  
surrounded ourselves with children.  
Some of us were raped and  
some of us just didn't know  
any better. Whatever the  
reasons, we are here. We  
have chosen to have children  
and we feel that we are fit  
mothers. We have fears and  
pain and joys and successes.  
We want to show the world  
that we are not unfit moth-  
ers because we are lesbians.  
We want our children to  
grow up and be free to  
choose their own life-style  
and not be poisoned by a  
bigoted society. Our child-  
ren will know pain just as  
we know pain but that is how  
we grew and that is how they  
will grow.  

If you are interested in  
relating to children in any  
way, whether you are a moth-  
er, the lover of a mother,  
whatever you are, we want  
you. Join our group and  
help us and we'll help you.  
We meet on Tuesday evenings  
at 8:00 at 2314 Elliot Ave-  
nue South, Minneapolis.  

Some of the gay women from  
the Resource Center have  
been babysitting for our  
kids while we rap so feel  
free to bring your kids.  

The Elliot Ave. address is  
a neutral meeting ground.  
There is no label attached  
to coming there. There are  
many lesbian mothers in the  
area who are afraid to come  
to a place that labels them  
as lesbians for one reason  
or another and we understand  
that.  

Some of you are frightened  
and we can feel that fright.  
We know it is painful, but  
we need you and we can all  
help each other if only we  
can meet and talk.  

If for any reason you can-  
not come to us I would like  
to give you my phone number.  
Call on me if you want more  
information or if you just  
need to talk. My phone num-  
ber is 722-1519.

you at our meetings.

at times, watching an ex-

It's about time we quit

30 Metro School Districts Charged
With Failure to Hire Women Teachers

Ellen Dresselhuis, President of the Minnesota Divi- 
sion of Women's Equity Ac- 
tion League (WEAL) announced 
this week that WEAL in con- 
junction with Susan B. An- 
thony's birthday, Feb. 15, 
has filed suit with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) charging 
sex discrimination in the 
employment of senior high 
school teachers. Duplicate 
complaints have been filed with the 
U.S. Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare (HEW). 
On the basis of research 
done by WEAL, it found that 
1/3 of the school districts 
in the metropolitan area 
have no females in their 
senior high social studies 
departments, 1/3 have fewer 
than 10%, and the remaining 
1/3 have 10-38%. Only two 
school districts (West St. Paul 
and South St. Paul) have 
female representation in 
senior high social studies 
proportionate to their 
availability for hiring. 
The percentage of women 
hired as senior high social 
studies teachers does not re- 
flect the availability of 
women for these positions. 
In 1972, at the Sees

behavior patterns of dom-

be evolutionarily at a dis-

All a people got to do is 
hold out loving arms to 
him and say: 
"Come on in. The water's 
lovely."

"Forget it," she says, "unless it's some 
rat-infested, roach-infested dump, then 
it's okay." 
Finances are an omnipresent problem 
WOMEN ON WELFARE 
to Sally, as to other AFDC mothers. 
"Welfare discourages women from going 
(continued from page 1) out to work. You can't make enough on 
your own to raise your family," she 
says. "If you work, you probably can't 
earn more than you'd get on AFDC." 
As for social life, "you just hang it 
up," Sally says. 
"You don't see people at work, you 
don't have money to go out. If your 
friends aren't on AFDC, their husbands 
might not want them to associate with 
you. You can just about forget about 
having a social life. 
"People get so concerned about the 
money spent on welfare. Well, I wonder 
about all the money spent on that war."
